07635-89d_stil.jpg	The attribution of this still-life to Caravaggio is doubtful.From a thematic point of view, large scale still-lifes in the Galleria Borghese are similar to outstanding early works by Caravaggio, but they lack the brilliance and the concentration on individual objects. This painting and another are usually attributed to Caravaggio. Because it is rather unconvincing to attribute such work to Caravaggio, some scholars distinguish this Caravaggesque painter of still-lifes from the master by naming him - after a splendid example of the genre - the Painter of the Still-Life in the Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford.

10998-307david.jpg	When David was released from the Luxembourg prison at the end of December 1794, he became ill and so requested permission from the Convention to visit his wife's sister and her husband, Emilie and Pierre S�riziat, at their country house in Saint Ouen, near Tournan-en-Brie, about 32 km (20 miles) east of Paris. This visit was cut short by the accusations of May 1795 and arrest, but he returned there, accompanied by a guard, to recuperate after his second and final release in August. He then painted the portraits of his hosts. Madame S�riziat is shown in an interior setting with her young son, having just returned from a walk. Her cheeks are ruddy and she carries a recently picked bunch of wild flowers which are painted in a lively but meticulous manner.These two portraits were testaments of friendship and, by showing them at the 1795 Salon, he could prove that he was still able to paint after his ordeals

05288-2lastjud.jpg	The left wing of the triptych represents the Paradise.Here, across the three inner panels, appear the First and Last Things, beginning with the Fall of Man on the left wing.The story recounted in the second and third chapters of Genesis has been placed in a lush garden; in the foreground we see the creation of Eve, followed by the temptation of the First Couple. In the middle distance they are driven from the garden by an angel. The expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden is paralleled above by the expulsion from Heaven of the Rebel Angels, who are transformed into monsters as they descend to earth. Although the revolt of proud Lucifer and his followers is not mentioned in Genesis, it appears in Jewish legends and entered Christian doctrine at an early age. These were the angels who sinned and whose prince, envying Adam, caused him to sin in turn. It was further believed that Adam and Eve had been created by God in order that their offspring might fill the places left vacant by the fallen angels. In this panel, Bosch thus depicted the entrance of sin into the world and accounted for the necessity of the Last Judgment.The inclusion of the Fall of Adam and Eve in a representation of the Last Judgment is unusual; the other two panels of the Vienna triptych depart even more from traditional iconography

42101-19studi2.jpg	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments. Two doors, not distinguished in any way from the cupboard doors, cover the only windows: Francesco preferred to work by candlelight.The intimate scale of the project allowed Vasari and his pupils to develop their imaginative abilities, technical skill, and jewel-like delicacy of colour. Eight sculptors made the bronze statuettes, and the paintings were by twenty-four artists. This precious chamber is the only sixteenth-century room in Europe to survive with its oil paintings intact

12539-07docto.jpg	At the same time as the Feast of the Rose Garlands, D�rer was working on the painting of Christ among the Doctors. The theme derives from the Gospel of St Luke (Luke 2, 41-52).On the bookmark at the bottom left of the panel, D�rer has recorded that this picture was `the work of five days', a pointed reference to his inscription on The Altarpiece of the Rose Garlands, the work of five months. Christ among the Doctors is not only a smaller panel, but the brushwork is much more spontaneous and the paint is applied with broad and fluid strokes. Despite D�rer's statement about five days, he based it on a number of careful studies, including one of Christ's gesticulating fingers. Although not present on the original painting, two early copies of the panel have the word `Romae' added to the inscription on the bookmark and this suggests that D�rer visited Rome late in 1506. It may also be significant that the original painting was in Rome's Galleria Barberini until its acquisition by Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza in 1935.The story recorded in the panel is of Christ's visit to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, where he debated with the learned Jewish doctors (or scribes). According to the Bible, this was the first occasion on which Christ taught. D�rer's daring composition does not use the conventional temple setting which he earlier used in the lower left panel of The Seven Sorrows of the Virgin. Instead he gives a close-up view of the faces of six doctors crowding round the young Jesus. The elderly doctors, caricatured faces which may well have been influenced by Leonardo da Vinci, argue with Christ by quoting from the Scriptures and gesticulating. Christ, a sober boy of 12, quietly gestures with his fingers to make a point. D�rer contrasts Christ's youthful hands with the gnarled fingers of the ugly old man with the white cap and a gap-toothed grin

17950-windmill.jpg	"The tonal style in Dutch landscape painting of the 1630s continued well into the 1640s, while still developing, especially in the hands of Jan van Goyen. The direction in which van Goyen took landscape reveals a considered logic; as tonal painting was a realistic attempt to capture an atmosphere, its consequence was, in the end, to paint the sky over the flat, low land. Thus, in his ""Windmill by a River"", the real subject is the moving skies.Everything is subordinated to the high sky, a sky that seems to take on the colour of the vast land stretching to a low, distant horizon: a brownish-green with tinges of blue. Only the sky contains more grey - the clouds - and is more transparent in its pictorial treatment. Dunes in the foreground, caught in a splash of sunlight, introduce the distance - suggesting a high viewpoint that gives the view naturalness. The windmill, painted in the greyish-brown colour of the sky, is a discreet spatial reference point"

41099-021pieta.jpg	The Man of Sorrows in the arms of God the Father with the Holy Ghost between them both is a kind of Seat of Mercy or more exactly a Trinity Piet&#224;. The type is met with frequently in French and Burgundian court painting from the end of the fourteenth century onwards. One of the best known and earliest preserved examples is the tondo by Jean Malouel in the Louvre. Both in the common Man of Sorrows type and in the Trinity Piet&#224;, angels are often supporting Christ's body on both sides or carrying instruments of the Passion. The small Cologne work is part of this tradition. The Man of Sorrows is flanked by four angels, with two of them holding the Flagellation column, the scourge, the stick with the sponge and the lance. This type clearly forms the basis of the Man of Sorrows borne by an angel by Master Francke which in turn led to the Virgin showing Man of Sorrows by Memling (Melbourne).

36867-pentapt3.jpg	This panel belonged to a now dismembered pentaptych (five-paneled altarpiece). In its original configuration, St Benedict was the left, St Silvester Gozzolini the right and the Madonna and Child the centre panels (all in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The centre panel was flanked by panels depicting St John the Baptist (Perkins Collection, Sacro Convento di San Francesco, Assisi), and St John the Evangelist (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).When intact, the altarpiece would have resembled Duccio's polyptych in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena (the so-called polyptych 47). The pairing of Sts John the Baptist and John the Evangelist - the forerunner of Christ and the beloved disciple - to either side of the Madonna and Child is not uncommon and may relate either to the dedication of the chapel or to the name of the patron. On the other hand, the presence of Sts Benedict (c. 480&#150;543) and Silvester Gozzolini (1177&#150;1267) virtually assures that the altarpiece was painted for a monastery of the Silvestrine order, which was founded by Silvester in 1231 and followed the rule of St Benedict

08837-isaac.jpg	Cigoli's picture depicts one of the most dramatic moments in the Old Testament (Genesis 22: 1-14), where the Lord tests Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice his only son Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to slit Isaac's throat an angel miraculously appears and points to a ram, tangled in a thicket, that can be sacrificed instead. Cigoli shows the moment at which the angel intervenes, pulling back Abraham's arm as he points to the ram. According to Cigoli's nephew, Giovanni Battista Cardi, the picture was painted while his uncle was working for Cardinal Pompeo Arrigoni in Frascati just outside Rome. Cigoli, a Florentine, is documented in Rome between 1606-07, a date which accords well with the style of The Sacrifice of Isaac. There are several preparatory studies for the painting, one of which is on the verso of a drawing for Massimo Massimi's Ecce Homo of 1607, making it safe to assume that Cigoli was working on both pictures at the same time.Although The Sacrifice of Isaac was painted in Rome, the composition clearly recalls the Florentine tradition of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Andrea del Sarto. Isaac's sensuous nude body, however, reflects the artist's first-hand experience of classical sculpture. Despite the inherent suspense of the narrative, the picture itself lacks dramatic tension. Abraham's massive red tunic serves as a foil for Isaac's unblemished adolescent body, shifting the emphasis to the work's more lascivious characteristics. When the picture was criticised for its sexually evocative content by a visitor to Arrigoni's villa, the cardinal made an eloquent defence of the artist and the painting. The emotions evoked, he said, were the result of Cigoli's excellence as a painter; any stimulation was the fault of the viewer

11679-6west.jpg	This fresco is located in the 5th bay on the west wall of the Pellegrinaio in the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala. The Pellegrinaio, situated on the ground floor of the hospital, is a fourteenth-century room which took the form of a long vaulted hall.In the four scenes on the west wall, painted by Domenico di Bartolo, we find large numbers of figures gathered in a stagelike foreground and engaged in the various good works assigned to the hospital by statute in 1305. The settings for these depictions of everyday work of the hospital may reproduce actual spaces within the complex. For all their realism, the scenes are highly idealised.In the Caring for the Sick Domenico combines specific portraiture with a sensitive treatment of the nude figure. The unidealized bodies of the sick man being placed in bed and the wounded man being washed rank among the most naturalistic figures in Quattrocento painting

20406-virgin_c.jpg	This painting was discovered in 1989 and attributed to Isenbrant. It was carefully copied, albeit in a different style, from Memling's Berlin Virgin Enthroned. The figure has been copied from Memling's work by means of a punch-cardboard and the colours also correspond, which shows that the work was then still accessible in Bruges. Isenbrant carried out some adaptations in Renaissance style, turning the original open portico into a semi-circular niche with medallions, baluster columns and a solid stone throne. Moreover, the book of hours has been given sixteenth-century floral borders in the Ghent-Bruges style and the flat top of the panel changed into an ogive shape.It is a remarkable example of the way in which Memling's compositions served as models until the sixteenth century

14347-descent.jpg	Ambrosius Francken was a member of the second generation of the family of painters in Antwerp. He was a Mannerist, and like other painters in the Low Countries in the last third of the 16th century, he became eclectic, a trend which itinerant Netherlandish artists of international culture helped to establish. His art was somewhat artificial, and his agitated style never achieved true pathos.This panel was painted 25 years before Rubens' Descent from the Cross, also in the Antwerp Cathedral. A simple comparison of the two works speaks about the artistic development that took place that short space of time, due not least to Rubens' own special genius

43921-penn.jpg	The genre in which English painters were least happy in the second half of the 18th century was history painting; the efforts of Reynolds in this direction are strangely petrified for so living a painter. Yet it was through history painting that Neo-Classicism invaded the art in England. A Scot, Gavin Hamilton (1738-1820) and an American, Benjamin West, who enjoyed a prodigious success, were in advance of the French painter Jacques-Louis David in the conception of a painting as a scene from Classical history, based upon thorough archeological research.West was most successful when least pretentious; his illustrations of English historical events are simply illustrations, simply composed, uneffectedly direct. Neo-classicism had trained West to give value to the facts of the scene depicted, removing anything merely decorative or liable to spoil the sense of witnessing an actual event

15510-6resurr.jpg	"The official prestige value of the upper picture on the main chapel wall (the Confirmation of the Rule) is clear. In contrast, the fresco beneath it, directly above the altarpiece, is devoted to the Sassetti family's private history. In 1478, the year of the Pazzi plot, their son Teodoro died; but a few months later Nera Corsi Sassetti gave birth to a second son. As they felt him to be a gift from God, they made yet another change in the plans for the altar wall in their mortuary chapel. Ghirlandaio had to abandon his design for a scene showing the appearance of Saint Francis in Arles, for which preliminary drawings still exist, and paint the Resurrection of the Boy. This was how the Sassetti intended to express their gratitude for their new-bon son Teodoro II.The events in the Resurrection of the Boy are taking place just outside the church of Santissima Trinita at the Ponte Santissima Trinita. ""... In it he represented the Ponte Santissima Trinita (the old one, by Taddeo Gaddi; the present one was built by Ammannati almost a hundred years later) with the palace of the Spini, the first scene showing the appearance of St Francis in the air to raise a child of that family... and other figures who are marvelling and rejoicing at the miracle, affording no little pleasure to the rest of us. Among them are portraits of Agnolo Acciaioli, Palla Strozzi..."" (Vasari).While playing, a boy falls out of the windows of the Palazzo Spini. A red ball falling to the street below him. Some passers-by see the falling child, rush up in help, but it is too late: the child is dead. The boy who met with the fatal accident is already lying on a bier surrounded by mourners. Then, however, two Franciscans succeed in interceding with Saint Francis on their behalf, and the child is brought back to life. The artist moved this miracle from Rome where it actually took place, to Florence - just outside the church in which the picture is painted  in order to be able to incorporate many of the portraits requested by the donor in the groups of onlookers"

There is a new emphasis on local colour and an orderly arrangement. The reason for the shift in Ostade's mood has not been established.

41290-06martin.jpg	The panel, painted on both sides, was part of the moving wing of a winged altarpiece. The panel represents the best-known episode from the legend of St. Martin.

In the interior represented on the left side of the picture another episode from the legend can be seen. Christ appears at night to Martin, who suddenly realizes that it was the Saviour himself who put him to the test in the guise of a beggar.

03746-miracl3.jpg	"This canvas depicts the healing of Pietro dei Ludovici. The miracle, which occurred through contact with a processional candle which had touched the relic of the Holy Cross, takes place inside a chapel which is in large part occupied by an extremely elegant ciborium surmounted by the eagle symbol of St John the Evangelist. This detail and also the triptych on the altar which recalls the one painted by Bastiani in his canvas depicting the ""Donation of the Relic"", suggests that Gentile Bellini wished here to set the scene in the interior of the church of St John the Evangelist.

06590-5sense1.jpg	This piece, a characteristic product of the Rubens workshop, is one of the paintings in the series depicting the five senses. The allegorical content of these works was always obvious, and the pieces of the series did not become separated. The still-life details enumerating many traditional symbols were painted by Jan Brueghel.The amazing increase in the commercial and agricultural product range caused a complete restructuring of people's perception - a change which can be seen very clearly in the numerous paintings and series of paintings on the subject of the Five Senses. Jan Brueghel the Elder's famous variations on this motif - now in the Prado, Madrid - show a number of settings, each of which is associated with the five senses. The dramatic 'unity of character' has been divided into components of the senses, thus reflecting an increasing compartmentalization of the world into functional spheres - a world which is defined in terms of luxury goods.In Jan Brueghel's paintings, the part of purely passive reception or physical consumption is played by an allegorical female figure. Interestingly, by depicting her naked or semi-naked breasts and sometimes her entire body, the painter emphasizes an element of eroticism. In this way the consumption of luxury goods and an emotional state of ecstasy are recognized as a syndrome.In the still-life of Hearing we can examine nearly all the instruments of the period. Near the Flemish harpsichord we can see a drum, a trumpet, a trombone, a cornetto, a lysard, several flutes, various sizes of violas and gambas, a lute, and a shawm. On a table to the right are a small horn, a trumpet, a bell and a reed pipe. The title of the musical score reveals that it is a six-part madrigal dedicated to Prince Pietro Philippi Albert and to Princess Isabella. The rifle, leaned against the chair, is rendered as a sound-producing implement, along with the other musical instruments used during a hunt; it does not unequivocally refer to Mars, as it has been proposed. In this painting the clock is not the symbol of transitoriness, rather it is a musical clock, several versions of which are visible in the right background. The talking and singing birds were also included on account of their voices. In the hall opening from the left rear, members of a musical group are entertaining themselves. The pictures on the wall of the room also refer to music: they depict the concert of the gods and Orpheus taming the wild animals with his music. The triptych showing the Annunciation and the announcement to the shepherds depicted on the inside cover of the harpsichord are also episodes which can be associated with sound.The nude female figure is, according to some opinions, Euterpe, the Muse of music, while others see her as Venus. The goddess of love may indeed be looked for in a painting associated with the human senses. Such supposition is supported by the presence of a little cherub (Amor?) in four of the five pictures, although he is only depicted as a winged Amor in the allegories of Touch and Sight.As an animal famous for its keen hearing, the stag became the symbol for this sense. In his Iconologia, Ripa prescribes the inclusion of a stag at the side of a woman playing the lute

10944-doria2.jpg	The left wing of the diptych depicts the Virgin and Child in the Church, while the right wing the donor Antonio Siciliano and St Anthony.The diptych was commissioned by Antonio Siciliano who served as chamberlain and secretary to Massimiliano Sforza, the Duke of Milan. In 1513 he was dispatched to Margaret of Austria in Mechelen on a diplomatic mission. It is assumed that Siciliano commissioned the painting from Gossart, who about 1513 worked at Margaret's court in Mechelen. However, the authorship of the diptych is debated, especially that of the donor (right) wing. Several alternative suggestions were proposed, the authorship being connected to the Antwerp Mannerists or to the artists contributing to the Grimani Breviary. Presently the right wing is attributed to Jan Gossart.The left panel is attributed to Gerard David. This attribution is supported by recent technical examination. More than any other Bruges painter, David inherited Jan van Eyck's legacy. The left panel of the diptych is an adaptation of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. David made adjustments to the earlier model: he centred the Virgin in a wider view of the nave, added a third arch to the choir screen, and closed off the composition at the right with a series of columns matching those of the bays opposite

22256-c_couple.jpg	"Judith Leyster is one of the very few women to have been accepted as a member of the Haarlem Guild of Painters. Although a contemporary historian described her as a leading light in art (punning on her name Leyster, which means ""lodestar"") she remained unknown for a long time and her works were either believed lost, or were attributed to Frans Hals. She probably worked in his studio around 1630 and was also a friend of his family, for one year later she became godmother to Hals' daughter Maria.Like Hals at the same time, the young Leyster adopted the style of the Utrecht Caravaggisti, with their strong chiaroscuro modelling in the manner of Caravaggio. From the mid-1620, she concentrated more on vividly illuminated genre scenes, generally featuring half figures of merry musicians, gamblers and whores, strongly influenced by the painting of Terbrugghen and Honthorst.While the Utrecht school of painters still rounded the surfaces of their objects smoothly between light and shade, Hals and his school adopted a broad, vibrant and independent brushstroke. Leyster's work can be distinguished from that of Hals through her generally more discordant handling of colour, her sketchier treatment of hands, the wryly distorted smiles of her figures and her altogether flightier brushwork"

In 1833, it was separated from the palace complex, and has since served as the Armeria Reale, housing the Savoyard weapon collection.The subject of the ceiling painting in the Galleria is the legend of Aeneas, the mortal son of Venus who escaped from the burning Troy with his father and his son, and after many trials and misadventures landed at last at the mouth of the Tiber. There he became through his son Ascanius the progenitor of the gens Julia.The picture shows one of the two tondi with Aeneas Landing on the Mouth of the Tiber

09970-decadenc.jpg	The peak in theatrical Romanticism came in the Salon of 1847, Couture, a pupil of Gros, exhibited this painting nearly eight meters long. It had been commissioned by the government for the Palais du Luxembourg. One can see the work as the sum of all that French painting had striven for between the Neoclassical period and Romanticism. Not only does the work cite painterly and compositional devices from old masters like Veronese, Tiepolo, Rubens and Poussin, but to Couture's contemporaries the artist also seemed to have succeeded in combining Antiquity and the present. It is all to be found united here:  the antique columned hall, sculpture competing with living figures, beautiful forms created with line  in the manner of Ingres, and Delaroche's delight in detail.A woman is the central figure, placed so that she will draw all eyes. She is stretched out in the middle of a large crowd of people who are abandoning themselves to all the vices that are supposed to have led to the downfall of Roma. The scene is framed by five larger-than-life-size sculptures representing men from Roman history, their gestures seeming to demand a return to virtue

39841-0chieri1.jpg	The Villa Chiericati was built in the first half of the sixteenth century for Ludovico Chiericati, a nobleman from Vicenza. It underwent numerous restorations and reworkings over time, resulting in its current architectural form, an extended structure with a simple fa�ade that is barely enlivened by a tympanum supported by four Ionic pilasters. A room on the north side, called Room of Landscapes, was decorated with six frescoes of landscape scenes, each incorporating two zodiac signs, by Lodewijk Toeput. During one of the updatings the frescoes were painted over, and it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century, on the occasion of yet another restoration, that they were finally revealed.The landscapes contain explicit references to the sequence of the seasons and their related zodiac signs, the marking of time that rhythmically measures the work and the days of good guardianship of the land. These are extremely naturalistic paintings, at times enlivened by the presence of slender little figures rendered with a touch of vitality.On the wall shown in the present picture, the vivid figure of the page and his greyhound stand out flanked by a Landscape between Autumn and Winter and a Winter Landscape

44024-0braque.jpg	"The armorial bearings on the back indicate that this portable triptych was the property of Jehan Braque and his wife Catherine de Brabant, of Tournai, who were married in about 1450-51. Jehan Braque died soon afterwards, in 1452; his young widow, who did not marry again till 1461, must have commissioned this triptych in his memory.The Braque Triptych ranks among Rogier van der Weyden's most celebrated works. It is a small-scale work of the kind that were set upon portable altars in the oratories of wealthy individuals. When closed, it shows the classical vanity theme, a skull and a cross. Open, it displays images of Christ in the centre, and to either side - the Virgin, St John the Evangelist, St John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene. They are represented against a landscape that is rendered down to the finest detail, with its rivers and mountains, grass and leaves so precisely drawn they could almost be counted and tiny figures visible in the distance in the streets of imaginary towns - a favourite motif of the Flemish masters.Pictures showing busts of Christ and the Virgin had existed earlier north of the Alps, but a sequence of several saints shown half length seems to derive from a type of altarpiece found in Italy from the 13th century onward. The innovation is to place them in front of a wide, coherent landscape relating to the figures themselves not realistically, but in context. It stands for the entire world ruled by Christ and to which He descended incarnate as man, as described at the beginning of the Gospel of St John: ""And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."" If the dark exterior was a reminder of the inevitability of death, the wide, radiant interior with its saintly figures allowed the devout viewer to hope for salvation.Artistically, the triptych is very close to the Beaune Altarpiece. The head of the Virgin Mary, and in particular the head of Christ, are so like their counterparts in the picture of the Last Judgment that they must have been executed from the same cartoon (full-size design for a painting). It is not certain whether the work is entirely by Rogier's hand; the underdrawing reveals thin lines not at all typical of him, and perhaps done with a pen instead of Rogier's usual brush. There are also some differences in the artistic execution: the Virgin's face, for instance, looks waxen, and inflexible around the eyes by comparison with the wonderful, tenderly painted, and lifelike Mary Magdalene, which is among Rogier's finest works"
