39150-14zianig.jpg	This fresco comes from the Tiepolo family house (villa) at Zianigo, between Padua and Venice. Gian Domenico's fresco cycle has been detached and is now preserved in the Ca' Rezzonico. This scene decorated the portego or gallery-salon of the family villa.Here Gian Domenico reverts to the treatment of composition which his father brought to a similar scene in the Villa Valmarana near Monteberico (dated to 1737 or 1757). But here he amplifies the original conception into a wider view in keeping with his own enlarged horizon, shifting things on to a new plane of visual perspective. Broad expanses of hazy brown set off the vivid figures from the cold hues of the surroundings. Gian Domenico moves these images into close contact with their setting, lodging them, like other 'paternal archetypes' of his, in an empirical space.The scenes from life represented appear under a new and novel aspect of landscape and environment.The elegant lady promenading on the arms of her husband and beau is also accompanied by her favourite lap dog held by a man servant. It is the artist's clear intention to achieve verisimilitude in the portrayal of people and things

05064-ariadne.jpg	Paulus Bor is one of the most remarkable artists of the seventeenth century. He was a man of substantial means and was presumably not dependent on his income from painting. For this reason, perhaps, his pictures look like the work of an intellectual dilettante, not unlike those by his fellow townsman Jacob van Campen. Bor seldom signed or dated his pictures, and it is therefore difficult to attribute or date them. His extraordinary paintings, many of which are strange compositions rendered in an almost primitive technique, are all the more unusual because they are often of obscure and enigmatic subjects

37115-moses.jpg	The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Moses in the Sistine Chapel. It is located in the sixth compartment on the south wall.The fresco depicts the last episodes  in the life of Moses. On the right sits the hundred-and-twenty-year-old Moses on a rise, holding his staff and with golden rays circling his head. At Moses's feet stands the ark of the Covenant, opened to show the jar of manna inside and the two tables of the law. In the left half of the picture Joshua is appointed Moses's successor. Joshua kneels before Moses, who gives him his staff. In the centre of the background we see Moses being led by the angel of the Lord up Mount Nebo, from which he will be able to look across to the Promised Land that by the will of God he will never enter. At the foot of the mountain we see him again, turning toward the left. His death is depicted in the background, in the land of Moab, where the children of Israel mourned him for thirty days.Signorelli must have been just over thirty, when he became involved in the decoration of the Sistine Chapel. Luca's name does not appear among the group of Tuscan and Umbrian artists  (Cosimo Rosselli, Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Perugino) who, on 27 October 1481, signed the contract for the decoration of the side walls of the famous chapel, which were to be frescoed with Biblical scenes. But Vasari is absolutely certain of his involvement and his hand is evident in some details of the huge scene of Moses's Testament and Death. The painting, at any rate as it appears to us today, is for the most part the work of Bartolomeo della Gatta, reflecting his typical use of vibrant colour and subtle lighting. But, amidst the numerous figures that populate the scene, there are some whose anatomical description is full of energy and who convey powerful emotions: the young nude seated in the centre, for example, or the two clothed figures portrayed with their backs to the onlooker, or the man with the stick leaning against Moses's throne. Luca Signorelli's hand appears quite obvious in these details, and in others as well

05209-11centre.jpg	At first sight, the central panel confronts us with an idyll unique in Bosch's work: an extensive park-like landscape teeming with nude men and women who nibble at giant fruits, consort with birds and animals, frolic in the water and, above all, indulge in a variety of amorous sports overtly and without shame. A circle of male riders revolves like a great carousel around a pool of maidens in the centre and several figures soar about in the sky on delicate wings. This triptych is better preserved than most of Bosch's large altarpieces, and the carefree mood of the central panel is heightened by the clear and even lighting, the absence of shadows, and the bright, high-keyed colours. The pale bodies of the inhabitants, accented by an occasional black-skinned figure, gleam like rare flowers against the grass and foliage. Behind the gaily coloured fountains and pavilions of the background lake, a soft line of hills melts into the distance. The diminutive figures and the large, fanciful vegetable forms seem as harmless as the medieval ornament which undoubtedly inspired them. We might be in the presence of the childhood of the world, when men and beasts dwelt in peace together and the earth yielded her fruit abundantly and without effort.Nevertheless, this crowd of naked lovers was not intended as an apotheosis of innocent sexuality. The sexual act, which the twentieth century has learned to accept as a normal part of the human condition, was most often seen by the Middle Ages as proof of man's fall from the state of angels, at best a necessary evil, at worst a deadly sin. That Bosch shared fully in this view is confirmed by the fact that his garden, like the haywain in his other triptych, is situated between Eden and Hell, the origin of sin and its punishment. Hence, just as the Haywain depicts worldly gain or Avarice, so the Garden of Earthly Delights depicts the sensual life, more specifically the deadly sin of Lust

23441-lugano1.jpg	The partition in Santa Maria degli Angeli in Lugano was frescoed in 1529 by Bernardino Luini. In contrast to early examples, Luini unites the entire wall into a single picture plane. To achieve a huge, overwhelming scenographic effect, Luini relinquished any division of the wall into small parts. The view looks through an illusionistic architectural frame to an enormous, crowded panorama of the Crucifixion. In the foreground, the crosses, Christ's death, and reactions of people push right up to the viewer, as if to the edge of a stage. Small, separate subsidiary scenes are arranged in the background landscape. In a symmetrical arrangement, three episodes on the left that preceded the Crucifixion are contrasted with three episodes on the right that followed Christ's death

30688-f_giants.jpg	Andrea Doria (1466-1560) was the dominant figure in Genoa in his times. He was an extraordinarily talented naval commander. Coming from an impoverished branch of an ancient local family, he succeeded in enriching himself and reestablishing Genoese independence after protracted domination by the French. His fellow citizens named him Principe (Prince) and Pater Patriae (Father of the Homeland).Befitting his unique status in Genoa, Doria built himself a splendid seaside villa just outside the city's western gate (Villa Doria or Palazzo del Principe). He entrusted the design and the decoration of much of this complex to Perino del Vaga, one of Raphael's students. Perino was responsible for the entire decoration of the Salone dei Giganti.

12568-2empero2.jpg	"D�rer had originally planned the two imperial portraits of Charlemagne (also in Nuremberg) and Sigismund to be a foldable diptych. In accordance with the prescriptions of the Nuremberg town council, who had commissioned the works, the two portraits were supposed to be based on the paintings which had previously decorated the ""Heiltumskammer"" in the Schoppersche House by the marketplace, where every year the state jewels were kept for a short time. Emperor Sigismund is turned towards Charlemagne. The portrait, which is rather wooden in appearance when compared to other portraits by D�rer, presumably was based on a miniature copy in a portrait book by Hieronimus Beck of Leopoldsdorf, which is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

37396-portrait.jpg	Michel Sittow was an artist from Reval (Tallinn) who did enjoy his own career and who probably learned his trade from Memling, though he never registered as his pupil. We know from the records of a legal case he brought in L�beck against his stepfather that he came to Bruges in 1484 to learn the trade of painter, and that his apprenticeship had not ended by 1486. By 1492 he had become court painter to Isabella the Catholic. What few works of his survive owe a compositional and technical debt to Memling. It is possible that Sittow helped Memling carry out the enormous number of commissions he received in the second half of the 1480s. However, very few works of this period can be dated with precision.This bust portrait shows the sitter in three-quarter view to the right against a plain dark green-blue background. Through the slits of a brown tabard can be seen the scarlet sleeves of his jacket, over which are wide dark blue-black revers. Sticking out of this is a short straight black collar which is open above a white shirt. On his head is a dark beret. Previously taken to be a Gossaert, it is now generally attributed to Michel Sittow, which is confirmed by the portrait's Baltic origin. The Mauritshuis portrait is one of those early-sixteenth-century portraits which are very close to Memling. Not only are the general framing of the figure and the green-blue background clearly related; the position of the hands pushed towards the corner of the frame is even identical. Moreover, the type and graphic modelling of the fingers belong to Memling's formal vocabulary

09592-evangel2.jpg	A marked change can be observed in the style of Correggio after 1520 which is apparent in the decorations that he realized in the great Benedictine construction in Parma, the church of San Giovanni Evangelista. There is no doubt that earlier visits to Rome to see Michelangelo's and Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican had an impression on him.The painter was commissioned to decorate the dome with its pendentives, the apse of the main chapel, the candelabrum motifs in the transept over the high altar, and the frieze of the nave.The dome whose vault has no lantern and only receives light from the four oculi set in the drum, was reserved for the illustration of the Passing away of Saint John, the last of the Apostles to die, aged over a hundred, at Ephesus. It is a traditional belief that at the moment of his death Christ came to meet him, surrounded by all Apostles

18544-youngboy.jpg	This portrait sketch of a young boy, head and shoulders, with a white collar is typical of Grimou's artistic output. A pupil of Jean-Fran�ois de Troy, Grimou took from his master a warm palette and added to it an audacity of handling which places him squarely in the 18th century. Often intimate in nature and executed with brushstrokes of a great spontaneity, works like the present clearly provoked the fantasy portraits later sketched by Jean-Honor� Fragonard who, moreover, painted pastiches in Grimou's manner. Grimou's influence can also be discerned in the work of Jean-Baptiste Greuze. Grimou himself sought inspiration from the Dutch Golden Age, with a debt to Rembrandt seen here in the beautifully rendered chiaroscuro

34283-adoratio.jpg	The artist's bold and colourful treatment of the theme (Saint Matthew 2:9-11) is a link in Venetian painting between Paolo Veronese and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The composition is derived in its essentials from the altarpiece painted by Veronese in 1573 for the church of San Silvestro, Venice (now in the National Gallery, London) and anticipates the altarpiece painted by Tiepolo in 1753 for the monastery of Schwarzach in Franconia (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich). All three works are large, but the composition by Tiepolo differs from the others, which are almost square in format, by being compressed into a vertical.The Adoration of the Magi was acquired by George III in 1762 from Consul Joseph Smith and formed part of a series of seven pictures of New Testament subjects. The related paintings are Christ and the Woman who Believed, Christ and the Woman of Samaria, The Magdalen anointing Christ's Feet (all still in the Royal Collection), The Pool of Bethesda and The Woman taken in Adultery (Ministry of Works, presently at Osterley House) and The Sermon on the Mount, which is lost. All these paintings, with the exception of the present work, illustrate scenes from Christ's ministry.The origin of the commission for this series of paintings is unknown. The size of the undertaking (the dimensions in each case are extremely large and there are fundamental changes in format) has caused the series to be associated with an unrecorded commission for the Royal House of Savoy in Turin, for whom Ricci worked during the 1720s.The painting demonstrates Sebastiano Ricc's role in the evolution of Rococo art in Venice, which reached its climax in the work of Tiepolo. The setting of The Adoration of the Magi is dramatic, the brushwork full of verve and panache and the colours bright. Several changes in the composition can be seen with the naked eye, especially in the centre. The artist travelled extensively in Italy and also worked in England from 1711/12 to 1716, returning home via France. He formed a partnership with his nephew, Marco (1676-1730), who, according to Gherardi, painted the architectural background to The Adoration of the Magi and the related pictures

05202-7deadly.jpg	"This is one of Bosch's earliest known works and reflects the style and preoccupation which would later come to be considered characteristic of him. It belonged to Philip II King of Spain, who kept it in his apartments at the monastery of the Escorial.The Seven Deadly Sins is a painted rectangle with a central image of the eye of God with Christ watching the world. The Seven Deadly Sins, depicted through scenes of worldly transgression, are arranged around the circular shape. The circular layout with God in the centre represents God's all seeing eye: No sin goes unnoticed. In the corners of the image appear the ""Four Last Things"" (the last four stages of life) mentioned in late medieval spiritual handbooks: Deathbed, Last Judgment, Heaven, and Hell, all of which are favourite themes of separate Bosch panels.In the centre, fanned out around the figure of Christ, appear seven scenes each illustrating one of the Seven Deadly Sins, bearing the appropriate inscription and composed with the painter's usual vivacity and sense of the fantastic. (1) Anger presents a scene of jealousy and conflict; (2) in Pride, a demon presents a woman with a mirror; (3) in Lust, two sets of lovers speak within the confines of an open tent, entertained by a buffoon, while on the ground outside lie various musical instruments, including a harp which will reappear in the 'Garden of Earthly Delights'; (4) Idleness is represented by a woman dressed up for church and trying to wake a man deep in slumber; (5) Gluttony shows a table spread with food and around it figures eating voraciously; (6) Avarice displays a judge allowing himself to be bribed; and (7) Envy depicts the Flemish proverb 'Two dogs with one bone seldom reach agreement'"

27129-still_1.jpg	Like van Schrieck and Ruysch, Abraham Mignon also composed dioramic situations in the form of forest still-lifes. Set against a dark background without clear spatial delimitations, we can see pedestals and stone plinths building up from the ground. These are covered with an abundance of fruit and vegetables, with delicate stalks of grain winding themselves around pumpkins and corn cobs with blue and yellow kernels. Together with peaches, plums and grapes they combine to form an arrangement which has an affinity to de Heem's religious fruit still-lifes.This painting, too, includes an encoded Christian message. Because of its many seeds and its rapid growth, the pumpkin had been interpreted as a symbol of growing Christian faith since the early Middle Ages. Similar ideas were probably associated - as far as can be determined - with corn cobs and its many kernels, though corn is not mentioned in the Bible. Grapes and corns are well-known references to the Eucharist again. In Mignon's painting the artist arranged the fruit in such a way that it is framed vertically by branches growing upwards from the ground. These branches, which are probably intended to indicate an oak tree, are completely covered with moss and seem almost dried up, though some shoots can be identified which indicate the tree's ability to survive

14974-tahiti20.jpg	In the absence of any remaining native culture in Tahiti, Gauguin gradually began to create a convincing fiction of life in a tropical paradise from an eclectic range of sources. After reading Moerenhout's Voyages aux Iles de Grand Ocean Published in 1892) he constructed some notion of a mythical past, and from a wide selection of photographs and illustrations that he took with him to Tahiti he imposed the cultures of so-called primitive peoples onto Tahitian subject matter in an attempt to make it look authentically 'savage'. In Ta Matete the poses of the figures derive from an Egyptian fresco painting on a Theban tomb that Gauguin had seen in the British Museum. In the work, he has retained the insistent frieze-like composition of his source, observing each of the women full-face or in rigid profile.The work represents the prostitutes who frequented the market place in Papeete, in response to the demands of the colonial population. Gauguin's retention of the hieratic gestures of the original may be an ironic comment on the constrained sexuality of the native Tahitians, forced to pander to a Western audience

38102-stillife.jpg	The most neglected area of French 17th-century painting is that of still-life. It is still sometimes mistakenly assumed that the work of still-life painters was insignificant in their time compared with the grand designs of Claude and Poussin but, with one major exception, all the main still-life painters worked in Paris; they were not provincial artists working in obscurity away from the mainstream of the development of painting.The exception was the obscure S�bastian Stoskopff, whose oeuvre has only recently been reconstructed. He was isolated in Strasbourg, the main town of the province of Alsace, which did not come under French rule until 1648 (although Strasbourg itself was not occupied until 1681). In the Middle Ages the artistic traditions of Alsace had their own flavour, being subjected to influences from central Europe, Italy, and, to a lesser extent, France. Stoskopff, however, was influenced by none of these traditions, being a totally isolated painter working in a style verging on the naive. Influences from such German still-life painters as Georg Flegel are discernible, but they merely be caused by the similarity of subject-matter rather than by any stylistic affinity.Stoskopff art's is unique. One of the best examples of his work is the Still-Life of Glasses in a Basket. The tonality is monochrome, and the glasses in the basket are positioned in disarray. To this day, waitresses in restaurants in the region collect the empty drinking glasses by placing them heaped up in a basket rather than balancing them on a tray.

08083-morn_fog.jpg	Carl Gustav Carus, though fifteen years Friedrich's junior, was a close friend, associate, and in some ways influence. Like Friedrich, he was a friend of Goethe. He was also author of important literature for the Romantic movement and its ethos. Carus, with Friedrich, was keenly interested in Dutch art of the seventeenth century and took over some of its elements. His Foggy Landscape (also known as Morning Fog) has much of the clear-eyed vision of Dutch Baroque art, but it shares the freshness of contemporary works by Constable and Turner. The watercolour medium of this view was ever more popular in the nineteenth century, especially among men and women like Carus who had other careers in addition to painting and needed speedy pictorial results

39423-2martmar.jpg	Jacopo Robusti took his nickname, Tintoretto, from his father's profession of dyer (tintore). Notably devout, he was much in demand as a painter of altarpieces and reli- gious narratives for the churches and confraternities of his native Venice, and also executed many portraits. He modified his style and technique according to the commission. He sometimes deliberately imitated the style of other painters, but his ideal was said to be 'the drawing of Michelangelo and the colouring of Titian'. What is uniquely his own is his sense of drama, often verging on melodrama, expressed through violent movement and vertiginous shifts in scale, as figures plunge towards us or recede abruptly into the distance, and by lurid tonal or colour contrasts

36773-members.jpg	Jan van Scorel's portraits are highly naturalistic and reflect little of the 'modern' manner of his other paintings. While in Haarlem, he created a joint portrait of members of the Brotherhood of Jerusalem Pilgrims. The Brotherhood, founded in 1506, consisted of prominent local men who had made the arduous pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which is depicted in the small painting within the painting held by a servant. This is an early group portrait, a type of painting that grew in popularity in the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Van Scorel sacrificed unified action for a clear presentation of each individual. The twelve gentlemen are arranged, in chronological order of their pilgrimage, two by two, as if in procession. Each holds a palm branch, known as a Jerusalem feather. The Brotherhood's members were responsible each Palm Sunday for escorting a wooden Palmesel, a wheeled statue of Christ riding on an ass, through the streets of Haarlem.Scorel placed the group against a wall. The men's coats-of-arms and mottos appear as if painted on the wooden trim above their heads.The sculpturesque features of each man are carefully recorded. Below, inscribed sheets of paper, rendered in trompe l'oeil, are affixed to a fictive strip of wood. The first lists deceased members of the Brotherhood. The eight-line text beneath each man identifies him, testifies that he visited Christ's grave and offers a supplication or prayer. Later their death dates were added. The third figure from the right, above the detached edge of paper, is the artist dressed as a canon

02507-6elem3.jpg	The painting is one of the series representing the Four Elements. From the series, Fire and Water are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Earth is now in a Viennese private collection. Air has been lost and only exists in copies.The allegory of Fire combines objects that are more or less directly related to fire in a bizarre profile head. The cheek is formed by a large firestone, the neck and chin are formed by a burning candle and an oil lamp, the nose and ear are contoured by firesteels; a blond moustache is formed by a crossed bundle of wood shavings for kindling, the eye is an extinguished candle stub, the forehead area is a wound-up fuse, the hair of the head forms a crown of blazing logs. The breast is composed of fire weapons: mortar and canon barrels together with the respective gunpowder shovel and a pistol barrel.Prominently positioned in the picture is the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, beneath which the imperial double-eagle can be seen: a clear reference to the Habsburg House and the beneficiary of the series, Emperor Maximilian II.

08581-4bather1.jpg	C�zanne painted three large versions of the female bathers, all during the last seven years of his life. The version in Philadelphia is the largest. This was the first time that C�zanne had painted such a monumental canvas. Two other versions are in The Barnes Foundation, Merion, and in the National Gallery, London.The figures in all three compositions are remarkably simply and coarsely painted. The female creatures frolicking on the riverbank are not graceful, rather they are sturdy, angular, oddly proportioned and plump, and have nothing erotic about them. C�zanne avoided any suggestion of individuality and instead has generalised the figures in the same way as the landscapes, so that both have equal artistic weight.The Merion version of the Large Bathers  is said to have taken five years to paint. This is not the result of any uncertainty in its dating, C�zannne really did spend so long painting it. His extremely slow way of working and dissatisfaction with the results of his efforts led him to leave a number of paintings unfinished

08015-charles.jpg	Carre&#241;o was appointed to the rank of court painter in 1671. Once installed as court painter, Carre&#241;o, like his illustrious predecessor Vel�zquez, devoted himself principally to portraiture. The physiognomy of Charles II as not inspiring, it revealed the consequences of six generations of inbreeding. However, Carre&#241;o did his job with skill and dignity. The secret of his success is a compositional format in which the sitters are depicted within a state room in the palace, most frequently the famous Hall of Mirrors. This device allowed the artist to soften the impact of the king's appearance by drawing attention to the surroundings, especially the fascinating reflections of the pictures in the room. As the king aged, he grew inexorably uglier. In this flamboyant portrait of Charles as grandmaster of the Golden Fleece, the disparity between the regal trappings and the lost soul encased within them is profoundly unsettling. The very brilliance of execution only heightens the impression of the king's inadequacy for his lofty office

19834-03deadch.jpg	Portraits apart, this is perhaps Holbein's most striking image. Since Dostoevsky's observations in the nineteenth century, which dwelt on the forbidding aspects of physical decay and bodily corruption, the painting has been seen as the product of a mind steeped in the apocalyptic horrors that were unleashed by the first phase of the Reformation. But what is known of Holbein's phlegmatic interpretation of the human condition belies this interpretation. Modern authorities suggest that Holbein intended to stress the sheer miracle of Resurrection and its imminence, since the minutely-observed level of decay in the gangrenous wounds suggests that we see Christ's body three days after death.An inscription in brush on paper, 'IESUS NAZARENUS REX IUDAEORUM', borne above the painting by angels holding the instruments of the Passion, precludes its use as a predella panel (at the base of an altarpiece), as does our viewpoint of the body. Instead, a role as an object of contemplation, a reminder of Christ's sufferings and mortification and his subsequent triumph, is suggested. Such practices flourished from the late middle ages and account in part for the many representations of the dead Christ from Lombardy (the Bellinis in Venice also produced several). Mantegna's famous version grapples with artistic as well as religious problems in its dramatic foreshortening, which are not fully resolved. By contrast, Holbein's draughtsmanship appears masterly.An unverified tradition asserts that a drowned body fished out of the Rhine served the painter as a model for the figure of Christ lying in the tomb. Even if it is not true, the legend is a telling testament to the terrifying realism of Holbein's depiction of a corpse in a state of rigor mortis

04585-virgin_c.jpg	The refined manner of painting, the pale flesh tones and the powerful colour contrasts make the work a paradigm of classicist painting. It is therefore not surprising that it was attributed to the French artist Simon Vouet from the early 1700s until well into the 20th century. Van Bijlert had lived in Rome from 1621  to 1624, and would certainly have met the celebrated Simon Vouet there. The composition and colours of Van Bijlert's Virgin and Child seem to be strongly influenced by Vouet.

10516-madfranc.jpg	"This majestic Virgin, richly clad in a gold-embroidered mantle, is holding the Child on her knees. The hieratic grandeur emanating from her, augmented by the high-backed throne and the intangible space created by the gold background, is somewhat tempered by the deep gentleness of her face and the delicate gesture of the hands surrounding the Child's body. Emphasis is placed on the hands, full of tenderness in the case of the Virgin, tensed in an elegant gesture of pain in the case of St Francis, who is dressed in the long Franciscan habit which he opens to reveal his stigmata. The uneasy emotion given off by the sculptural silhouette moves beyond formal late Gothic elegance to express the strength of his participation in Christ's sufferings.These two paintings are from a large altarpiece produced by Crivelli in around 1471-72 for the Church of St Francis of Montefiore dell'Aso in the Ancona Marches. The polyptych, now dismantled, originally contained 21 panels organised in three registers. The top register consisted of the Virgin, flanked by St Peter and St Catherine of Alexandria to the left and by St Francis of Assisi and St Mary Magdalen to the right. At the centre of the upper register was a Piet&#224;, surrounded by St Claire, St Louis of Toulouse and two unidentified saints. The praedella was made up of 11 parts representing the apostles. Today, various panels are dispersed amount several museums in Europe, the United States and Honolulu, while some remain in Montefiore dell'Aso, in the church of St Lucia.Born in Venice, Carlo Crivelli settled in the Marches after a period in Dalmatia. There he developed a style of polyptychs constructed on the same model as that of Montefiore, which achieved a real success at a regional level at the end of the 15th century. Whilst his art remains governed by archaising Gothic principles, such as golden backgrounds, verticality and compartmentalised frames, the artist nonetheless developed a ""courtly"" type of beauty, which is brought up-to-date with astonishingly powerful lines. Sharp profiles, vivid and refined colours and a penetrating sense of detail impart an expressive tension to the figures and represent the originality of his work"

23320-3brigid.jpg	The various narrative scenes on the long entrance wall (the south wall), depicted on a large scale in the foreground and a small scale in the landscape beyond, represent episodes from the life of St Brigid, an Irish nun venerated for her charitable activity on behalf of the poor and sick and, most appropriate in the context of the rural community of Trescore, as a protector of crops and farm animals against natural disasters. Thus, in the central section next to and above the doorway, the saint in her distinctive yellow habit is presented four times: in the left foreground she gives food (raw meat, which miraculously has failed to mark her habit) and drink (water miraculously transformed into beer) to two peasant women; to the right, she heals a blind man; in the left background she saves a flock of sheep from a wild boar; and in the right background she halts the advance of a devastating storm			
35685-bentheim.jpg	Jacob van Ruisdael, the greatest of all Dutch seventeenth-century landscape painters, was born in Haarlem. He was a member of a dynasty of artists and was trained in the studios of his father, Isaac Jacobsz. van Ruisdael and his uncle, Salomon van Ruysdael. Salomon worked in the 'monochrome' Haarlem style of which Jan van Goyen and Pieter Molijn were also practitioners, and Jacob's earliest paintings display a powerful debt to his uncle's work.He joined the Haarlem guild in 1648 and two years later travelled with his friend Nicolaes Berchem, a painter of Italianate landscapes, to the German border. There, they visited Bentheim, a small town in Westphalia on the border between the United Provinces and Germany. They both sketched Bentheim Castle and later worked up their drawings into paintings. Indeed Ruisdael, whose imagination was particularly inspired by Bentheim, made a whole series of paintings of the castle perched dramatically on an outcrop of rock. Ruisdael's and Berchem's views of Bentheim provide a fascinating comparison between the two artists and their approach to landscape: whereas in a painting of 1656 (now in Dresden) Berchem turned the castle into a fairy-tale cluster of pinnacles and placed it in the shimmering distance behind a scene of carefree Italian peasants watering their cattle, Ruisdael transformed the low hill on which the castle sits into a sheer cliff, topped by a granite fortress

09481-cain.jpg	This painting illustrates the miserable destiny of Cain, the elder son of Adam and Eve, who after the murder of his younger brother Abel was condemned to perpetual wandering. A haggard Cain is doggedly leading his tribe. On the wooden stretcher carried by his sons sits a bewildered woman with her dazed children. Chunks of bleeding meat are hung on the stretcher. Other men, the hunters, are trudging alongside. One is carrying a young woman in his arms and stray dogs bring up the rear. Fear of Jehovah's sentence is written on every face.  The artist insisted on anatomical accuracy and had live models pose in his studio for each figure.As well as a Biblical story and a grandiloquent epic, the work is an anthropological reconstruction. It introduces a new field - prehistory - at a time when Palaeolithic rock paintings were just being discovered

10213-2nymph2.jpg	"One of Cranach's most consequential pictorial inventions is that of the water nymph. For the first time in painting north of the Alps an artist was depicting female nudes in an open-air setting. In doing so he was drawing on a development which had already began in Italy with Giorgione's Pastoral Concert and Sleeping Venus.The subject of a nude in a landscape was very popular in Cranach's lifetime, and at least fourteen versions from the Cranach workshop survive. The earliest dated example is in Leipzig. A common feature of all versions is the Latin inscription introducing the figure to the viewer: ""I the nymph of the holy spring am resting; do not disturb my sleep."

26146-37frag3.jpg	A number of correspondences, including dimensions, origins and inscriptions prove that the three fragments In Bucharest (the Standing Virgin and Child and the two panels with donors) belong together. They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date. Similar triangular pieces have also been inserted to the left and right of the woman. Like the horizontal strip above the heads in both panels, these additions (to replace damaged or sawn-out sections?) were already present in 1656, when the panels were part of the collection of Leopold Wilhelm

23279-06jerom.jpg	In Venetian Renaissance art, St Jerome was portrayed either seated and reading in his study or kneeling in penitence in the wilderness. Lotto painted at least five depictions of St Jerome and, taken in chronological order, these works show a striking development in his treatment of the theme. Whereas the earliest version of the theme, now in the Louvre, had combined the saint's penitential and contemplative functions, the St Jerome in Castel Sant'Angelomarks a radical change in Lotto's approach to the subject. Jerome here appears twice, in the upper left as a penitent kneeling before a crucifix and beating his breast with a stone, and in the foreground as a scholar seated on a path marked off by a rudimentary fence.The painting is dated to the period of the artist's activity in Rome. The recumbent figure of Jerome can be compared with Raphael's Diogenes, reclining on the steps in the School of Athens

35695-view_am.jpg	The painting is signed at bottom right with monogram.Jacob van Ruisdael followed in the footsteps of his uncle, Salomon, and became a landscape painter; indeed, he was one of the most prolific and important of Dutch landscape painters. His range of subjects was wider than that of his uncle and of Dutch landscape painters in general. He depicted the rather gloomy dunes and flat, green fields as well as towns, forest scenes and waterfalls; he painted a Jewish cemetery on the outskirts of a town, fishing boats at sea, tracts of marshland with trees and views of seaports, always finding the manner most suited to a particular theme, time of day, kind of weather or type of landscape. No other artist has matched the susceptibility with which he interpreted the peculiar atmospheric phenomena of the Netherlands. Unlike the Italian and French landscape painters, Ruisdael followed the practice of Dutch masters in always painting the real inhabitants of a particular landscape - for him the countryside was a setting for human beings, not mythical heroes. The farmsteads nestling among the trees housed Dutch peasants, on the fishing boats Dutch fishermen are seen earning their daily bread, and it is not disguised Greek deities but shepherds who are seen minding the sheep.From 1656 on Ruisdael worked in Amsterdam, and this was the period when he painted the picture in Budapest - a view of the Binnenamstel, with a sandy road meandering by the water's edge, and a rosy church spire, the tower of the Zuiderkerk, rising high above the city

20254-singeri1.jpg	"Singerie is the French word for ""Monkey Trick"". It is a genre depicting monkeys apeing human behaviour, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild satire. Singeries were popular among French artists in the early 18th century, though the term is most usually reserved for a type of decorative painting associated with French Rococo. It originated with the French decorator and designer Jean Berain, who included dressed figures of monkeys in many of his arabesque wall decorations. The emergence of singerie as a distinct genre, however, is usually attributed to the decorator Claude III Audran, who in 1709 painted a large picture of monkeys seated at table for the Ch&#226;teau de Marly. In France the most famous such rococo decor are Christophe Huet's Grande Singerie and Petite Singerie decors at the Ch&#226;teau de Chantilly.The six canvases by Huet, which depict monkeys dressed up as humans and engaged in various country leisure activities, originally formed part of the decor of a salon in the Ch&#226;teau de La Norville. The salon had paneling by the sculptor Nicolas Pineau, which framed the six singeries. In his design, Pineau positioned four of the canvases - The Fishermen, The Dance, The Picnic, and the Concert - as overdoors, while installing the remaining two - The Painter and The Sculptor - above pier glasses"

09033-08seapor.jpg	Claude Lorrain drew the sum of Italian and northern European landscape painting, and on this basis developed the High Baroque ideal landscape par excellence. The secret of the special effect of depth in his paintings lies in his perfection of proportions and perspective. Not even his most talented imitators, of whom there would be myriads in Europe and America in the centuries to come, were able to match it. For all the beauty of his works, however, we should not forget to note their original social function. The palaces of the secular and ecclesiastical elites of the period, not only in Rome, were furnished with an almost unimaginable luxury. The festival held by Philippe d'Aglie in about 1637 in Rivoli, for instance, presented panorama views of the provinces of Savoy Piedmont, Turin and Montferrat, each in its own room. The dining table was mounted on casters and pushed, complete with diners, from room to room. The party banqueted and danced among the landscapes, and as the people (rather than the setting) were portable, they could imagine they were traveling through the countryside.Art formed the setting for a society that reveled in pomp and display. Its tendency to the theatrical is also evident in Claude's paintings. To hold their own in opulent surroundings, they needed effective composition and poetic coloration. This is particularly evident in his stagelike views of harbours, except that they far surpass any theater set in terms of their stupendous effects of illumination and space. Seaport at Sunrise, in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, is a prime example. In the midst of imaginative scenery mundane activities like the transport of bales of goods by boat are, as it were, projected back into the Arcadian idylls of ancient Greece and Rome.This painting is the latest of the three existing versions of the subject

That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Boldini moved to Paris in 1871. He adopted only certain features of French Impressionism, notably the emphasis on plein-air painting. He largely remained a skilful painter of society portraits, something which had been his forte as early as in his Macchiaioli 1860s. In France he relaxed his technique considerably, though to a significant extent he retained the Italian chiaroscuro effects and broad brushwork. Boldini was an acute observer of his fellow beings, and one of his finest works is the virtuoso Portrait of Mlle Lantelme, with its arrestingly bold, unconstrained brush-strokes

07947-romanriv.jpg	"In Renaissance Italy, Venetian painters such as Giorgione, Titian and Lorenzo Lotto infused fresh life into the pastoral, a genre that had come down from antiquity in written sources. These were scenes of rustic life, shepherds and dairymaids sporting in an Arcadian, i.e. paradisal nature, which were perceived as landscapes charged with a compelling atmosphere. Towards the close of the sixteenth century, foreign painters in Italy and Italians such as Annibale Carracci took up traditions of this type and established what became known as the ""ideal landscape."" This trend continued with modifications into the seventeenth century, and reached its zenith in the ""classical"" or ""heroic"" landscapes of two Frenchmen living in Rome, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain"

17778-507goya.jpg	Goya's fame is as ambiguous as his career. A fashionable court painter and society portraitist, once renowned for his designs of light-hearted decorations, he is now celebrated as a passionate denouncer of injustice and the horrors of war. Supreme recorder of his countrymen's diversions, superstitions and travails, he is also the greatest master of private nightmare, expressed above all in the horrific 'Black Paintings' made for his own house. Perhaps the last great artist working in a style associated with 'anciens r�gimes' throughout Europe, he has been called 'the first of the moderns'.A painter rivalling Vel�zquez in the freedom of his brush and his understanding of light and shade, Goya came to be known outside Spain for his engravings, etchings and aquatints, some of the finest ever produced. In a career spanning over sixty years he left some five hundred paintings, most of them still in Spain (where he also executed frescoes), and many more prints and drawings.Do&#241;a Isabel and her husband Don Antonio were close friends of Goya; according to tradition he painted both their portraits during a visit to their home in gratitude for their hospitality. Don Antonio's likeness, formerly in the Jockey Club, Buenos Aires, was subsequently destroyed in a fire.Do&#241;a Isabel wears the dress of a maja - a style originally associated with the demimonde of Madrid, but in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries adopted by ladies of fashion as a token of Spanish patriotism, and also, no doubt, because its black lace mantilla and high waist were madly flattering, as we can see here. The dress justifies the pose, which we know from Flamenco dance: left arm akimbo, torso and head sharply turned in different directions. Perfectly adapted to the half-length format, the protruding right arm and hand providing a stable base for the torso, this pose without the maja connotation would have been unacceptably vulgar in the portrait of a lady. We experience it as wonderfully emancipated.Goya emphasizes Do&#241;a Isabel best features, her eyes and her fresh colouring, without hiding the fleshy nose and slightly underslung jaw; the incipient double chin adds to her youthful charm. Freely painted, the mantilla serves as a dark aureole to her bright face, and tones down the shimmering pink and white bodice in order not to distract from the flesh tones

08724-esther.jpg	Esther, a young Jewess chosen by the Persian king Ahasuerus to be his wife, prepares herself to go to him to plead that he save the Jews of the kingdom whom his grand vizier intends to massacre.The biblical theme serves only a pretext for painting a colourful Oriental scene. In this work Chass�rieau seeks the synthesis between a typical Ingres-style theme and the kind of handling used by Delacroix. Hence his Esther resembles oriental women with the curves and arabesques that his teacher Ingres would have preferred, whereas the fabrics and precious articles are treated in the manner of Delacroix.The painting was one of Chass�riau's masterpieces exhibited at the Salon of 1842

42559-08offic.jpg	"Signature: Not signed.Provenance: This painting seems to be identical with the one listed in the Amsterdam sale of 1696 under no. 11: ""A soldier with a laughing girl, very beautiful, by ditto, fl 44.10."" Subsequently, it appeared at a London sale of 1861 as by Pieter de Hooch, and again under the same attribution at sales in Paris in 1866 and 1881. From there it went, via the collection of Samuel S. Joseph and his widow, to the New York art dealer Knoedler, from whom it was acquired by H. C. Frick in 1911.While painting with a brush loaded with pigments and applying them in a granulous fashion by thick dabs, Vermeer ingeniously develops his mastery as a luminist. The young woman is bathed in light, which streams in through the half open window to the left, and reflects itself from the cream-coloured background that is enhanced to the left by very thin glazes of slightly pinkish tonalities. Her face, exceptionally conveying expression  - joy and laughter - appears framed in a kerchief and the collar of her dress. That part of the figure, especially, reveals itself as a symphony of luminosity, set off by the dark sleeves of the yellow jacket on which glittering highlights dance. In contrast, the soldier in the black hat and red jacket is placed close to the viewer, from whom he turns his back. He is hardly more than a silhouette, but rather overpowering, given the relative importance accorded his bodily appearance.The nearest foreground - the soldier on his chair and the dark-green part of the table cover - are so strongly enhanced that the use of an optical instrument by Vermeer for the structuring of the composition seems indisputable. We have here the typical effect of the inverted telescope: the foreground standing out in the manner of stage scenery, while the figure of the girl recedes into space. On the back of the wall, we find for the first time a map. This element of decoration reappears frequently in the artist's subsequent works"

32818-31anside.jpg	Raphael abandoned every trace of Peruginesque influence in Florence and returned to Umbria in the same year with new pictorial motifs which he was to express in two notable works, the Colonna Altarpiece and, a bit later, the Ansidei Madonna, also known as the Enthroned Madonna with Saints John the Baptist and Nicholas of Bari.The Ansidei altarpiece, of a type known as sacra conversazione (Italian for `holy conversation'), in which the enthroned Virgin and Child and their attendant saints seem to commune together, was commissioned by Bernardino Ansidei for his family chapel in a Perugian church. The chapel was dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Bari, and the bishop saint is shown with his attribute of three golden balls (the origin of pawnbrokers' signs) representing the bags of gold he donated as dowries to three poor girls. John the Baptist, who foretold the coming of Christ and baptised him, wears the camel tunic of his desert sojourn and a crimson prophet's cloak. Instead of his usual reed cross, he holds a wonderfully transparent cross of crystal. Pointing to the Child on the Virgin's lap, he looks up gravely to the Latin inscription above her, `Hail, Mother of Christ'. Beads of scarlet coral, a common charm against evil, the colour of Christ's blood, hang from the canopy. The vaulted niche open onto the luminous Umbrian countryside was designed to seem continuous with the actual architecture of the chapel.The luminous landscape background and the high baldachin remotely recall the art of Piero della Francesca, but the figure types, still vaguely Peruginesque in their contours, are psychologically more complex and structurally more volumetric. The compositional scheme is reduced to a large arch whose central axis is represented by the baldachin. The result is a sense of monumentality and harmonic proportion which were to become constant in Raphael's art.One of the three predella panels for this altarpiece survives and is also in the National Gallery, Saint John the Baptist Preaching, which must have been placed to the left, beneath the figure of the saint. Below the Virgin and Child there was once a scene of the Marriage of the Virgin, and Saint Nicholas saving the Lives of Seafarers originally supported Nicholas's image on the right

03842-134frar.jpg	"The triptych comprising large sections portraying the Madonna and Child Enthroned (in the centre), Saints Nicholas and Peter (on the left) and Saints Mark and Benedict (on the right) is signed and dated on the central panel. The paintings wooden frame is probably designed by Bellini himself in perfect spatial harmony with the painting. Its pilaster strips illusorily support the ceiling of the open space at sides in which the saints are placed. In the centre, the Virgin, raised aloft by the throne, has a lighted golden apsidiole behind her which recreates the same effect as that in the San Giobbe Altarpiece. On the mosaic that covers it a Latin invocation can be read: IANUA CERTA POLI DUC MENTEM DIRIGE VITAM: QUAE PERAGAM COMISSA TUAE SINT OMNIA CURAE (Secure gateway to Heaven, guide my mind, lead my life, may everything I do be entrusted to your care).Although apparently more ""archaic"" in that it once again follows a polyptychal scheme (possibly on the request of the commissioner), in many respects the painting constitute a further evolution of the San Giobbe Altarpiece, of which it is reminiscent in many ways. Extremely similar, for example, is the figure of the enthroned Virgin, immersed in fine golden dust that is contrasted only by the compact blue colour of the mantle, which in some way isolates her in space. But mostly it is the study of light that continues, in favour of which the merely plastic elements lose their importance, while the question of space, despite the limit imposed by the shape of the triptych, is ingeniously resolved, not only by rebuilding within the painting the unity interrupted by the frame, but also by suggesting at the sides a vast perspective depth by means of a thin strip of landscape"

23141-pieta.jpg	Lorenzo di Alessandro da Sanseverino, a painter from the cirle of Girolamo da Camerino, is certainly one of the leading exponents of the art of the Marches, a region whose art we are familiar with in a rather summary way and whose artists have lacked adequate critical appraisal.This Piet&#224; is a lucid work, but one in which the tension characterizing much of Lorenzo's art is barely able to emerge, frozen as it is by an excessive, rather over-sweet sentimentalism and the intensely contorted line

44767-shepher.jpg	In 1638 Zurbar�n received order from the Carthusians of Jerez which consisted principally of two parts: five large and two small canvases for the monumental altarpiece of the church, and eight portraits of distinguished members of the order, accompanied by two images of angels with censers, which were installed in a narrow passageway leading to a small room behind the altar where the host was kept. Four of the major altarpiece paintings depict the Infancy of Christ, and for sheer magnificence of colour and spectacle, they are unsurpassed in the artist's work. One of these paintings is the Adoration of the Magi.This painting is a version of the composition employed by Vel�zquez. Zurbar�n takes this scheme as his point of departure and enriches it by substituting rich colourful costumes for the plain serges worn by the magi of Vel�zquez, although fundamentally the paintings are similar in their use of large figures, the suppression of illusionistic space, and the air of high solemnity

41127-adorati.jpg	The picture is the right-side wing of a triptych (the Ortenberg Altarpiece), the central panel of which represents the Virgin and other members of her family, whilst on the left-hand wing the Nativity is depicted. The relatively large-size work, which used to decorate the high altar of the parish church of Ortenberg, was painted by a master of the Middle Rhineland, who was influenced by the Frech and Italian art of the period. The scene takes place in front of a golden background, in a narrow space, in surroundings which look like stage sets. The Virgin is seated on a red bed on the left in the tiny hut-small in proportion to the size of the figures-in Bethlehem and, holding the naked Infant on her lap. She receives the homage of the Magi who are arriving from the right. Strangely enough, the shed is attached to the dark rocks, whereas on the right it is directly adjacent to a tower in the town. With a na'ive ingenuity the painter represented the hut as if seen from above, while the tower is depicted from a point of view below it. Thus he was able to give the impression that the latter was higher. Without using this solution he would have been obliged to cut the tower into two and could not have shown the characteristic ridge of its roof. Or else, he should not have allowed the hut to reach the frame-and in this case what would have filled up the top left corner of the picture? Evidently it was important for him to fill up the whole surface of the picture. That is why he painted the jug above the bent back of Joseph, who is squatting in the left corner, and this is the purpose, among others, of the little red table and the bread-basket which is hung on the rocky wall.It is with infinite humility and devotion that the two kneeling Magi kiss the hand and the foot of Jesus. As an expression of their veneration they also take off their crown. The one nearer to the spectator puts it on the large table, a round object rather similar to the haloes, as if he were solemnly placing a gift on an altar. This symbolic meaning of the table is perhaps stressed by the bread-basket hung on the wall above the head of Jesus and which refers to the Eucharist.The frame, like a setting of some precious stone or noble metal, encloses the picture and contributes to its markedly sublime and solemn mood. Indeed, the painting is full of representation of fine examples of the goldsmith s art, e.g. the crowns, the gold sword and the huge, heavy haloes which resemble golden dishes, and what is more, the technique of the painting itself has affinities with the work executed by goldsmiths of the period. The silver underpaint of the garments lends a metallic sheen to the translucent, enamel-like top layer of yellowish paint

06985-04rainy.jpg	This painting is more academic than Impressionist in character. It depicts an intersection near the Saint-Lazare railway station with a wide-angle view.The lines of receding perspective in Caillebotte's work can often draw us with a disquieting violence into a picture's spatial depth: his perspective recalls the engineer's drawing board. This is true of his large, atmospheric painting of the Place de l'Europe on a rainy day as well. Renoir was to paint a similar scene some years later, but his canvas presented a graceful throng of beautiful women and children. Caillebotte's painting, by contrast, uses wide, open spaces and figural tensions. His people straightforwardly want to get somewhere. The man in the foreground, so close that he is about to step out of the canvas and has had to be cropped below the knee, has the look of a conqueror, the woman on his arm a companion with the air of an afterthought despite her prettiness

18391-1804grec.jpg	Apostle St John the Evangelist was the son of Zebedee, and brother of James and the presumed author of the fourth gospel and, by tradition, of the Apocalypse. He was one of the first to be called to follow Christ. He appears with Peter and James in the scene of the Transfiguration. At the Last Supper he is shown leaning his head on the breast of Christ, from the tradition that identified him with 'the disciple whom Jesus loved'. The Agony in the Garden shows him asleep with Peter and James, while Christ prays. In one version of the Crucifixion John and the Virgin are seen standing alone at the foot of the cross. He is shown among the figures at the Descent from the Cross, the lamentation (Piet&#224;) that followed and at the Entombment. John appears at the Death of the Virgin and her Assumption because the apocryphal writings on which the scenes are based were ascribed to him. During the apostolic ministry John often accompanied the apostle Peter. He was traditionally identified with John who was exiled to the island of Patmos, where he wrote the book of Revelation. He was believed to have died at Ephesus at a great age.Apostle St John the Evangelist in ArtJohn's attributes are a book or scroll, in allusion to his writings, an eagle which may hold a pen or inkhorn in its beak, a chalice from which a snake emerges, a cauldron and a palm - not the martyr's but one belonging to the Virgin and handed on to John at her death; he holds it only in scenes relating to her. John may be represented in two distinct ways: as the apostle he is young, sometimes rather effeminate and graceful, typically with long, flowing, curly hair, and is beardless; or in complete contrast as the evangelist, he is an aged greybeard. Among his inscriptions the commonest are 'Passus sub Pontio Pilato' - 'He suffered under Pontius Pilate', from the Apostles' Creed; 'In principio erat verbum' - 'In the beginning was the Word' (John 1:1); 'Lignum vitae afferens fructus' - 'The tree of life which yields (twelve crops of) fruit' (Rev. 22:2).The scenes from his life depicted in painting are The martyrdom of St John, St John on the island of Patmos writing the Revelation, The raising of Drusiana, St John changes sticks and stones into gold and jewels, St John drinking from the poisoned chalice, Death and ascension of St John

09791-02view.jpg	The picture shows a view looking toward the altar wall and the north wall with scenes 1-5 of the St Cecilia cycle. The cycle begins to the left of the altar.St Cecilia is one of the most famous Roman saints, although she is purely legendary. She is meant to have lived in the second or more probably the third century, but only appears in the tradition in the fifth and sixth centuries. A young girl of noble background, she was betrothed, in spite  of her vow of chastity, to a noble Roman, Valerius. After the apparition of an angel in the marriage chamber, she converted the young man to Christianity and persuaded both him and his brother, Tibertius, to receive baptism. She then refused to make an offering to the pagan gods and was condemned to be suffocated in a boiler, but was saved by the descent of a refreshing cloud from the sky. She was then taken to be beheaded, but the executioner, even after three violent blows, could not detach her head. She lingered on, mutilated, for three days before expiring.The fresco cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia consists of ten scenes from the legend of Saints Cecilia and Valerian, located on the north (scenes 1-5) and south (scenes 6-10) walls of the Oratory, which is connected by a passageway to the church of San Domenico Maggiore. The cycle, resembling a continuous frieze, is very different from the sort of painting normally found in parish churches. It bears a greater resemblance to the suites of canvases produced for Venetian oratories and assembly rooms.The ten horizontal panels, each filled with life-size figures in the foreground, create the impression of a continuous pictorial narrative, one that is structured but not actually interrupted by the framing pilasters. The continuous background landscapes incorporate scenes from the legend of St Cecilia, a large part of which involves the conversions and martyrdoms of her husband Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. Also depicted are the Roman official Maximus, another convert, and Pope Urban I as the saints' protectors, who are soon afterward martyred themselves.The predominant character of the cycle completely reflects the styles of the two masters who set the tone for the Bolognese school in around 1500, namely Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia. They must be regarded as the ones who devised the St Cecilia cycle, which was ultimately realized by collaborators whose names can no longer be determined with the exception of two panels with the signature of Amico Aspertini. The fact that the first pictures on each wall are by Francia would indicate that he was the supervisor of the project.Three pairs of scenes were executed by Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and Amico Aspertini. The author of the two other pairs are not known, here we present the reproductions of these scenes among the works by Francesco Francia.  The scenes of the cycle are the following:Scene 1: Marriage of Cecilia and Valerian (Francesco Francia)Scene 2: Valerian with Pope Urban (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 3: Valerian is Baptized (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 4: Coronation of Cecilia and Valerian (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 5: Martyrdom of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 6: Burial of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 7: Cecilia Disputing with Almachius (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 8: Martyrdom of St Cecilia (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 9: Cecilia Gives away Her Possessions (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 10: Burial of St Cecilia (Francesco Francia

Ever since that time the Apostle has been venerated by the Spanish people as their patron saint and his memory honoured in numerous works of art.Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, perhaps the most significant of eighteenth-century painters, worked in Spain during the last years of his life, and it had been assumed that during those years he painted this picture - no doubt for an altarpiece. According to the latest research, however, the painting was commissioned by the Spanish Ambassador to London and executed in Venice in 1749-50; it is true that the Venetian chronicler mentions a picture of St George on horseback, but it is not unlikely that an Italian, unfamiliar with Spanish legend, may have misidentified the subject. Because of the monumental simplicity of its composition and its brilliant colour harmony, this work must rank high in the annals of eighteenth-century painting

00673-holyfamy.jpg	In his biography of Andrea del Sarto, Vasari mentions this painting right after a panel of the same subject painted for Zanobi Bracci. The latter picture survives: given to Cardinal Ferdinando de Medici it is now in the Galleria Palatina at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. The picture now in Rome, painted for the same Zanobi, was originally installed in the chapel of the Villa di Rovezzano.Numerous copies of this celebrated work exist. Art historians set the date of the composition at 1528-29, comparing it to the Madonna, St Elizabeth and St John the Baptist that Andrea executed for Ottaviano de' Medici. The figure of St Joseph is clearly related to the Raphaelesque model of the Louvre Sacred Family, once owned by King Fran�ois I

09246-sagradaf.jpg	"In 1683 Coello was rewarded with the appointment of royal painter, and in 1686 he was appointed court painter, filling the vacancy created by the death of Carre&#241;o. In 1685, Coello began his first important painting for the king, known as La Sagrada Forma, a highpoint  in Spanish baroque painting. This large, ambitious work has a complex history which is rooted in the endless political intrigues of the reign.This enormous work, which measures about five by three meters, is in fact a movable screen, which can be lowered by a pulley into the floor below, revealing the miraculous host of Gorkum, the ""Sagrada Forma,"" a monstrance that had shed blood when defiled by the Protestants in 1572. This precious object was transferred to the new altar in El Escorial, set up by the noblemen previously violating the sanctuary of the monastery in search of a refugee hiding there, in an expiatory ceremony held on 19 October 1684 and attended by the king, the offending noblemen, and members of the court, and it is this event represented in Coello's picture.The Sagrada Forma is at once a documentary, a ceremonial group portrait, a religious allegory, and a statement of political propaganda, all conjoined in a masterpiece of illusionistic painting. As a documentary, it records the ceremony of 19 October 1684, when Charles and members of the junta expunged the penalty of excommunication through the prescribed act of penitence. The king kneels sin devotion before the host of Gorkum, which is held by the prior. In the right corner are the offenders; members of the religious community fill the rest of the place, which is depicted with literal accuracy, to the pictures on the wall, the same ones installed by Vel�zquez in the 1650s.The picture was intended to be more than an artistic ""snapshot"" of an important event. It also has an allegorical dimension, which is introduced by the inscription and by the winged personifications that soar in the upper reaches of the high-vaulted room. By inserting this textual and allegorical references Coello sought to shift the focus to an age-old Habsburg theme - the dynasty as the temporal defender of the faith"

11305-407delac.jpg	The number of major paintings that derive from Delacroix's Moroccan notes and sketchbooks is clear proof of the impact of the experience. They include the Jewish Wedding in Morocco, The Fanatics of Tangier and The Sultan of Morocco and his Entourage. In the composition of these works, Delacroix scrupulously observed the notes and sketches that he had made in situ. Thus the decor of the Jewish Wedding in Morocco exactly matches that recorded in a watercolour in the notebook, while his notes give an exact description of the painting that was to come.The Sultan of Morocco and his Entourage was intended to immortalise the Comte de Mornay's diplomatic mission, his successful meeting with the Sultan. In fact, Delacroix scorned the opportunity to commemorate an event doomed to oblivion. Instead, he concentrated on creating a spectacular open-air scene in bright light, with vivid colours and monumental protagonists. Exemplifying his orientalising vein, it also exhibits the full wealth of his technical mastery

44041-2john.jpg	The central panel depicts the Baptism of Christ. The main scene is accompanied by tiny figures in the arch moulding showing the Temptation of Christ and St John the Baptist preaching.In the central scene, Christ, hierarchically the most important figure in the whole altarpiece, is brought as far forward as John the Baptist and the angels by the flatness of the painting, though he should be further back. The overlapping of figures is carefully avoided. Rogier paints an image of Christ, radiant and facing full front, which almost resembles an icon, while the figures to the side are set back from him. John, who is actually leaning to one side like the risen Christ in the right-hand panel of the Miraflores Altarpiece, appears much less three-dimensional than that figure, and his limbs are entirely two-dimensional. However, this attitude illustrates his action symbolically, and he is in harmony with the two-dimensional Christ, framed by the dark river as if in a mandorla

33001-02farnes.jpg	In 1517 Agostino Chigi commissioned Raphael to decorate the ground floor loggia of the villa in which the artist had painted the Galatea five years before. Like the Galatea and the Stufetta, this cycle reflects the cultured atmosphere which flourished in Rome under Julius II and Leo X. The frescoes represent the Story of Psyche, a myth derived from the Golden Ass of Apuleius (2nd century A. D.).According to his commission Raphael was to decorate the large entrance loggia, which communicates between the living-room and garden outside. Raphael approached the highly individual character of the space by treating the roofed building, which is in fact part of the main building, as an open pergola. He developed its structure out of the existing wall divisions, and covered them with magnificent, rampant garlands of fruit. Treating the room as a pergola, he designed the two large ceiling pictures that simulate tapestries stretched across the roof. These huge awnings were painted so ingeniously that we can see the straps holding them in place and the scalloped edges they create by stretching the material.The cycle of pictures appears only on the ceiling. Raphael designed a view out onto a brilliant blue sky, in which half-naked figures - either hovering or standing on clouds - merge into an erotically charged scene. The simulated tapestries depict two scenes: the gods deciding to subject Psyche to various tests, and Psyche holding a magnificent banquet to celebrate her acceptance into the circle of the Immortals. Both scenes were no doubt meant to impress upon guests the cultural attainments of the household. Despite a strong erotic charge, the cycle was meant as an example of virtuous womanhood.Although the preparatory drawings and the general conception of the stories are by Raphael, the bulk of the painting was carried out by his pupils, notably Giovanni da Udine (who painted the rich plant festoons of the frame) with the collaboration of Giulio Romano, Raffaellino del Colle and Gianfrancesco Penni. Pope Leo X liked Giovanni da Udine's garlands so much that he commissioned the painter to decorate the first floor of the loggia in the Vatican with similar floral motifs

13733-1scene.jpg	The expressive idiom, which unites a chilly classicism and a Baroque enthusiasm, is particularly apparent in The Flight of Antenor from Troy, the first scene of the fresco cycle in the transept hall of the villa. The city of Troy, consumed in flames, is depicted in soft focus, against which the profile of the famous wooden horse emerges. This backdrop is contrasted in the foreground by a procession of figures striking detached, almost rigid poses devoid of dramatic tension. Amid the crowd one can make out the figure of Antenor, a vigorous old man. A dog crouching at his feet, symbol of fidelity, its watchful gaze looking beyond the frame. On the left side, porters are waiting to load baggage aboard the departing boats

13145-jupiter.jpg	Adam Elsheimer's early works were still clearly in the tradition of sixteenth-century painting and printmaking; yet at the same time the Flemish landscape painters working in Frankenthal were also an important influence on him. In 1598 he travelled to Venice; from around 1600 he is known to have been in Rome; and in 1606 he was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca in that city, where he was able to explore the works of contemporary artists such as Caravaggio or Paul Bril.From 1606/07 he produced a number of paintings based on episodes from the Metamorphoses by the Roman author Ovid, including the story of Jupiter and Mercury at the House of Philemon and Baucis. Philemon and Baucis was an old couple who, according to Ovid (Met. 8:621-96) once gave hospitality in their humble cottage to two travellers who had been turned away from other, richer houses. During supper, to the hosts' astonishment, the wine bowl miraculously replenished itself; their only goose, which they would have killed for the occasion, flew to the visitors for refuge. Jupiter and Mercury, for it was they, then revealed themselves to Philemon and Baucis, and took them up to the mountainside where they observed that the whole country was covered with flood waters, except for the cottage which had been changed into a temple. Granted a wish by Jupiter, the old man and woman chose to be priests of the temple. At their death they were changed into an oak and a lime tree.In Elsheimer's day, the story would have been read as a parable of divine revelation to humanity, most especially to the poor, and as having strong analogies with Biblical tales. The painter does not show the transformation, but rather concentrates on the hospitality extended to the gods by the married couple, as is described at length in Ovid, and more specifically on the events before the meal. The low door and the cramped space inside the hut, the bed covered with its simple covers, the care and attention showered on the guests - Elsheimer takes all this from Ovid and presents it, enriched by a couple of motifs of his own, to the viewer. Even the goose, which the aged couple intended to slaughter for the wanderers and that was spared at the gods' behest, can be seen in the foreground.By situating the scene indoors, Elsheimer's depiction differs strongly from the admittedly rare earlier examples of this subject. The artificial light sources are given special significance: to the left, an oil lamp brightens the faces of the gods and lends them additional force; to the right, a somewhat weaker light illuminates in particular the still-life in the foreground. In this the picture matches a series of nocturnes that Elsheimer painted during the same period in Rome with the aim of mastering the techniques of Caravaggio.This small cabinet painting, on copper like many of Elsheimer's works, was disseminated in engravings and copies, and even Rembrandt was to draw inspiration from it.

14539-pitti1.jpg	The picture shows the general view looking towards the north and west walls in the Sala Terreno (called the Room of Giovanni da San Giovanni) in the summer quarters of Ferdinando II de' Medici on the ground floor in the Palazzo Pitti.The Palazzo Pitti in Florence, purchased from the Pitti family by the wife of Duke CosimoI de' Medici in 1549 and renovated and expanded by Bartolommeo Ammanati, served as a residence of royal proportions for roughly 350 years. It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno). Its virtuoso wealth of forms, the scenographic bravura of its architectural painting, and its strikingly original programmatic concept, makes the room an outstanding example of seventeenth-century Florentine painting, standing as it does between tradition and modernism. The east wall of the Salone and the ceiling was painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1635-36, the south wall by Cecco Bravo in 1638, the west wall by Ottavio Vannini in 1639-41, and the north wall by Francesco Furini in 1640-42.The wall paintings deal with Lorenzo de' Medici and the return of the Golden Age under his rule

12241-verso.jpg	It is interesting to note the different function of the scenes represented on the two sides of the Maest&#224;. The front side was a devotional image destined for the community of the faithful (which explains its size, clearly visible from every corner of the church), while the back was essentially a narrative cycle intended for the closer observation of the clergy in the sanctuary. The main element of the back consisted of fourteen panels, originally separated by little columns or pilasters (of about 4 cm) which were lost, together with the outside frame, in the dismembering of 1771.Except for the Entry into Jerusalem and the Crucifixion, each panel contains two episodes. The central part of the lower row with the Agony in the Garden and Christ taken Prisoner is twice as wide as the other compartments (but the same as the Crucifixion panel) because the events portrayed are composed of different narrative units.Numerous contrasting theories have been advanced by critics for the order of interpretation, rendered problematical by the variety of New Testament sources drawn on by Duccio. It is certain that the cycle began at the bottom left and ended at the top right, proceeding from left to right first on the lower row and then on the upper

14344-triumph1.jpg	The twenty-five-year old Ottaviano de' Medici, on behalf of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X, commissioned Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio and Pontormo for decorations celebrating the pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, and other family members inside the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521. Pontormo was the only one to have finished his lunette fresco, frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto on the long walls were partially incomplete. The decoration was completed by Alessandro Allori in 1578-82, a commission of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici.The Return of Cicero to Rome by Franciabigio is on one of the long walls of the Salone. The young man, who is being raised up by a group of men excitedly gesturing, is Cicero being borne to the Capitol in triumph by Romans on his return from exile. This scene is an allusion to the exile and return of Cosimo de' Medici the Elder.The strip with the obelisk and rostral column as well as the statue of the river god Tiber and the group of four figures in the right foreground were added later by Alessandro Allori

21153-assumpti.jpg	A notable feature of the painting is its division, both physical and stylistic, into two distinct parts: the lower sphere representing the earth and the upper sphere of the heavenly kingdom. In the lower part, the artist has represented the Apostles grouped around the Virgin's empty tomb. The impulse towards realism is evident in the way in which the artist has attempted to individualize the expressions and poses of each figure, as they show their surprise and awe at the miracle. He also organizes the group around the tomb into a more or less coherent spatial arrangement. The tomb, with its plain classical decoration, and in particular the lid which has fallen into the foreground space, give the scene a sensation of depth and realism, which contains otherwise little to indicate its setting: only a patch of green in the background represents what might be the side of a mountain

00469-venus_a1.jpg	Born in Naples but trained as an artist in Venice, Jacopo Amigoni soon began working in the Rococo style. Like Sebastiano Ricci and Pellegrino he often left Venice to work as one of Europe's foremost cosmopolitan artists, fixing the evanescent rather fragile delicacy of his style in great frescoes and paintings of historical subjects both profane and sacred. Charmingly Rococo in taste are the small canvases too, usually with some mythological or courtly subject. A typical example of this type is the painting of 'Venus and Adonis', executed with arcadian grace in the sharpness of the composition and the clarity and softness of the colours soaked in a jewelled and diaphanous luminosity.The story of Venus and Adonis, which has attracted not only artists but poets, including Shakespeare, tells that Adonis was the offspring of the incestuous union of King Cinyras of Paphos, in Cyprus, with his daughter Myrrha. His beauty was a byword. Venus conceived a helpless passion for him as a result of a chance graze she received from Cupid's arrow (Met. 10:524-559). One day while out hunting Adonis was slain by a wild boar, an accident Venus had always dreaded (Met. 10:708-739). Hearing his dying groans as she flew overhead in her chariot, she came down to aid him but was too late. In the place where the earth was stained with Adonis' blood, anemones sprouted. Artists usually depict two scenes, Amigoni painted both.The first scene is shown on this picture. Adonis, arrow (spear in other versions) in hand and hunting dog (or dogs) straining at the leash, is impatient to be off, while Venus imploringly tries to hold him back

42628-29geogr.jpg	Signature: Signed twice: on the cupboard; and signed and dated 1669 top right. All these inscriptions are dubious.Provenance: This painting and the Astronomer (Louvre, Paris) are probably companion pieces, in spite of the fact that the sitter is looking to the left in both of them. They share the same provenance until 1778. Thus: sale Rotterdam, 1713; sale Amsterdam, 1720; sale Amsterdam, 1729; sale Amsterdam, 1778. After 1778: in 1785, both paintings were brought to Paris by the art dealer Alexandre Joseph Paillet. He intended to sell them to the French king, but was unsuccessful. Sale Amsterdam, 1797; sale Amsterdam, 1803; collection Alexandre Dumont, Cambrai; collection Isaac Pereire, 1866; sale Pereire, Paris, 1872; collection Max Kann, Paris; sale Demidoff, Palais de San Donato, Florence, 1880; sale Ad. Jos. B�sch, Vienna, 1885. There acquired by the museum.In view of the fact that the Astronomer and the Geographer are probably pendants, and are the only works in Vermeer's oeuvre that represent male figures involved in scholarly pursuits, we are treating them conjointly.Until 1778, they remained together. The signatures and dates on both paintings are questionable, but they must have been executed toward the end of the 1660s.None of these paintings appears in the sale of 1696, and were therefore commissioned by a patron who was especially interested in astronomy or the celestial sciences. In both paintings, the references to books, scientific instruments, and, in the portrait of the Astronomer, the celestial globe by Jodocus Hondius, are accurately depicted.The latter painting features on the rear wall a picture representing the scene of the finding of Moses, which has been interpreted as being associated with the advice of divine providence in reaching, in the case of the astronomer, for spiritual guidance.Although farfetched, it is likely that the content of the painting is associated in some way with the meaning of the work. The sea chart on the wall of the Geographer does not have any religious association. It must be remembered that the rise of interest in scientific research at the time, fostered by the newly established University of Leyden, and philosophers like Descartes, did not have any specific religious associations. Quite to the contrary, the aim was to explore the universe, and simultaneously to further Dutch navigation in its conquest of faraway lands.Both paintings, with their interiors of scholarly studios and scientific paraphernalia, award Vermeer the opportunity for lightening effects that envelop the scientists in the mystery of an atmosphere that lifts their occupations into the realm of spirituality

05192-04epipha.jpg	Among the works generally ascribed to Bosch's first period of activity (c. 1470-85) may be included several small biblical scenes: the Epiphany (Adoration of the Magi) in Philadelphia, the Ecce Homo in Frankfurt (with a related version in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts) and an altar wing in Vienna, the Christ Carrying the Cross. Their early date is suggested by their relatively simple compositions and their adherence to traditional compositional types.This early style is especially well exemplified in the charming Epiphany&#171; in Philadelphia. The dignified comportment of the Kings is set off by the impulsive gesture of the Christ Child, while the aged Joseph stands discreetly to one side, removing his hood as if abashed by the presence of the splendidly dressed strangers. From behind the shed two shepherds look on with shy curiosity. At this early date, Bosch's grasp of perspective was apparently none too firm; particularly ambiguous is the spatial relationship of the stable to the figures in the foreground, although the crumbling walls and thatched roof have been painted with a loving attention to detail. In the distance at the upper right can be seen a pasture filled with grazing cattle and the shimmering towers of a city.The Dutch character of this early work is unmistakable. The Epiphany represents a reworking of a composition which had long been used by the Dutch manuscript illuminators

40864-08prince.jpg	In this outstanding example of late Gothic portraiture, the linear patterns, jeweled colours, and lavish ornamentation modeled in low relief served to accentuate the precisely observed profile. The subject is believed to be a Burgundian princess. The general concept of such international-style portraits is derived from antique Roman medals and coins.The noble lady's profile is set off by a neutral, dark background. She wears a dark blue dress with a golden design and decorated with pearls, and a head-dress like a turban. Though her face is depicted in profile, her bust is shown in three-quarter view.At first sight the picture affects us rather by its decorativeness than with the fascination of a portrait. The form of the head is reduced to a flat, decorative area and it is only the remarkable, undulating outline that characterizes the sitter, the face itself being a smooth, almost immaterial surface, which does not convey the creamy complexion of the young woman. Only the curving line of the ear was more emphatically represented by the painter. There is a sharp contrast between this face of intricate contours and smooth surface and the dress, plain in its outlines but rich in design and almost three-dimensional in its decoration, a garment with falling folds and a texture one can almost touch. (However one cannot but notice that the decoration of the dress was more important for the painter than the interpretation of its materiality. This is revealed by the fact that the pattern does not follow the movements of the folds but looks as if it were printed on the flat surface of the picture.) And yet, this drapery, with a wealth of details, allows the likeness to take the leading role because it is dark and does not contrast with the dark background, whereas the pale, almost luminous face does do so. The turban-like head-dress is painted in the same manner as the dress. The round brim turns forward like a reversed image of the line of the domed forehead.Apart from her social status and characteristic profile we hardly know anything about the sitter; nor did the artist aim at revealing more than this. He wanted to record authentically the child of a rich family, an endeavour excellently realized by the characteristic, emblematic profile form framed by the magnificent apparel.The attribution of the picture has been subject to a great many arguments. Some scholars consider it to have been painted by Pisanello, others deem it to be the work of a Franco-Flemish master active in the circle of the Limbourg brothers

42230-0216vela.jpg	Although Vel�zquez enjoyed life in Rome during his first visit to Italy, he feared the summer heat in the city, and consequently in May 1630 withdrew for two months to the secluded Villa Medici, which was also an ideal place for him to pursue his studies of classical antiquity. Here he produced two small landscapes of astonishing originality, which represents aspects of the gardens of the Villa Medici.During the previous decade, a few northern artists in Rome began to draw out of doors, continuing and expanding upon the practice of depicting ancient sites initiated by draftsmen of the sixteenth century. Vel�zquez's little paintings are derived from the plein air drawings of such artists as Paul Bril and Bartolomeus Breenburgh. However, they appear to have been among the first paintings made on site instead of in the studio. Vel�zquez appropriates the allusive technique of drawing to create almost palpable effects of light and atmosphere. Curiously, he was never again to paint a pure landscape, and thus these remarkable pictures can be interpreted as another example of experimental practices undertaken in Rome in order to expand his artistic horizons

03165-stillife.jpg	Barbari was the first Italian Renaissance artist of note to travel to the German and Netherlandish courts. He probably received training with Alvise Vivarini in Venice in the 1490s. His best-known painting is the Still Life with a Dead Partridge of 1504, a trompe l'oeil probably made for one of the palaces of the Saxon dukes.This Still-Life with Partridge, Gauntlet and Bolt of a Crossbow is the earliest independent still-life in the European painting. It is one of those paintings that mislead the unprepared viewer by displaying the wall on which these objects have been hung. It is likely that the painting was cleverly integrated into the room of a hunting lodge where it was intended to provide amusement to the hunting party. Nowadays we would hardly be deceived by such a painting technique. At the time, however, it was radically new and people's habits of perception had been formed by less illusionist paintings. Barbari's still-life is akin to extremely precise studies of nature by contemporary German artists such as D�rer and Lucas Cranach the Elder. It has therefore been suggested that the Italian artist was influenced by D�rer

37532-0view.jpg	The abbey of Monteoliveto Maggiore which stands atop a spur of the Crete Senese, the barren, rocky country southeast of Siena, is one of the most important and best preserved monastic complexes in southern Tuscany. It was founded by the prominent and well-to-do legal scholar Giovanni Tolomei (1272-1348), who resigned his post as podest&#224; of Siena and renounced his worldly interests to take up the life of a hermit. He was joined by two other men from Siena, Ambrogio Piccolomini and Patrizio Patrizi. The three built themselves shelters in this hostile landscape and over the years still others were attracted to the fledgling ascetic community. On March 26, 1319, the Bishop of Arezzo, Guido Tarlati, confirmed the congregation as a new religious order.The abbey is constructed entirely of brick, and comprises a jumble of structures linked by three  inner courtyards, or cloisters, of different sizes and with different functions. The Great Cloister (Chiostro Grande) around which the more important communal spaces are disposed was constructed in stages between 1426 and 1443. The cloister was frescoed by Luca Signorelli with nine scenes on the west side (1497-99) and Sodoma with twenty-eight scenes (1505-08 and after 1513). The fresco cycle is comprised of thirty-six Scenes from the Life of St Benedict; St Benedict Presenting the Rule to the Olivetans; Man of Sorrow; Christ Carrying the Cross.According to the documents the painters worked in a direction contrary to the chronological narrative sequence. This implies that a comprehensive plan for the cycle was being followed from the start. This master plan saw to it that the scenes with the greatest number of figures fell in the corner bays where they could be appreciated from a greater distance.The life of St Benedict is considered as a reflection and ideal of the monastic life. The exemplary nature of the scenes presented in the cloister at Monteoliveto Maggiore gives the impression that they were deliberately selected for their bearing on life within the monastery. Virtually all of the community's activities and concerns are reflected in them. The ultimate textual source for the Benedict cycle was the biography written by Gregory the Great in about 593-94, which tells the story of the important monastic founder in thirty-eight chapter

19428-vanitas.jpg	"The artist belonged to the second generation of the famous dynasty of still-life painters. He spent his youth in Leiden and as demonstrated by this work, he established close connection with the Leiden school of painting.This splendid painting invokes the memory of the golden age of Dutch still-life painting. The sumptuousness of the instruments is especially fascinating. Most prominent among them is the six-stringed, inlaid viola da gamba leaning against the chair, with a lion's head for decoration and an ""S"" shaped sound hole (more characteristic of violin). Next to it on the ground are two types of lutes, a trumpet, a flute and a mandolin; in a chair on the left, a violin, a bagpipe and a small pocket violin.On the table, richly laid with fruits and golden objects, are the traditional symbols of Vanitas. To illustrate the transitoriness of pleasures gained from wealth, plentitude and eating and drinking, there is an up-ended wine jug from which its content have spilled onto the ground, symbolizing that earthly pleasure is short-lived and man will return to dust. In this context the instruments are symbols of physical love. Next to them the painter depicted a snail on the ground. It was generally believed that this animal was born of mud, thus it became the symbol of sin. In contrast, the ivy crawling up the wall in the background promises immortality. The peach, melon and fig, since they are cut open and their seeds are revealed, symbolize reviviscence and resurrection. This image make the message of the painting less somber, although its warning intent is unmistakably recognizable."

25068-lastsupp.jpg	The Master of the Housebook was a witty, animated artist known from a series of courtly sketches. He was possibly active in Bruges, Freiburg, Mainz, and Ulm, where he was in the employ of Emperor Maximilian. A Passion Altar of c. 1475, now divided between Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, and Freiburg im Breisgau, conveys this master's rare gift for humanity, the physiognomies intense but beyond caricature. The Last Supper, part of the Passion Altarpiece, is seen in old-fashioned perspective, with the figures in the foreground smaller than those at the far end of the table. It includes the traditional group of Christ comforting St John, who is so overcome by learning of the Betrayal that he buries his head in Christ's lap. Judas, in the foreground, consoles himself by weighing his purse - payment for the Betrayal

34067-3renoi15.jpg	In 1883, Renoir painted two large dance scenes, Dance in the City, and Dance in the Country, conceived as pendants. Paul Lhote, a friend of the artist, served as the model for the male dancer in both pictures; the figures of the women and the treatment of the background are different.The elegant young woman in Dance in the City is pictured with her partner in a room in which the chic decor is emphasized by the pillar and the large potted plants. The dancer is the 17-year-old Suzanne Valadon, who later became a painter herself. The model posing for Dance in the Country, who gazes smilingly out at the onlooker, is Aline Charigot, who was 18 years Renoir's junior and whom he was to marry in 1890.These two paintings were created during a period in which Renoir started to distance himself from impressionistic paintings in the search for new stylistic media and subject matter. They mark the transition to the painter's final great period of creativity

38708-boy_pipe.jpg	A pleasant-looking young soldier from the military barracks, sword on arm, is lighting his pipe from a candle which he has lifted out of the sconce in front of him. Two bright spheres of light are thrown over his face and shirt. The subject chosen by the artist is so simple, and at first sight so unambitious, that a contemporary viewer accustomed to formulas may well have sought for some abstruse meaning hidden beneath the apparent slightness of the theme. But the work demands no interpretation, only an appreciation of the episode depicted, and this simplicity is of pioneer significance in the development of genre painting. We learn from this picture that in Dutch genre it was not only everyday objects that came to be acceptable as subjects for paintings but also the unconscious and instinctive actions of men and women.Terbrugghen was a Dutch follower of Caravaggio and this is manifested by this painting, too

14323-01view.jpg	The picture shows a view of the long south wall with scenes 6-10 of the St Cecilia cycle. Above the entrance on the west wall is the balcony which abuts the Bentivoglio family chapel in the adjacent church of San Giacomo Maggiore.St Cecilia is one of the most famous Roman saints, although she is purely legendary. She is meant to have lived in the second or more probably the third century, but only appears in the tradition in the fifth and sixth centuries. A young girl of noble background, she was betrothed, in spite  of her vow of chastity, to a noble Roman, Valerius. After the apparition of an angel in the marriage chamber, she converted the young man to Christianity and persuaded both him and his brother, Tibertius, to receive baptism. She then refused to make an offering to the pagan gods and was condemned to be suffocated in a boiler, but was saved by the descent of a refreshing cloud from the sky. She was then taken to be beheaded, but the executioner, even after three violent blows, could not detach her head. She lingered on, mutilated, for three days before expiring.The fresco cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia consists of ten scenes from the legend of Saints Cecilia and Valerian, located on the north (scenes 1-5) and south (scenes 6-10) walls of the Oratory, which is connected by a passageway to the church of San Domenico Maggiore. The cycle, resembling a continuous frieze, is very different from the sort of painting normally found in parish churches. It bears a greater resemblance to the suites of canvases produced for Venetian oratories and assembly rooms.The ten horizontal panels, each filled with life-size figures in the foreground, create the impression of a continuous pictorial narrative, one that is structured but not actually interrupted by the framing pilasters. The continuous background landscapes incorporate scenes from the legend of St Cecilia, a large part of which involves the conversions and martyrdoms of her husband Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. Also depicted are the Roman official Maximus, another convert, and Pope Urban I as the saints' protectors, who are soon afterward martyred themselves.The predominant character of the cycle completely reflects the styles of the two masters who set the tone for the Bolognese school in around 1500, namely Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia. They must be regarded as the ones who devised the St Cecilia cycle, which was ultimately realized by collaborators whose names can no longer be determined with the exception of two panels with the signature of Amico Aspertini. The fact that the first pictures on each wall are by Francia would indicate that he was the supervisor of the project.Three pairs of scenes were executed by Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and Amico Aspertini. The author of the two other pairs are not known, here we present the reproductions of these scenes among the works by Francesco Francia.  The scenes of the cycle are the following:Scene 1: Marriage of Cecilia and Valerian (Francesco Francia)Scene 2: Valerian with Pope Urban (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 3: Valerian is Baptized (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 4: Coronation of Cecilia and Valerian (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 5: Martyrdom of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 6: Burial of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 7: Cecilia Disputing with Almachius (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 8: Martyrdom of St Cecilia (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 9: Cecilia Gives away Her Possessions (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 10: Burial of St Cecilia (Francesco Francia

40858-01nativi.jpg	This small panel originally belonged to a polyptych which was probably conceived as a portable altarpiece or devotional painting, as it could be folded up to a size that would fit readily into a small box or leather pouch. Other panels from the polyptych representing St Christopher and the Resurrection are also in the same museum. The iconography of St Joseph in the Nativity panel is unusual. What we find here is the story of 'Joseph's stockings'. Jesus' father sits at the bottom of the panel, cutting up one of his leggings. Certain Middle Dutch and German Christmas carols tell that the Christ Child was swaddled in cloth cut from this undergarment. Aachen Cathedral once owned a relic said to be 'Joseph's Stockings', which were the subject of intense veneration in around 1400. It is likely, therefore, therefore, that this little panel was produced in the Aachen area (or at least the region between the Meuse and Rhine), probably some time around 1400

28760-41orange.jpg	"William I, Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau (1533-1584) was the main leader of the Dutch revolt against the Spanish that set off the Eighty Years' War and resulted in the formal independence of the United Provinces in 1648.A wealthy nobleman, William originally served at the court of the Spanish regent. Unhappy with the lack of political power for the local nobility and the Spanish persecution of Dutch Protestants, William joined the Dutch uprising and turned against his former masters. The most influential and politically capable of the rebels, he led the Dutch to several military successes in the fight against the Spanish. Declared an outlaw by the Spanish king in 1580, he was assassinated by Balthasar G�rard in Delft at a time when William's popularity was waning.William of Orange is also widely known as William the Silent. There are several explanations for the origin of this nickname. The most common one is that he rarely spoke out clearly on controversial matters at the court or in public, or (by some accounts) even completely avoided speaking about such topics.In the Netherlands, he is also known as the Vader des vaderlands, ""Father of the fatherland"", and the Dutch national anthem, the Wilhelmus, was written in his honour.On Mor's portrait William of Orang-Nassau appears in the armour of a commander in the imperial army of Charles V. His appointment to this post in 1555 was probably the occasion for the painting of the portrait, as that date is shown in a small cartouche in the middle of the richly-worked breastplate. His military appearance is completed by a ceremonial helmet and the commander's baton he carries in his right hand"

14933-6pould03.jpg	In October 1889 Gauguin returned to Le Pouldu, where he stayed at the inn of Marie Henry with Meyer de Haan. Shortly after their arrival, they began to decorate the inn's dining room and this work was one of the panels Gauguin produced. It hung above the entrance doorway with a second version of Bonjour Monsieur Gauguin. The work's decorative purpose meant that Gauguin could capitalize on the heavily stylised forms, bold colours and abstract patterns which he had used in earlier works.The hieratic figure of the woman is a deliberate attempt to make reference to the kind of non-Western art that Gauguin had seen earlier that year at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, where he was particularly influenced by the art in the French colonial section. In fact, the pose of the woman is borrowed from a photograph of the Javanese temple at Borobudur, and was to reappear in later Tahitian works, including Ia Orana Maria which, like the Caribbean Woman with Sunflowers makes no attempt at authenticity but rather combines cultural references in the desire to evoke not so much a pantheistic vision as a deliberately 'savage' and 'primitive' flavour, which Gauguin was increasingly failing to discover in Brittany

18129-entry_ch.jpg	A pupil of Ghirlandaio, Granacci seems precociously to have assimilated ideas from the activity of Michelangelo - who was his friend - although he later fell back more modestly on the monumental breadth of figures in the style of Fra Bartolomeo.

35527-58mythol.jpg	Titian's career as a court painter-at-large provided a model for that of Rubens, who likewise travelled exceptionally widely in the service of an international cast of rulers. During his travels, Rubens not only studied but also made numerous copies of the Titians in the princely collections of Mantua, Madrid and London. Rubens turned to his predecessor for guidance when composing every kind of subject, while at the same time introducing variations on his compositional models. His own version of the Diana and Callisto story of c. 1639, for example,  clearly draws directly on his close study of Titian's Diana pictures when he visited the court of Madrid in 1628-29

07618-70david.jpg	Nobody knows which was Caravaggio's last work. This painting, which was in the collection of Scipione Borghese as early as 1613, has been dated as early as 1605 and as late as 1609-10. Its melancholy would suit the gloomy thoughts of the artist's final years. The subject matter recalls the Beheading of St John the Baptist in Valletta, but this time there is no brilliant colour and, as a small picture, it has an intimacy that was not evident in the grand public work.The boy handles his trophy with disgust. 'In that head [Caravaggio] wished to portray himself and in the boy he portrayed his Caravaggino,' wrote Manilli in 1650. If Goliath's head is indeed Caravaggio's, there is an element of self disgust in this painting. The device recalls the way that Michelangelo, in the Last Judgment for the Sistine Chapel, placed an anguished face with features evidently his own onto the flayed body of St Bartholomew, but Caravaggio's mood is closer to one of despair. As a witness to God's light, Bartholomew takes his seat in heaven: Goliath, God's enemy, is doomed to everlasting night.Dirty silver, black and browns dominate the picture. The light shows David to look like a boy from the street, whose sword has just a drop of blood on it to show that, like Caravaggio once, he knows what it is to have just killed a man. Another drop of blood in the midst of the giant's forehead confirms that he has been felled by a stone.A decade later Cardinal Scipione commissioned a statue of David about to catapult a stone at Goliath. Bernini was far removed from the anxieties of the older master, and saw David's action as joyful and exhilarating, a triumph of the human spirit expressing itself through the athletic exertions of a beautiful human body.

04808-cremona6.jpg	The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht D�rer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy D�rer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.In the scenes of the Birth of Mary and Betrothal of Mary, festive colour dominates both the interior and the temple square, while in the background the dark openings of the fireplace and the gate correspond

40776-17icon.jpg	"This icon, distinguished by the quality of its painting and wealth of detail, is striking not least on account of its oval shape and its gilt Rococo frame. But it is the theme that is really unusual. On the left is a baptismal scene, and on the right a chariot drawn by two horses, and carrying two men in conversation, one of whom has an open book in his lap. Only the golden inscription in Old Church Slavonic top left reveals that it records the event reported in chapter 8, verses 26-39 of the Acts of the Apostles. The saint with the golden halo is Philip, one of the seven deacons of the Jerusalem congregation. In the Byzantine Church he was included among the 70 apostles, but often confused with his namesake, one of the Twelve.Acts reports that on the almost deserted road from Jerusalem to Gaza, Philip met a high-ranking eunuch of the Ethiopian queen. He had been to Jerusalem to pray to the God of Israel, and was now on his way home in a chariot. He was reading aloud the passage in the book of the prophet Isaiah, where it says that ""He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth."" Philip offered to explain the incomprehensible scripture, and preached the gospel of Jesus. When they came to ""a certain water"", the Ethiopian requested to be baptized. They entered the water, and Philip baptized him"

33947-herculet.jpg	Ferdinando Gonzaga (1587-1626), after becoming the sixth duke of Mantua, commissioned new pictorial decoration for the ducal apartments. To decorate the galleries halls of his palace of delights, the duke commissioned Guido Reni to make a cycle of large canvases, which have been identified with the Labours of Hercules, now in the Louvre. The four pictures were made between 1617 and 1620 and without some disputes between the duke and the artist. The series is dedicated to Hercules, who was understood as a champion of physical strength and moral integrity and who was held up by modern princes as a model for the exercise of their political power.The scenes Reni illustrated were the death of Hercules on the funeral pyre; the battle between Hercules and Achelos for the hand of Deianira; the abduction of Deianira by the centaur Nessus; and finally Hercules vanquishing the Hydra, the only canvas that actually represents one of the mythical hero's twelve labours. In each scene the setting is neglected in favour of the monumental representation of the figures, which become the entire focus of the viewer's attention. They derive from the examples of Hellenistic sculpture that Reni would have studied during his time in Rome, and they dominate the picture plane with their powerful anatomies and deliberate gestures

37975-vanitas.jpg	A monochromatic style was practised by a group of artists who had close associations with Leiden and specialized in vanitas still-lifes. Although none of the last named group worked only in Leiden or dedicated themselves exclusively to vanitas pictures, they are usually called the Leiden vanitas painters. Their pictorial arrangements of books and writing materials, rare and precious objects, terrestrial and celestial globes, scientific and musical instruments, pipes, snuffed candles, timepieces, and above all skulls are readily read as symbols of transience and the vanity of all earthly endeavour. Often they continued the old tradition of including appropriate captions or texts on their pictures. The favourite was the admonition from Ecclesiastes I: 'Vanity of vanities; all is Vanity'.Harmen Steenwijck was the leading exponent of this category. Born in Delft, he was a pupil of his uncle David Bailly (1584-1657), a Leiden portraitist who painted a few vanitas still-lifes. Bailly, in turn, studied with Jacques de Gheyn II, whose Vanitas Still-Life of 1603 (New York, Metropolitan Museum) is the earliest existing Dutch painting of the type.In this picture, he adopted a tonal scale, departing from the ashen colour of the skull; the other objects mostly vary between sallow brown and greyish yellow. This tonality brings the still-life close to contemporary tonal landscape

41412-18chape2.jpg	The two frescoes (Crucifixion and The Virgin and Donor) from the oratory of Mocchirolo constitute one of the most interesting and complete examples of the spreading influence of Tuscan art in northern Italy during the late fourteenth century. Count Porro, who commissioned the decoration of the oratory, is shown kneeling before the Madonna in The Virgin and Donor. Controlled and contained in feeling, the dramatic aspects of the tragedy of the Crucifixion are expressed in the noble pathos of the swooning Madonna. To maintain the equilibrium of the composition, the outward movement of her body is countered by the angels in flight and the columnar figure of St John.The modeling of the figures, achieved through gradations of intense colour, complements the measured narrative rhythm. In the portraits of the donors (members of the Porro family) on the walls, and in the figure of St Catherine, the drawing is light and precise. In both paintings the roseate colour is laid on in thin, transparent brushstrokes, and the tenuous compositional connections have an elegant subtlety

12554-7heller.jpg	This altarpiece was commissioned by Jakob Heller (1460-1522), a wealthy merchant, member of the town council, and mayor of Frankfurt, either before or after D�rer's second trip to Italy. Only the central element depicting the Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin was executed by D�rer himself. The altarpiece was destroyed by a fire in the residence of Duke Maximilian of Bavaria in Munich. Fortunately, a copy of the work, executed c. 1614 by Jobst Harrich of Nuremberg (c. 1580-1617) survived.The theme of the assumption and of the coronation of the Madonna was familiar in Nuremberg painting of the fifteenth century. But D�rer gives it a particular Renaissance interpretation. The doubting St Thomas bows over to the inside of the emptied sarcophagus in the foreground and clings to the linens that wrapped the body of the Madonna. He demonstrates the difficulty he has in convincing himself that the assumption is truly happening. His lowered head is painted by D�rer in a sharp foreshortening.The other apostles are standing or kneeling around the sarcophagus. St Peter and St Paul, in the foreground, turn their backs to the observer opening the view onto St Thomas and the landscape behind the group. In the center-ground of the landscape, D�rer stands as usual with the explicative tablet and his gaze fixed straight ahead. The background presses into the far distance, toward a lake enclosed by hills, peppered with buildings. A broad and tranquil landscape contrasts with the monumental, concentrated and restless group of apostles. While the doubting St Thomas is still looking for proof of the Assumption, the other apostles, arranged in an ascending semicircle to the left and right, have already recognized it. In the sky, in a semicircle of clouds, accompanied and held by a flock of cherubs, the Madonna rises toward the Eternal Father and Jesus Christ, as they wait to crown her. The faces and gestures of the men express an endless bewilderment at the sight of the miracle that is unfolding before their eyes. The variety and vigour that distinguishes the apostles, who disagree among themselves, is opposed to the monumentality of the isolated group in the foreground, consisting of the princes of the apostles, St Peter and St Paul. Each detail of the panel - for example, the bare feet of St Peter, precluding a Caravaggio - has been carefully studied. Eighteen preparatory drawings that still exist demonstrate this. They are in pencil on paper, with an azure, green background. The famous Hands in Prayer also is part of these drawings.The entire episode was conceived with an unusual grandiosity and an intimate participation. D�rer expresses this in the vigour of the colours and, most of all, in the spaciousness and wealth of the clothes. It is modeled on a Raphael citation - twelve years his younger - and his Coronation of the Madonna, painted in 1502-03 and ordered by Alessandra degli Oddi for the chapel of the Oddi in the church of Saint Francis in Perugia. In D�rer's panel, everything is more complex and splendid, but the comparison of the two paintings is nonetheless interesting. D�rer had an opportunity to see the Raphaelesque painting while in Italy. If the commission for the painting was assigned him by Jakob Heller before his first trip to Italy, one cannot consider the Raphaelesque echo to be accidental

43986-0crucifi.jpg	A rectangular framework design, not linked to the depiction behind it, occurs in this triptych that has a Crucifixion in the middle. As in the Seven Sacraments Altarpiece, a unified scene, in this case a landscape, links all three panels, while the centre is marked off from the side panels and emphasized. Not only do the gestures of Mary, John, and the grieving angels express strong emotion, so also do the billowing cloak of St John and the ends of Christ's loincloth, which swirl ornamentally in the air, though on the whole the work is less emotional than the Abegg Triptych. The donors, a married couple, have approached the Cross; they are shown on the same scale as the saints, though they are not to be seen as really part of the Crucifixion scene - they are present only in thought, in their prayer and meditation, and are thus on a different plane of reality from the other figures. Their relation to the main scene is like that of the Christian believer to the image before which he or she kneels devoutly.The Crucifixion Triptych, like the Seven Sacraments Altarpiece, is impressive in its composition. The two are linked not only by the use of a painted golden frame structure in the picture (not found, or not yet found, in any other surviving works by Rogier), but also in the style of the underdrawing. Both works may have been created at roughly the same time, and the dating of the triptych to around 1445, on dendrochronological evidence, would support that theory. Certainly the designs of both pictures derive from Rogier himself, but his assistants seem to have been involved in the execution, and perhaps did some of the preparatory underdrawing as well. The figures of the triptych are executed to a very high standard. However, they seem more abstract and graphic and less three-dimensional than those in the great Deposition (Prado, Madrid), the Madonna in Red (Prado, Madrid), and the Miraflores Altarpiece (Staatliche Museen, Berlin). There is less play of light and shade, and although the landscape is crisscrossed by many rocky crevices and paths, it seems rather empty. Not a single blade of grass enlivens the foreground, and the view into the distance, with the town, also seems dry and lacking in atmosphere, in marked contrast to the artist's other landscapes

04075-rest_fli.jpg	The early sixteenth century saw the establishment in Antwerp and Brussels of a new, modish style of Mannerism that broke radically from the serenity that had characterized the previous century. In Bruges, by contrast, a traditional undercurrent survived. The 'Bruges style' was greatly influenced by Gerard David and dominated by two of his pupils, Adriaan Isenbrant (c. 1490-1551) and Ambrosius Benson, both of whom remained active until about 1550. The sfumato technique employed by Isenbrant and the dramatic colour contrasts used by Benson owe much to Italian influence. What is typical about these two painters is the way they grafted their innovations onto old compositional and iconographical schemes, especially those of a religious nature. In the secular field, the Lombard immigrant Benson was already clearly a Renaissance painter.The very traditional Rest on the Flight into Egypt was the central panel of a triptych.

39600-1mark.jpg	This painting, one of Titian's youthful works, was probably created either during or shortly after the horrific outbreak of the plague in 1510 for the church of Santo Spirito in Isola to celebrate the end of the plague. (It is now in the sacristy of the Santa Maria della Salute.) Here the four saints who are traditionally invoked for protection from the plague - Saints Cosmas and Damian to the left, Roch and Sebastian to the right - are placed in pairs on each side of the altar where saint Mark, patron saint of Venice, is seated.The altarpiece reflects the influence of Giovanni Bellini. However, the figure of St Mark is inspired by the enthroned monarch  in Sebastiano del Piombo's Judgment of Solomon, while St Sebastian on the right derives from the same saint on a series of organ shutters painted by Sebastiano for the Venetian church of San Bartolomeo di Rialto.A new stylistic direction is evident in the way Titian paints the four standing saints. They have a classical nobility of form and a hieratic air which points to the influence of Bellini. On the other  hand, the saints on the left - certainly portraits - are given a very realistic sense of individuality which is in strong contrast with the almost Giorgionesque reserve of the figures to the right.This altarpiece is a brilliantly coloured, luminous work. An unusual feature is the cloud that casts its shadow over the face of St Mark

28363-1market.jpg	In French painting, the 1630s saw the development of the one unexpected genius of the period, Louise Moillon. Her long career was spent entirely in Paris, and enough of her work survives to justify her being placed among the greatest of all still-life painters. Inevitably this claim will be challenged by those who do not accept that genius can exist outside the grand manner of painting but, in the context of the art of depicting fruit and vegetables, Moillon had few superiors.Certain influences can be detected in Moillon's art, but these are superficial. A few of her genre pictures are of the type reflected in the market scenes painted in Antwerp at the end of the sixteenth century by Joachim Beuckelaer, but Moillon's market scenes owe a debt to Antwerp only in subject-matter. The Market Scene with a Pick-pocket was recently discovered in a London private collection. In many of the Antwerp pictures, the humble activity of vegetable selling was transformed into a religious theme by smell scenes in the background such as Christ in the house of Martha and Mary, always a popular addition because it could be classed as 'genre'. In Moillon's work there is no such concession. Instead, in the London picture, the artist reveals her modernity by telling an anecdote: a prosperous housewife buys fruit and vegetables, while an urchin picks her pocket; the vegetable seller likely to be part of the plot. The whole unfortunate scene is painted with a complete sense of detachment, producing a snapshot effect rather than an elaborately posed and worked-out theme. The figures are observed as if they were part of the still-life themselves. Each still-life element in the picture is painted with enormous skill: the bloom on the fruit is beautifully recorded. Each object has an almost surreal isolation (similar to that in the celebrated Still-Life by her contemporary, the Spanish painter Zurbar�n, in the Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena)

His particular appeal in the eyes of an English public lay in the fact that he did not use the historical situation to magnify the dignity of the sitter to the point of heroism, and did not stylise the figure of the colonel into a monumental bearer of history.Colonel Johnson is shown in a relaxed pose, with an Indian cloak draped over his uniform and moccasins on his feet. Behind him, in the half shadow, stands an Indian chief who is smiling down on the seated man and pointing out, with a gesture of his left hand, the peaceful existence of his tribe, visible in the background. The fresh, clear face of the colonel, the Indian attributes and the chief himself all suggest a love of liberty without violence, and a sense of honest and egalitarian cooperation

43757-01theafr.jpg	In 1734 the French Comedy and the Italian Comedy were reproduced as copper engravings by C. N. Cochin. He named them respectively 'L'Amour au th�&#226;tre fran�ais' and 'L'Amour au th�&#226;tre italien', thus making the artist's intentions clear.A shepherd and shepherdess in a park, surrounded by a company of people, form the focal point of the French Comedy. Bacchus is reclining on a stone bench, drinking to a huntsman, while musicians provide music for the dance. One must not assume that Watteau had any particular play in mind; he was probably aiming to portray the various characters of the Comedy. This does not mean that he never depicted real people or happenings; at all events he will have taken for granted that the observer or his patron would be able to recognize such details. The gentleman in black on the right is in all probability the well-known actor Paul Poisson.The theatre plays an important part in Watteau's art. His teacher Gillot, with whom the twenty-year-old Flemish-born painter began his work in Paris, appears to have encouraged this interest in the theatre. Watteau's most famous portrait, the Gilles in the Louvre, is the portrayal of a stage character. Stage-play and reality are strangely interwoven, as they are also in his pictures of social occasions, the f&#234;tes galantes, which Watteau originated and executed with such artistry. These gained for him recognition by the French Academy.There is documentary evidence to show that, from 1769 onwards, this painting and its counterpart, the Italian Comedy, were in the picture gallery at Sanssouci, having previously formed part of the Henri de Rosnel Collection. The founders of the Berlin Museum, however, steeped as they were in the tradition of Goethe and Winckelmann, had no time for Watteau's art, despising its frivolity. The outstanding collection of the works of French painters that Frederick the Great had built up in Potsdam remained almost untouched when pictures were selected for the Berlin Gallery in 1830. Only two paintings by Watteau, which happened to be the smallest, met with the Commission's approval and were accepted for the Museum: The French Comedy and The Italian Comedy. The Enseigne de Gersaint, at that time only a few steps away in the Berlin Palace, was completely ignored.

15215-joseph.jpg	Charles I's success in attracting Northern European painters like Rubens and Van Dyck was not matched in the field of Italian painting. The question of inviting an Italian painter was complicated primarily by the political circumstances and by religious principles. Efforts were made, for example, to attract Guercino and Albani to the English court, but the former declined on the basis that England was officially a Protestant country and that the climate was too inclement, and negotiations with the latter came to nothing. Indeed, a similar situation pertained during the reign of Charles II when the only Italian artist at court was Guercino's nephew, Benedetto Gennari, an inferior painter who worked in England from 1674. Significantly, when Orazio Gentileschi came to England in 1626 his main employer seems to have been Charles I's wife, Henrietta Maria, the daughter of Marie de' Medici, who continued to profess her Catholic faith after her marriage in 1625. For the queen Gentileschi painted the ceiling of the Great Hall in The Queen's House at Greenwich - Allegory of Peace and the Arts under the English Crown (now in Marlborough House, London) - and other important pictures by him are recorded at Greenwich such as The Finding of Moses (given by Charles I to Philip IV of Spain in 1633) and Joseph and Potiphar's Wife. This last, although sold after the king's execution in 1649, was recovered for the Royal Collection at the time of the Restoration and sent to Henrietta Maria in exile in France at Colombes.Gentileschi was born in Pisa, but early in life (1576-78) settled in Rome, where his style reflects the influence of a residual Mannerism that was soon to be swept away by the impact of Caravaggio. The artist left Rome for good at the beginning of the 1620s and is then recorded in Genoa in 1623 before moving northwards to Paris in 1624 and finally to England, where at first he worked for the Duke of Buckingham. Following Buckingham's assassination in 1628, Gentileschi became a fully-fledged court painter, indulging in diplomatic missions as well as painting. His presence in England was not widely welcomed and by 1633 he was trying to return to Florence, reminding the Grand Duke Ferdinand II in a letter that he had been out of Tuscany for fifty-five years. In spite of these efforts Gentileschi died in London.The artist's work has only recently become the subject of close study. To a certain extent his paintings are self-consciously grand and display poor draughtsmanship.Furthermore, the large scale that he so often favoured encouraged a rhetorical flourish that sometimes amounts to vacuousness. Yet many of his compositions are striking and linger in the memory - Young Woman playing a Lute (Washington, National Gallery of Art), The Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery), Lot and his Daughters (Berlin, Gem&#228;ldegalerie) or The Annunciation (Turin, Galleria Sabauda). His style would seem to be based on a fusion between the realism of Caravaggio and the clarity of exposition demanded by the Counter-Reformation. It has also been argued that paintings like Joseph and Potiphar's Wife should be seen in the context of Caroline court art. The predilection for simplified, dramatic compositions and exaggerated gesture, together with the sharp contrast between exposed flesh and the texture of draperies, are paralleled in the plots of contemporary masques and poetry. Within court circles narrative pictures of this sort were possibly the province of Gentileschi, while Van Dyck concentrated at first on portraiture.The story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, which was popular in Florentine art of the early seventeenth century, is recounted in Genesis 39: 7-20. Potiphar was an Egyptian official ('captain of the body-guard') who bought Joseph from the Midianites. His wife found Joseph attractive, and after he was made comptroller of Potiphar's household she attempted to compromise Joseph but without success. 'And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hands, and fled, and got him out.' Joseph was falsely accused on the basis of the garment and eventually imprisoned. The painting exhibits the strengths and weaknesses of Gentileschi's art in that the artist recognises the dramatic potential of the scene, but cannot quite sustain it on this large scale. Interestingly, a replica (New York, Paul Drey) which is smaller in size, is in the final analysis more compelling. On the other hand, the poses of the two figures, the handling of the draperies and the rich colours are memorable.The painting is signed on the back of the original canvas: HORATIUS GENTILESCVs / FECIT. It was cleaned in 1978-80.

24662-vir_dolo.jpg	Within a frame decorated with metal rosettes a tall angel stands behind the half length figure of the suffering Christ and supports Him, in front of a golden background. The figure of Christ is the more moving because, apparently, He is still alive. He looks at us with a tormented glance, but His right hand, cramped by excruciating pain, is too weak to grasp the scourge. Two angels kneeling behind the frame support His hands from beneath, at the same time holding the instruments with which He has been tortured. As these angels are smaller than the other two figures, symbolism and realism are strangely mixed in the representation of the instruments of torture: although they only indicate, on a miniature scale, the dramatic episodes of the Passion, the little angels appear to sink under their burden.The six black wings of the three angels surround the figure of Christ like signs of mourning. The many contrasts in the representation of Christ and the angels lend a singular fascination to the picture. The smaller angels, depicted in multicolour, animated curves, are trying to hold up the ashen, collapsing body which is rigidly angular. The contrast between the faces of Christ and the angel looking out from behind Him is enchantingly lovely. Because of the fact that Christ's body covers the angel's the two heads appear as if they belonged to the same body but had moved slightly. The angel's glance is animated, that of Christ tired; the complexion of the former is rosy, his blond hair curled in rich locks, the latter is pale and His straight brown hair is matted. The contrast between the two heads is continued along the two sides of the composition. On the right-hand side we can see enclosed parallel outlines merging into each other, whereas the left side is characterized by more open and restless intersecting forms. There is a contrast even between the ways the hair of Christ is represented on either side.The fascination of the picture is further intensified by the fact that the figures and objects represented with a host of details in an almost tangible manner appear in completely abstract space. Though farthest from the spectator, the cross seems to be near, because even the veins of the wood can be seen; nails are jutting forward from the two ends of its cross-beam. It is due to this illusion that the figures look as if they were pressed into a very narrow space, close to the viewer

38837-1view.jpg	Giovanni Poggi (1493-1556) was a papal diplomat and financier to the Curia under Clement VII and Paul III. He was named Bishop of Tropea in 1540 and cardinal in 1551. From 1549 he was responsible for the continuation of constructing and furbishing the family palace in Bologna.In the palace, Poggi had the halls of the piano nobile painted by Niccol&#242; dell'Abate, Prospero Fontana, and others. They painted friezes with landscapes and grotesques, as well as numerous episodes from the Old Testament. In the ground floor, the twenty-three-year-old Pellegrino Tibaldi created the Odysseus frescoes, a major work that he would never again equal, one which even Annibale Carracci would decisively fall back upon as a model at the end of the sixteenth century.Tibaldi's frescoes, depicting the Adventures of Odysseus, were created in 1550-51. Poggi must have been satisfied with the decoration, since shortly thereafter he also commissioned the artist to paint his newly built family chapel in Bologna's San Giacomo Maggiore. Tibaldi adorned the chapel with scenes from the life of Poggi's name saint, John the Baptist.The Odysseus frescoes adorn the vaults of two rooms. From the entry corridor of the palace one walks first into a large hall (Sala di Ulisse), where the cycle begins. One finds the continuation and conclusion in a smaller room directly adjoining the hall (Stanza di Ulisse). The ceiling articulation and the arrangement of the paintings in both rooms are oriented along the lines of a famous Roman model, Raphael's Logge in the Vatican Palace. The scenes are inserted as 'quadri riportati' (framed paintings that are seen in a normal perspective and painted into a fresco). Between the fields of the painted histories, illusionistic views open onto colonnades that seem to reach up to the heaven. The framings are executed in stucco.With their various decorative systems, each of the two rooms achieves a wholly individual character, one corresponding to its respective size and position.The ceiling in the Sala di Ulisse contains five scenes from the Adventures of Odysseus, namely1. Blinding of Polyphemus2. Polyphemus and the Flight of the Greeks3. Aelos Gives Odysseus the Bag of Winds4. Neptune and the Ship of Odysseus5. Odysseus and Circ

30976-thepinch.jpg	The Pinch of Snuff belongs to the group of extremely realistic genre paintings which Pianca executed in the mid-18th century. In the decades straddling the 17th and 18th centuries, painters such as Bernhard Keil, Giacomo Francesco Cipper, Giacomo Ceruti, and others used amusement and curiosity to depict wretches and beggars, peasants with ruined hands or tables laden with simple foods, and without overly intellectualising the subjects.

24092-1deadchr.jpg	"The dating of the painting is debated, there are several assumptions ranging from the end of the Paduan period of the artist (c. 1457) to 1501. The most remarkable aspect of the painting is the perspective construction whereby the image of the Redeemer appears to ""follow"" the spectator around the room through the use of an illusionistic technique.In a letter written on October 2, 1506 to the Duke of Mantua, Ludovico Mantegna mentioned a ""Christ in foreshortening"" among the works left by his father. It probably dates to the 1470s. In that case it must have remained in Mantegna's studio for a long time, and may have been intended for his funeral. In fact it was shown at the head of his catafalque when he died. Subsequently it was acquired by Cardinal Sigismondo Gonzaga, and it entered the Brera in 1824.It is typical of Mantegna's art that the simple window-like framing of the confined space in this painting architecturally defines it as the cold and dismal cell of a morgue. Looking in we see an almost monstrous spectacle: a heavy corpse, seemingly swollen by the exaggerated foreshortening. At the front are two enormous feet with holes in them; on the left, some tear-stained, staring masks. But another look dissipates the initial shock, and a rational system can be discerned under the subdued light. The face of Christ, like the other faces, is seamed by wrinkles, which harmonize with the watery satin of the pinkish pillow, the pale granulations of the marble slab and the veined onyx of the ointment jar. The damp folds of the shroud emphasize the folds in the tight skin, which is like torn parchment around the dry wounds. All these lines are echoed in the wild waves of the hair.Mantegna's realism prevails over any esthetic indulgence that might result from an over-refined lingering over the material aspects of his subject. His realism is in turn dominated by an exalted poetic feeling for suffering and Christian resignation. Mantegna's creative power lies in his own interpretation of the ""historic,"" his feeling for spectacle on a small as well as a large scale. Beyond his apparent coldness and studied detachment, Mantegna's feelings are those of a historian, and like all great historians he is full of humanity. He has a tragic sense of the history and destiny of man, and of the problems of good and evil, life and death"

29992-misselut.jpg	Louis XV was addicted to hunting. He and his courtiers indulged in the sport in the forests of the various estates around Paris that made up the royal domains, the most prominent among them being Versailles, Marly, Choisy, La Muette, Saint-Germain, and Compi�gne. Certain rooms of these residences were decorated with painting of animal subjects, hunt scenes, and still-lifes with dead game. The king's hunting retinue, stables, and kennels were an important part of his household. Their staff managed the packs of boisterous, often frenzied dogs that pursued large prey or sniffed out wild birds and other small game. These animals bore such amusing names as Misse, Turlu, Luttine, etc.In 1725 the king commissioned Oudry to immortalize some of his favourite dogs in a series of paintings meant to serve as overdoor decorations for his apartments in the Ch&#226;teau de Compi�gne, located north of Paris. The painter was to portray these animals posing sedately, pointing game, or striding across a landscape. By 1732, Oudry had completed his series of eight canine portraits to which Misse and Luttine probably belonged

07523-26conta.jpg	In 1565 the French Monsignor Matteo Contarelli acquired a chapel in San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, but when he died twenty years later it had not yet been decorated. The executor of his will, Virgilio Crescenzi, and later his son, Giacomo, undertook the task. The decorative scheme called for a statue of St Matthew and the Angel, commissioned first to Gerolamo Muziano, and then to the Flemish sculptor Cobaert, for the high altar; and for a fresco cycle for the walls and ceiling by Cavalier d'Arpino. The latter decorated the vault in 1591-93, but the walls were left bare (this may reflect at least in part the Crescenzis' intentions to speculate on the interest on the Contarelli estate). On 13 June 1599 a contract was stipulated before a notary by which Caravaggio undertook to execute two paintings for the lateral walls, for which he was paid the following year (1600), after the paintings had been set in place. Later, on 7 February 1602, after Cobaert's statue had been judged unsatisfactory, an altarpiece was entrusted to Caravaggio in a separate contract that called for delivery of the work by 32 May, the Feast of the Pentecost. This painting was rejected, the artist made another one (which was accepted) in a surprisingly brief time, receiving payment for this second work on 22 September.The first version of the St Matthew and the Angel was purchased by Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani and then ended up in Berlin, where it was destroyed in the Second World War. The second version (this picture) still stands over the altar today.The first version was a masterpiece of the artist. It contained, in the angel who with gentle indulgence guided the saint's uncertain hand as he wrote, one of the most charming figures ever painted by the artist. The first painting was criticised for Matthew's lack of decorum. In the final version, likewise a splendid feat of imagination but certainly less fascinating than the first, the angel much more correctly counts on his fingers, in the traditional scholastic fashion, the arguments than the saint should take note of and develop. A whirlwind of drapery envelops the angel. The saint balances on his bench, in precarious equilibrium, like a modern schoolboy; but this time the unorthodox elements do not seem to have raised particular objections

07127-2kitchen.jpg	Occasionally it is hard to distinguish market scenes from the genre of early kitchen scenes which also tended to display still-life features. Similar to the market stall, they often show tables and sideboards with clusters of baskets and bowls full of fruit and vegetables.Yet despite structural similarities there are still differences with regard to the subject. While market stalls illustrate the commercialisation of agriculture and the principle of agro-economic production, kitchen and pantry paintings are dominated by the aspect of satisfying the needs of domestic economy, usually in a feudal or re-feudalized upper middle class household. Leaving aside the fact that these paintings grossly exaggerate the wealth of the day, the ostentatious display of the fruit of the earth proves that the principles of the 'paterfamilias' literature were observed even in the non-market-oriented system of domestic self-supply. These principles demanded an improved utilization of the soil by extending the agricultural acreage and intensifying agriculture, as well as by improving crop sequences and fertilization and, in part, by transforming ploughed fields into gardens.The subject of food supply was particularly interest to those who commissioned and bought these paintings. The production and preparation of food were the most important economic problems of society, which explains their central position in contemporary iconography

Among the portraits Filippino has included in his fresco, the most interesting are the following: a selfportrait (the first figure to the left, looking towards the spectator); the first man to the right of the three men standing between St Peter and Nero is Antonio del Pollaiolo, while the one to the left is probably Raggio, a merchant's broker mentioned by Vasari, and not Botticelli as had been suggested previously; whereas in the group of three to the right in the Crucifixion of Peter, the man looking towards the audience is probably Botticelli

05447-20adorat.jpg	Somewhere around 1475, Botticelli painted the famous Adoration of the Magi for Guasparre di Zanobi del Lama, a work in which the artist also depicted himself. This painting established Botticelli's fame in Florence, and may rightfully be considered the high point of his early artistic output.Guasparre del Lama was a parvenu from the humblest background with a dubious past - he had been convicted of the embezzlement of public funds in 1447. He had been working since the 1450s as a broker and money-changer, something which brought him considerable wealth. In order that he might also obtain the high social standing which he lacked, he enrolled in the most prestigious brotherhoods and endowed a chapel in Santa Maria Novella, which he decorated with Botticelli's altar-piece. Del Lama's career did not last long, for he soon slipped back into his dishonest business practices.Del Lama may be seen among the crowd of people on the right-hand side of the picture, an elderly man with white hair and a light blue robe looking at the observer and pointing in the latter's direction with his right hand. The most famous members of the Medici family are portrayed together with del Lama; controversy rages as to their precise identification, although there is no doubt that the eldest king, kneeling before the Virgin and the Christ Child, is a representation of Cosimo the Elder, founder in the 1430s of what would be dynastic rule by the Medici family over Florence for many years to come. Other members: Cosimo's son Piero, called the Gouty, as the kneeling king with red mantle in the centre, Lorenzo the Magnificent as the young man at his right, in profile, with a black and red mantle.A comparison of Botticelli's painting with his earlier representations of the Adoration (both in the National Gallery, London)) reveals the extent to which the artist had further developed and compensated for his earlier weaknesses. The ground rises gently, so that the faces of almost everyone present can be seen, as can the great variety of postures and gestures that these figures embody. However, Botticelli has combined those involved in an ever more compelling fashion to create a dramatic unity, one concentrated wholly upon the main event. Furthermore, he has moved the central king slightly away from the main axis, enabling the observer's gaze to fall unimpeded upon the Virgin, who is now no longer in danger of becoming lost in the throng, as was still the case in the London portrayal.

42986-3love1.jpg	This canvas is one of a series of four evidently representing various attributes of love, or perhaps different stages of love culminating in happy union. They were clearly designed as compartments of a decorated ceiling and might conceivably relate to a nuptial bedchamber. Veronese used this type of 'oblique perspective' for ceiling decorations in Venice: the angle of foreshortening corresponds to a viewpoint obliquely beneath the painting, avoiding the extreme distortion of figures imagined as directly above the viewer's head. By 1637 the four allegories, now all in the National Gallery, were recorded in the collection at Prague of the Emperor Rudolph II, the great art patron of his age, who probably commissioned them.The appearance of all four paintings has been badly affected by the irreversible discoloration of the smalt - a comparatively cheap blue pigment made from pulverised glass coloured with cobalt oxide - used to paint the sky, which now gives it a pale grey tinge instead of its original warm blue. With age, some of the green copper resinates of the foliage have oxidised to brown. In most respects this is the best preserved of the four pictures, and the one where Veronese's own hand, as opposed to his workshop assistants', is most visible

33012-13farnes.jpg	Raphael's pictorial narrative in the Loggia di Psiche begins in the spandrels of the short side on the left as one enters and continues along the spandrels to the right to the second short side and then along the entrance side. These triangular surfaces represented a problematic format for artists. Raphael solved this challenge in ever new and surprising ways, causing the form of the painting's support and the composition of its figures to interact in particularly fortuitous and varied manners.This detail from the vault of the Loggia shows Venus, Ceres and Juno. In this spandrel the group of three goddesses is divided. Venus has learned of the secret affair and, driven by wrath, is seeking support from her female friends. But Ceres and Juno show little sympathy for her wrath and laments. The appealing portrayals of animals and insects, as well as the rich garlands of fruit and vegetables were devised by Giovanni da Udine. These are so painstakingly observed that experts can identify the particular genus of each variety depicted. Among the novelties to be enjoyed by the Renaissance spectator were recently discovered species of corn, squash and beans from the New World

33946-hercules.jpg	Ferdinando Gonzaga (1587-1626), after becoming the sixth duke of Mantua, commissioned new pictorial decoration for the ducal apartments. To decorate the galleries halls of his palace of delights, the duke commissioned Guido Reni to make a cycle of large canvases, which have been identified with the Labours of Hercules, now in the Louvre. The four pictures were made between 1617 and 1620 and without some disputes between the duke and the artist. The series is dedicated to Hercules, who was understood as a champion of physical strength and moral integrity and who was held up by modern princes as a model for the exercise of their political power.The scenes Reni illustrated were the death of Hercules on the funeral pyre; the battle between Hercules and Achelos for the hand of Deianira; the abduction of Deianira by the centaur Nessus; and finally Hercules vanquishing the Hydra, the only canvas that actually represents one of the mythical hero's twelve labours. In each scene the setting is neglected in favour of the monumental representation of the figures, which become the entire focus of the viewer's attention. They derive from the examples of Hellenistic sculpture that Reni would have studied during his time in Rome, and they dominate the picture plane with their powerful anatomies and deliberate gestures

05257-13carryi.jpg	Christ Carrying the Cross is an exceptionally dramatic painting, with a bold composition made up of closely packed heads for which no parallel exists in the art of the period around 1500. It is generally considered to be a late work and one of Bosch's greatest creations. The antithesis between good and evil, which was so crucial to Christian belief in Bosch's time, is raised to a climax. The painting is a peerless study of human facial expressions and demonic visages. Yet the chaotic and caricatured elements are never overwhelming and the painting seems to observe a complex balance of parallels and contrasts that emphasizes the serenity of Christ's gently modelled face in the centre. Amid all the tumult, we make out the clear profile of St Veronica withdrawing from the mob, the image of Christ's face - the 'vera icon' on her cloth

The various versions of the compositions are usually dated to the early 1770s on the basis of style. Their light colour scheme, rapid brushwork, and lighthearted subjects are similar to numerous paintings, often in oval format, that Fragonard produced in the years around 1770. During this period he was at work on his most celebrated cycle of decorative paintings, the large canvases called the Progress of Love, painted around 1771-72 at the request of Madame du Barry for her pleasure pavilion at Louveciennes outside Paris and now in the Frick Collection, New York. The present works related closely to two of four overdoors associated with this commission.These compositions and their variants typify the kind of quickly painted, small-scale decorative pictures that Fragonard frequently produced during his career

09391-1decolla.jpg	The Oratorio di San Giovanni Decollato in Rome houses the most important fresco cycle executed in the difficult decades after he Sack of Rome. It was commissioned by the Florentine confraternity of the Misericordia, founded in 1488, whose members had set themselves the task of helping those sentenced to death by providing them with spiritual support. Shortly after its founding the confraternity began the construction of the church and oratory next door. The completion of the church was delayed until 1553. By around 1536, on the other hand, the oratory had been completed to the extent that the painted decoration of the room could begin.The subject chosen for the fresco cycle, which covers the upper half of all four walls, was the story of the patron saint of the brotherhood, John the Baptist. For the execution of the cycle they selected Florentine (or Tuscan) artists working in Rome at the time. The most renowned Florentine painter active in Rome was Perino del Vaga, and several preparatory drawings for the frescoes by him have been preserved. Perino's designs were executed by younger Florentine artists, Jacopino del Conte and Cecchino (Francesco) del Salviati.Jacopino del Ponte painted on the entrance wall St John the Baptist Preaching (1538, on the left) and the Baptism of Christ (1541, on the right), on the right wall The Annunciation to Zachariah (1536-38). Salviati painted the Visitation (1538), the Birth of St John the Baptist (1551, on the right wall). The sixth fresco, the Arrest of St John the Baptist (c. 1543, on the left wall) was executed by Battista Franco, who came from Venice but worked in Florence. Pirro Ligorio painted the Feast of Herod with the Dance of Salome (1544-53, on the left wall). Starting in 1550, Salviati painted two apostles on the altar wall, Andrew (to the left of the altar) and Bartholomew (to the right). The altarpiece, an excellent panel with the Descent from the Cross was painted by Jacopino (1550-53). The fresco cycle was completed in 1553 with the Beheading of St John the Baptist. This was carried out by an assistant who reused some of Salviati's older drawings for several figures but whose overall composition did not come close to approximating the achievements of his master.The rivalry between Jacopino and Salviati, reported by Vasari, led to interruptions in the realization of the decorative program.The picture shows the view of the oratory towards the altar

05235-02pouter.jpg	The scene on the outer wings of the Haywain triptych is called Wayfarer or the Path of Life.The foreground is dominated by an emaciated, shabbily dressed man who is no longer young, carrying a wicker basket strapped to his back; he travels through a menacing landscape. A skull and several bones lie scattered at lower left; an ugly cur snaps at his heels, while the footbridge on which he is about to step appears very fragile indeed. In the background, bandits have robbed another traveller and are binding him to a tree, and peasants dance at the right to the skirl of a bagpipe. A crowd of people gather around an enormous gallows in the distance, not far from a tall pole surmounted by a wheel, used for displaying the bodies of executed criminals.Bosch's pilgrim makes his way through the treacherous world whose vicissitudes are represented in the landscape. Some of the dangers are physical, such as the robbers or the snarling dog, although the latter may also symbolize detractors and slanderers, whose evil tongues were often compared to barking dogs. The dancing peasants, however, connote a moral danger; like the lovers on top of the haywain, they have succumbed to the music of the flesh. In expressing the spiritual predicament of all mankind, the pilgrim thus resembles Everyman and his Dutch and German counterparts Elckerlijc and Jedermann, whose spiritual pilgrimages form the subjects of contemporary morality plays

28849-monk.jpg	"Acquired for the Museum in 1895 it was at first held to be by Moroni. Frizzoni traced it to Moretto in 1903. The subject is alternately designated as St Louis and St Placid. The martyr-saint is placed as in a portrait, even though everything else seems to point to a fragment of an altarpiece. The very position of the figure, the drapery on the right, which adumbrates a corresponding one on the left, with, in the centre, a Madonna against the background of a typical Veneto scenery, would appear to suggest a work of Venetian inspiration, such as can be seen in Tosio Martinengo of Brescia's altarpiece of St Anthony of Padua. His richly ""atmospheric"" Venetian colour scheme in particular bears witness to yet another attempt of his to test the tonal gamut. This is the particular moment in time that marks the birth of Moretto's true art at the confluence of Venetian painting and Brescian milieu, stamped by Moroni's, Romanino's and Savoldo's work, and seminal to an alternating pattern of fabulous colouring shot through with the cachets of the radical tradition of Lombardy"

By that time Ferenczy had already been to Paris, and after having settled in the small town near the River Danube, he tried synthesize the experiences he gained in the French capital with his own way of perceiving nature.The figures of the boys are monumentally set against the melancholy, barren landscape. Their movements are well observed, the rendering is far removed from any kind of narrative character. Although the gestures show different phases of motion, Ferenczy emphasizes the eternal character of the figures. With not a single bright colour patch to be found, the various shades of pearly grays dominate the finely wrought, dull colours.

41378-07_cover.jpg	This is one of the small panels that served as book covers for the semiannual ledgers of the biccherna and gabella, the financial and fiscal offices of the commune of Siena. The tradition of binding the ledger volumes with painted wood panels was instituted in 1257 and the oldest preserved panel covers the accounts of the second semester of 1258. The Archivio di Stato in Siena has a collection of over a hundred of these panels.The earliest covers usually show the camerlengo (the chief financial officer of the Republic), often a monk from the Cistercian abbey of San Galgano, as he writes in his account book, counts or disburses money, or supervises a clerk. The covers always display the coats of arms of at least four leading citizens who served as provveditori charged with overseeing the financial proceedings. The names of all these officers are prominently mentioned on the lower half of the panels, thus vouching for the accuracy of the accounts. While most of the panels of the 13th and 14th centuries are anonymous, we find among the later panels attributions to Paolo di Giovanni Fei, Giovanni di Paolo, Sano di Pietro, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and Benvenuto di Giovanni. Some 15th century panels record important events of Sienese history, such as the coronation of Pius II on a biccherna of 1460, or the Virgin protecting Siena from an earthquake on the biccherna of 1467

14343-triumph.jpg	Franciabigio enjoyed a close relationship with the Medici. He was the artist given the commission about 1520 by Giulio de' Medici for the entire cycle of frescoes at Poggio a Caiano, which he was expected to divide with Andrea del Sarto and Pontormo. Like Sarto, he frescoed one of the larger and more prominent lower fields in the room. His Triumph of Cicero is based on Plutarch in which the 'Pater Patriae', following a period of exile, is carried by a vigorous frieze of figures to the Capitoline reconstructed above in the background - an apparent allusion to Cosimo il Vecchio's return from Milan from his own exile. The fresco takes its place comfortably alongside what are now the more celebrated images by Andrea del Sarto and Pontormo, which together evoke the notion of a Medici Golden Age in an impressive private setting outside Florence. Like Sarto's, this fresco has lateral additions by Alessandro Allori in the right half

19833-02diptyc.jpg	Jesus sits exhausted on the plinth of an aedicula decorated in the style of the Italian Renaissance. In contrast to His strong, muscular body, Jesus' face is ravaged by the strains of the Passion, arousing pity in the beholder, who is also summoned to devotion by Mary's gesture towards her Son and by her pain-stricken gaze. Though Jesus wears a large crown of thorns, indicating that the Via Crucis (the Way of the Cross) has begun, the wounds are absent, so that the Crucifixion still lies in the future; he is not yet the Man of Sorrows. The architecture indicates Pilate's palace.

30484-salviati.jpg	This fresco is located in the vestibule of the Salviati Chapel in the church of San Marco in Florence.The Salviati family had been linked by marriage to the Medici (Pope Leo XI was the son of Francesca Salviati, the daughter of Giacomo Salviati and Lucrezia de' Medici). The Salviati family chapel centred on the sepulchre of the Florentine archbishop Antonino Pierozzi (Saint Antoninus); a bronze effigy topped the ark that contained his remains. Each of the three walls feature a large painting; flanking these were marble figures of saints that had ties to the patrons, the church, and the city, and above each of the marble figures was a corresponding bronze relief showing an episode from St Antoninus's life. The images set into the dome filled in further elements from the bishop's biography.Giambologna was the architect and the sculptor of the statues, furthermore, he oversaw the execution of the work by other artists. On the back wall, a canvas by Alessandro Allori depicts Christ in Limbo, while on the left and right walls Christ Healing the Leper by Francesco Morandini and Calling of Matthew by Giovan Battista Naldini, respectively, can be seen. The walls of the vestibule was decorated in fresco by Domenico Passignano following the completion of the chapel proper. The dome of the chapel is by Bernardino Poccetti.

31967-07halber.jpg	In the painting the young halberdier is intent on guarding the defensive rampart painted in the background. As in other works by Pontormo, the intense light that invests the foreground of the painting, contrasts strongly with the dark background and emphasizes the colour of the young man's clothing: the beige of the jacket, the white of the shirt, and the bright red of the pants and beret. A remarkable artistic skill is also discernible in the rendering of the various materials of the objects that distinguishes the figure of this young soldier: the burnished metal of the hand-guard, the leather of the thick belt to which it is attached, the fine grain of the wooden halberd, the gold of the light chain hanging rounded the man's neck and the medallion with the relief of Hercules and Anthaeus on the cap.Although the identity of the halberdier portrayed on this famous picture is debated, it is most likely the portrait of Francesco di Giovanni di Gherardo Guardi, a resident in Florence. Based on a seventeenth-century inventory of the estate of Riccardo Riccardi, formerly it was thought to be the portrait of the young Duke Cosimo I, who triumphed at Montemurlo over the last republican initiative led by Filippo  Strozzi and Baccio Valori (1537).The painting had a cover, painted by Bronzino, depicting Pygmalion and Galatea. The myth of Pygmalion and Galatea related to contemporary discourse about the relative merits of sculpture and painting. (Pygmalion was a sculptor who prayed to Venus for his statue to come alive.)A preparatory drawing of the painted version is in the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence

32056-shipping.jpg	Porcellis specialised in marine paintings, or seascapes. While the traditional seascape was usually a 'portrait' of a certain ship or an 'account' of a naval battle, Porcellis concentrated mainly on the rendering of light and atmosphere. The ships play a subordinate role.Porcellis used only a few colours, mostly shades of grey-blue and brown. He was thus one of the first practitioners of the 'tonal' manner of painting popular in the 1630s both in landscapes and still lifes.

13140-flight.jpg	The theme of the Rest on the Flight is primarily associated with the northern countries and first came into its own c. 1500 during the golden age of German painting. The paintings by Altdorfer and Lucas Cranach the Elder give the scene a magical, fairy-tale quality. The artist's conception of nature at that period was, of course, quite different from that of today. In the sixteenth century the forest was not seen as romantic, but rather as a place fraught with hidden dangers; a century later, when Elsheimer painted his Holy Family, nothing had changed. The angels and the figure of Joseph, even the treatment of light, were clearly inspired by Altdorfer's pictures, but the way in which the heavenly messengers descend to protect the travellers and light up the dark forest reveals the first traces of Baroque art.In this piece, Elsheimer combined two legendary events: the Holy Family resting during the flight to Egypt and the tender reunion of the Christ child with the infant John upon their return. On the left are the lamb of God with the staff (attribute of the Baptist) and the banner wound around the tree, bearing the words 'Ecce [agnus dei]'. On the right is Joseph the carpenter with his axe. Even thought he has a rightful place in the scene, he has also been formally allocated the function of a 'repoussoir' figure, adding a further element to the establishment of depth in the composition. Angels with wreaths and singing praises fill the space of the painting.Adam Elsheimer was born in 1578 in Frankfurt-on-Main. His first teacher, Philipp Uffenbach, owned a collection of old German drawings which had been left to him by Gr�newald. Here we find a direct link between Elsheimer's youth and the art of the D�rer period. The painter left his home at a fairly early age and went to Venice, where he worked with the Munich painter Hans Rottenhammer. It is presumably to this period that the Berlin painting belongs. Its style betrays the influence of Tintoretto, while the composition is modelled on similar works by Rottenhammer. But, in comparing the two German artists, one is aware of the marked superiority of the disciple, who was not content to accept the formality and smoothness of the late Mannerist school and who tried to inject a new truth into traditional themes. Only when he settled in Rome c. 1500 did he find his own conception reflected in the trend towards realism that emanated from the art of Caravaggio. Here he met the young Rubens and became acquainted with the landscape art of the Flemish painters Paul and Matth&#228;us Bril.Elsheimer's art combined an awareness of nature, which was rooted in old German tradition, with an appreciation of the human body, which derived from monumental paintings of the Renaissance. In his own paintings, however, Elsheimer never abandoned the small format which alone enabled him to continue treating details with such loving care. Although the slow pace at which he worked was criticized by his contemporaries, this did not in any way lessen their admiration of his work. His art, his observation of nature, had an influence that was not confined to Italy but also extended northwards, where Rubens and Rembrandt were also subject to it.The picture was acquired for the Berlin Gallery from a private collection in Nuremberg in 1928

14903-early05.jpg	In 1881, at the time of painting this work, Gauguin still had a successful career in stockbroking. The affluent lifestyle that this gave the family, including his wife Mette (probably the woman seated at the upright piano) and their four children is made clear in this painting. The solid bourgeois respectability is reflected in the cosy interior and the domestic comforts made evident in the foreground by the prominent still-life and the small work basket on the table.This painting was included in the seventh Impressionist exhibition of 1882, where Gauguin exhibited 13 works, and which he helped to organize. In treatment, however, the painting is quite different from typical Impressionist works of this period. It is produced on a much larger scale than Gauguin normally used at this time, quite different from the smaller, more intimate works of his Impressionist friends who favoured portable canvases for working in the open air. The rather dark tonality was something that was remarked upon by several critics, who found it heavy in comparison with typical Impressionist paintings. It was perhaps because of its rather orthodox treatment and the image of family life that it proclaims that made Mette Gauguin keep the painting in her personal collection until 1917

32258-10jupite.jpg	The painting is also known as The Childhood of Jupiter.The rejection of Venetian colouring, the sharper modelling, and the evolution of a composition based on carefully balanced movements are apparent in a small group of works which must be dated about 1637, of which the exquisite Nurture of Jupiter is typical.Jupiter was the son of Saturn, the god who devoured his children because it was prophesied that one of them would usurp him. Jupiter's mother fled to Crete where she gave birth to him in a cave. She gave Saturn a large stone wrapped in swaddling clothes which he unsuspectingly swallowed instead. Jupiter was brought up on the slopes of Cretan Mt Ida by nymphs who fed him on wild honey and on milk from the goat Amalthea.In this representation of the subject the goat suckles Jupiter.
