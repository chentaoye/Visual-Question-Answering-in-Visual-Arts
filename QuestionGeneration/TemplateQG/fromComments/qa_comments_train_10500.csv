21488-norandin.jpg	Lanfranco's large painting was commissioned by Cardinal Scipione for his villa at Frascati, at the time when the artist was working on The Council of the Gods in the loggia of the Villa Borghese (1624). It depicts an episode from Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (XII, 23 ff.), in which Norandino, King of Damascus and his bride Lucina are shipwrecked on the Ogre's island while on their honeymoon. They attempt to escape from the cave, but Lucina is discovered. Lanfranco's figures move theatrically and are rendered with rapid brushstrokes. The dense colour of the classical landscape make Lanfranco far removed from the delicate glazing of his rival Domenichino

10242-2lucret1.jpg	The story of the rape of Lucretia was one of the best-known episodes in the early history of Rome. It told how Sextus Tarquinius, brutal son of the tyrannical king, forced the virtuous wife Lucretia to accede to his lust by threatening that he would kill both her and her servant-boy if she refused, and afterwards claim that he had discovered them together in the act of adultery. To prevent this dishonour to her husband and family, Lucretia permitted herself to be raped, and was thereby able to tell her story and demand vengeance before she committed suicide.Lucretia is portrayed at three-quarter length with the upper body bared to reveal her breasts spilling from precious fabrics and with jewellery draped across her naked skin. The female figure convey an immediate impression of beauty and luxury. Characteristic features include the head leaning reflectively to one side and the way in which the hands clasp the handle of the dagger.There is a parallel to this composition, the Suicide of Lucretia by the Flemish painter Joos van Cleve. As compared with the Flemish example, Cranach's composition omits the actual stabbing and the blood on the dagger, and clearly shows Lucretia seated. These elements lend the figure a truly majestic calm and composure almost at odds with the drama of the events

03278-coronat.jpg	The polyptych of the Coronation of the Virgin, signed and dated 1388 by Bartolo di Fredi, was executed for a chapel in the church of San Francesco in the town of Montalcino to the south of Siena. The painter appears to have had a number of other connections with Montalcino, both as an agent for the Sienese government (in 1375 and 1376) and as a painter - securing at least four major commissions in the 1380s and 1390s.This altarpiece, which approaches the scale and complexity of the front face of Duccio's Maesta and of Pietro Lorenzetti's Carmelite altarpiece, offers a compelling example of the ambition of Sienese altarpiece design in the 1380s. The central panel displays an elegant representation of the Virgin at the moment of her coronation as queen of heaven. Above this arresting image is a smaller painting of the Virgin of the Assumption, a subject with strong political overtones for the Sienese and their subjects. The remaining panels are devoted to scenes from the early life of the Virgin and the events surrounding her death and assumption. The narrative follows a sequence that begins on the left-hand side of the predella, progresses from left to right across the predella and then proceeds from the lower left to lower right of the side panels, ending with the upper left and upper right side panels

07212-canal500.jpg	In this painting, Canaletto shows the Canale Grande teeming with boats, the gondolieri in their traditional costumes, the colourful decorations, the crowds lining the banks of the canal, the flags and pelmets on the windows and balconies. What is more, he conscientiously renders a specific location in Venice, seen from the Ca' Foscari, with its palatial fa�ades, its simple houses, its stairways, rooftops, chimneys and terraces and between them all, the wide, azure expanse of the canal. He is fascinated by the contrast between the momentary pageantry with all its light and colour, its exhilarating presence, and the city itself, steeped in tradition, in which celebration after celebration passes through its ancient walls down the centuries

This picture, which shows the Adoration of the Magi in the foreground and the Annunciation to the Shepherds in the background, belongs to a series of seven panels depicting the life of Christ.

From that time he was to have a virtual monopoly of portraits of the king and queen on the scale of life, having rendered the work of his predecessors at court old-fashioned. In a series of huge canvases strategically placed at the end of great galleries in the king's various residences, he displayed the power and splendour of the British monarchy and of the early Stuart dynasty, modernising traditional themes of royal panegyric

29209-trilog3.jpg	"The second episode in the chonology of the Bible was painted as the third picture of Munk�csy's trilogy. The other two pictures had been in Philadelphia for years when Munk�csy was persuaded by G�bor K�d�r, a Hungarian graphic artist and printer, to make the trilogy complete. (In fact, it was K�d�r who arranged for the pictures to be taken on tour to exhibit them.) Munk�csy's choice of subject matter was probably influenced by ""The Governor of Judaea"", a short story by Anatole France and by Munk�csy's impaired health and mental status. All this urged him to paint the second and painful meeting of Christ and Pilate instead of Christ's glorious resurrection or  ascension.The portrait of the Saviour reflects Munk�csy's state of mind. Pilate introduces him to his people by saying, ""Ecce Homo!"". Christ is not guilty according to the laws of Rome, Pilate says to the people who respond to Pilate's words with gestures. The gestures of men are rude and indicate attack, while those of women are gentle and protective. Munk�csy's contemporaries identified Mary, John, the Evangelist, the penitent Magdalene, Nicodemus, Joseph of Arithea and Judas in the picture. Munk�csy's picture is rather descriptive. The last work of the tired master was taken to the Millenary Exhibition in Budapest by Munk�csy himself.Later, the picture was exhibited in Vienna, Bruxelles, England and Ireland. James Joyce, a young man at the time, saw it in Dublin in 1899. Although ""Ecce Homo"" was taken to America, too, it never met the other two pictures of the trilogy there because first they were in the country residence of Wanamaker and later, in 1907-11, they were restored. In 1911, a Munk�csy Room was opened in Wanamaker's department store, yet the two journalists who described it never even mentioned ""Ecce Homo"". They went to Philadelphia in order to find out if Wanamaker was willing to give the picture to Hungary as ""Ecce Homo"" had been exhibited in Venice and Budapest in 1914. It was suggested that Munk�csy's Trilogy should be placed side by side in a roman catholic cathedral to be built. John Wanamaker was ready to sell the pictures but even the sum of 120,000 crowns required for ""Ecce Homo"" by the English - American consortium could never be raised. In the meantime, World War I broke out and nobody cared about culture. Frigyes D�ri, a trade counseller who had been living in Vienna, appeared in the right moment to solve the hopeless problem: he bought ""Ecce Homo"" for 76,000 gold crowns. In his last will, he left the picture together with his art collection to Debrecen. A gallery was built for it with skylights  where the picture has been on show since 1930. In 1993 ""Golgota"" and in 1995 ""Christ in Front of Pilate"" were placed on both sides of ""Ecce Homo"". Thus, efforts to unite the three pictures proved to be successful, although the exhibition of the trilogy is only a temporary one"

18892-magdatwo.jpg	When Alessandro Ludovisi, formerly the cardinal archbishop of Bologna, became Pope Gregory XV (1621&#151;25), artists who had worked for his family in his native city were called to Rome, among them Domenichino, Guido Rent, Albani, and Guercino, the latter responding to the pope's invitation in 1621.The Penitent Magdalen was painted for the church of Santa Maria Maddalena delle Convertite in Rome's Via del Corso. The church was damaged by fire in January 1617 and rebuilt during the pontificate of Paul V (1605&#151;21) under the patronage of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini (who may have also commissioned the painting). The artist depicted the meeting between Mary Magdalene and the angels in front of Christ's empty sepulcher as narrated in the Gospel of John (20:11-15). The painting is striking for its classical, almost statuesque figures, its dense tonal values, and the clever chiaroscuro play of the splendid landscape and sky. The monumental figure's almost heroic aspect is underlined by the skillfully painted drapery and commanding pose which dominate the picture plane. Guercino emphasizes the clasped hands of the kneeling saint, whose face is contorted in sorrow as she leans against the closed tomb - empty now that Christ has risen. The Magdalen's gaze is directed towards the large nail held by an angel at the right.Guercino's presence in the Eternal City, although brief in time since he had already returned to Cento by 1625, deeply affected local culture, dominated and divided as it was in those days by the endless conflict between classicism and realism. Its location in the center of the city made the painting very accessible and much admired by numerous artists, clearly influencing Pier Francesco Mola and inspiring a drawing by Van Dyck.

06804-scenes1.jpg	The story of Tobit, a book from the Apocrypha, was a particularly popular text because it is devoted to the wanderings of a boy, Tobias, in search of a cure for the blindness of his father, Tobit. Throughout his journey, Tobias is protected by a guardian angel, Raphael, and accompanied by his faithful dog. As so many young Florentines were commercial travelers or apprentices, often at worrisome distances from home, their parents had sufficient grounds for concern. Tobias' happy tale, along with its reassuring filial piety, was one they seldom tired of telling, whether in art or life.Two grand, richly narrative friezelike images, known as 'spalliere' are ascribed to Bugiardini. The first panel shows, from left to right, Tobias taking leave of his parents, journeying with Raphael to catch the fish whose liver will cure Tobit, his engagement to Sarah, and their bridal night.

09023-02egypt.jpg	Most of Claude's paintings were conceived in complementary pairs. This was presumably also true of the landscape with accessory biblical scene illustrated here (one of the artist's rare vertical-format works). It was executed for one of his most important patrons, Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna, chief field marshal of the Kingdom of Naples and one of the most brilliant figures in Roman society of the day.As in all of his views, Lorrain based this imagined rather than depicted landscape on an idealized distance. In the foreground and middle ground we see signs of cultural life - pastoral, mythological, occasionally biblical scenes, temples, architecture - which lead the eye to a far-off realm of yearning. At the same time, the artist stages the transcending power of light.In this imaginary landscape the subject of the Flight into Egypt is barely noticeable, and simply serves as an excuse for a landscape bathed with the golden light of dusk, with orange-tinted skies - yielding to an intense blue at the top - and a light mist which envelops everything and softens all the outlines

It enjoyed its greatest flowering in the late sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries under the rule of the Spanish viceroys. The architectural redesign and modernization begun shortly after 1581. The splendid interior decoration set the style of the Neapolitan Baroque.The first step in the redesign of the Gothic church of the charterhouse in the style of the Counter-Reformation was the painting of the choir, which was accomplished in two phases (1589 and 1595) by Giuseppe Cesari.

43732-landscap.jpg	Although modest in scale, this type of painting is of great importance as an early example of a work dominated by a landscape, which heralded a new interest in such subject matter. Wals was born in Cologne and travelled to Italy, where he initially settled in Naples, and found employment colouring engravings. He later emerged as a landscape specialist, working in oil and gouache, and painted in Rome, Genoa and nearby Savona. He studied with Agostino Tassi, but is chiefly remembered because he taught the greatest of all French landscape painters, Claude Lorrain, whose ability to create harmonious compositions, must in part be indebted to the precedent of Wals.Wals is thought to have died in an earthquake in Calabria. Although his work was admired during his lifetime and is recorded in distinguished collections, it was neglected by art historians before being re-evaluated from the 1960s onwards. He favoured small circular landscapes (other examples are in the Ashmolean and Fitzwilliam Museums) and a subdued palette, often paring the composition down to a series of distinct horizontal planes. The figures in this painting may be intended as Christ and Saint Peter, although the identification is by no means certain. The building is possibly the Tor di Quinto, a structure Wals depicted in other works, which survives by the river Tiber, near Rome

23198-41monaco.jpg	"This panel originally formed a diptych with the St Jerome in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Small though they may be, as a diptych these little panels form an impressive and rare monument to Italian painting for private devotion. St Jerome has removed the thorn from the lion's paw, illustrating the monastic virtue of chastity, while the Virgin displays her humility by seating herself on the ground.It is believed that Lorenzo's diptych of St Jerome and the Virgin was used as a visual aid by a learned monk in the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Florence, where Lorenzo also lived and for which he made many works of art.One genuinely new Marian theme was the Madonna dell'Umilt&#224;, or Madonna of Humility. That title has come down to us more or less by accident, thanks to a number of scenes of the Virgin bearing the inscription ""Maria dell'Umilt&#224;"" or some such designation. Here the Virgin is seated not on a throne but on a cushion on the ground. It is assumed that all Virgins seated on the ground, with or without a cushion, were regarded at the time as humble Virgins. The first images of the Madonna dell'Umilt&#224;, datable around 1300, appeared simultaneously on altarpieces, murals and small panels for private devotion. Frescos with the Madonna dell'Umilt&#224; were the object of special veneration in northern Italy.

In order to catch the lovers in an act of infidelity, Vulcan forged a net of bronze so fine that it was invisible to the naked eye. This he placed over his wife's couch so as to entrap her with Mars at their next tryst.

31770-s_thomas.jpg	To the testament of Andrea Stazio, a Venetian nobleman who died in 1722, we owe a cycle of paintings of great importance in the history of Venetian art. The will provided that twelve canvases should be painted for the church of San Stae (Venetian for St Eustace). All similar in size, they depict episodes in the lives of the Apostles and their martyrdom. The commission was given to twelve different Venetian painter, ranging from the aged Nicol&#242; Bambini, then seventy-one, through to Giambattista Tiepolo, almost at the start of his career.All the paintings were completed within a few months, in 1722 and early 1723. The artists were the following in alphabetic order: Antonio Balestra, Nicol&#242; Bambini, Gregorio Lazzarini, Silvestro Manaigo, Giambattista Mariotti, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giambattista Piazzetta, Giambattista Pittoni, Sebastiano Ricci, Giambattista Tiepolo, Angelo Trevisano and Pietro Uberti. They vied with each other to transform the church into a remarkable showcase of currents and developments in eighteenth-century Venetian art.Pittoni's painting is part of the cycle of the Apostles. Despite the cruelty of the subject, the painter's rendering is notable for its grace and delicacy. Pittoni, one of the most brilliant eighteenth-century artists, produced a number of other works for San Stae

06017-praise_h.jpg	Fish still-lifes developed as a category during the seventeenth century - not an astonishing phenomenon when we recall that fishing, particularly for herring and cod, was a mainstay of the Dutch economy. A notable exponent of the type is Abraham van Beyeren. As the Dutch love for flowers, their love for seafood is proverbial. The Haarlemer Joseph de Bray, son of Salomon and brother of Jan, celebrated this taste in his picture, dated 1656, dedicated to the apotheosis of the pickled herring.Resting behind the large, succulent herring and other objects in the painting's foreground, there is an elaborate tablet, draped with a festoon of herrings and requisite onions, inscribed with a poem by the Remonstrant preacher and poet Jacob Westerbaen: 'In praise of the Pickled Herring' published in 1633. After telling of the herring's delight to the eye, palette, and its other qualities, Westerbaen adds that consumption of it 'Will make you apt to piss/And you will not fail/(With pardon) to shit/And ceaselessly fart...' - proof, if it is needed, that plain profane messages are as likely embodied in Dutch paintings as spiritual ones. The painting was evidently a success. In the following year he painted another, somewhat larger still-life, now in Aachen, dedicated to the same subject.

11287-309delac.jpg	When Louis-Philippe created the Mus�e de l'Histoire de France at Versailles, two paintings were commissioned from Delacroix: The Battle of Taillebourg and The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople. For these vast canvases, Delacroix was obliged to open a studio, and train his own assistants. This time, the critics were completely won over. The derring-do of Louis IX on his white charger riding down the English defences on the Taillebourg bridge and the famous capture of Constantinople (1204) acted as a balm after the terrible defeat of Waterloo. And yet Delacroix's method in these paintings is unchanged; again the implications of the event are focused in a single scene, again he shows the catastrophes of war and the women delivered over to the victors. His goal is not to describe the event - though the details are carefully researched and the armour and standards historically correct - but to make the spectator feel its emotional consequences. The inspiration flowing through these 'grandes machines' is no less personal and romantic than it was in The Barque of Dante and The Death of Sardanapalus.

41288-04martin.jpg	There are two related panels, painted on both sides, in the Hungarian National Gallery which once were the wings of an altarpiece dedicated to St Martin and St Nicholas. One of the wings represents St Martin and the Beggar (outer side) and the Sermon of St Martin in Albenga (inner side). The other wing depicts St Nicholas and the Daughters of the Nobleman in Pataria (outer side) as well as the scene St Nicholas Resurrects Three Deads.The panel represents a legendary scene from the life of St. Martin. The Bishop, having given his clothes to a needy man, celebrates mass in poor, hastily acquired garments. At the elevation of the Host angels descend to cover his bare arms.The altar table in the sanctuary, shown in great detail, is decorated with a picture within the picture: a horizontally arranged retable with a scene of the Crucifixion. This is of special importance in the history of the development of winged altars in Hungary, for it demonstrates that this early type of retables of which very few examples have survived, was still in use at the end of the fifteenth century. Seen against the embroidered white altar-cloth the shadows are effective. The artist's representation of the missal is most realistic; also the representation of the mitre and the Gothic style objects made of precious metals, the ciborium between two candlesticks, the chalice and the paten, the latter only just visible under the edge of the communion cloth. Realism was not, however, an end in itself; the painter introduced these details to create an atmosphere of wonder before the legendary scene. The realistic characters are also imbued with piety. The portraitlike features of the male figure kneeling on the right suggest that it was he who commissioned the altarpiece. The painter's endeavours to represent the interior in perspective, the sharp folds shown almost in relief and the subtle colour effects all place the master of this panel among the finest Hungarian painters active in the late fifteenth century

18762-guard304.jpg	Francesco Guardi, although remembered almost exclusively for his real and imaginary Venetian scenes, worked with his older brother Giovanni Antonio on paintings in many genres: altarpieces, mythological narratives, battle pictures, and even murals. A newly discovered altarpiece, dating from after his brother's death around 1777, proves that Francesco continued to paint some large-scale pictures after the dissolution of the family firm. But from around 1760 his main work consisted of views indebted to Canaletto, whose designs he often copied. Soon, however, Guardi freed himself both from literal topography and Canaletto's more prosaic manner, to concentrate on poetic capricci - airy compilations of Venetian architectural motifs such as this picture, as well as ruins, and evocations of the sparkling waters of the lagoon which he was the first painter to depict. His pastel colours and glancing touch may have been influenced by his sister's husband, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Guardi's pictures, however, became smaller and smaller, some barely larger than matchboxes. These were presumably intended as tourist trinkets, souvenirs for the boudoir rather than mementoes of the Grand Tour for great English country houses.Unlike most views, many of Guardi's imaginary architectural vistas are vertical in format. After his final return to Venice in about 1756, Canaletto had produced some small vertical pictures of the Piazza San Marco seen from under, or through, its colonnade, and Guardi may have been inspired by these. Canaletto's viewer stands still like a camera on a tripod, but in Guardi's picture we are impelled to follow the little figure in lemon yellow carrying its load of what looks like white laundry; we stroll from sunlight into shadow, to emerge once again into a sunlight all the brighter for being framed in light-reflecting darkness, just as the scale of the echoing arches gains from the small stature of the figures beneath. Charity is being dispensed. It may be spring, perhaps early in the morning. Sunshine falls in patches of pale pink, slightly darker on faraway brick walls and on a cloak in the foreground, and, darker still, in the line of a sunlit flagpole. The yellow of our distant guide's robe is drawn forward onto a brass lantern - sky blue fades to white, lemon yellow and pink colours emerge from a silver haze and merge again to enliven the silver and pewter-grey stone. There is no pure red anywhere and just a few nervous touches and lines of black. The perfect harmony of this unpretentious picture can only be experienced in front of the original - when it is as consoling as music, or the memory of a voyage to the Venice of our dreams

In 1516 to 1518 the Sienese brotherhood of Mary and Bernardino commissioned Girolamo del Pacchia, Sodoma, and Domenico Beccafumi to fresco the walls of their oratory with a cycle on the life of Mary, The artists painted two stories each: Pacchia, the Birth of Mary and the Annunciation; Sodoma, the Presentation of the Virgin and the Coronation of Mary; and Beccafumi, the Betrothal of Mary and the Death of the Virgin. The missing scenes on the right-hand longitudinal wall, the Visitation and the Assumption of the Virgin were not painted by Sodoma until the late 1520s, and Baccafumi's altarpiece still later, between 1535 and 1537. The cycle begins on the left wall (The Birth of Mary to THe Betrothal of Mary), and continues above the altar wall (Annunciation) and the right longitudinal wall (Visitation to Assumption of the Virgin) through the second of the short walls (The Coronation of Mary). In addition to the stories from the life of Mary, there are four frescoed standing figures of Franciscan saints in the corners of the longitudinal walls

03323-bernard.jpg	This altarpiece is the first major public painting Fra Bartolomeo supplied after becoming a friar. It represents a poised Virgin majestically carried in from the left to right on a flotilla of angels that halts before St Bernard. The standing saints act as witnesses to the mystery unfolding before them. Two scenes in the background supplement the iconography: Francis receiving the stigmata and further up a meeting between Francis and Dominic. The altarpiece is distinguished by its bright colouristic effects, recalling much earlier precedents from the late Trecento or early Quattrocento in Fra Angelico and Lorenzo Monaco.Fra Bartolomeo's Vision of Saint Bernard recalls Perugino's earlier treatment of the same subject. Fra Bartolommeo locates the scene out-of-doors instead of in a loggia, and he significantly expands the angelic company of the Madonna and the Christ Child.

30837-nicholas.jpg	"This painting was part of a series of eight panels painted for an altar complex in the Church of the Annunziata in Florence. The commission for the pictures was originally given to Filippino Lippi, and then was passed to Perugino, who finished the work in November of 1507. The altar was definitively dismantled and dispersed in 1654. Five other paintings from the group are known to survive; two at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, two at Altenburg and one in a private collection in South Africa.Filippo Benizi (1233-1285) was a general superior of the Order of the Servites, and credited with reviving the order.

11609-adam_eve.jpg	Domenichino was perhaps the most sophisticated painter of the seventeenth century, so much so, in fact, that at times his work can seem rarefied. He also played an important cultural role with regard to the theory of art. He studied under the Carracci cousins, first in Bologna and then in Rome (where at the beginning of the century he assisted Annibale who was then working in the Farnese Gallery and on the large lunettes in Palazzo Doria Pamphilj).Domenichino was completely bowled over by the simple, classical, and elegant beauty of Raphael's art, having a deep admiration for all the great masters of the early sixteenth century. His career was mainly spent trying to revive that wonderful era of the High Renaissance, but he did this with a completely up-to-date critical and intellectual approach

25927-cremona2.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. His contract regarding the frescoes above the next arch stipulated that his works should surpass in beauty Boccaccino's frescoes of the first two arches, which had been unveiled in 1515. Melone painted the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents with a wealth of motifs and drastic narrative. The protagonists have left the ideal, solemnly harmonious sphere of joyful childhood that Boccaccino's style suitably mirrors and have entered into a dramatic world depicted in Melone's coarser style.Melone continued the cycle on the right wall, he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists

33409-32newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 566.Christ's forgiveness of the adulteress is described in the Gospel of St John, chapter 8. Rembrandt shows the moment at which the Pharisees, attempting to outwit Jesus, ask him whether, in accordance with the Mosaic law, she should be stoned to death. Jesus replies 'He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone'.The painting is an outstanding example of Rembrandt's gifts as a colourist, an aspect of his art which is sometimes forgotten. Within the dark interior of the temple, golds, reds, greens and browns glow as they are struck by a strong fall of light. In some respects this is an unusual painting for its date, 1644, in that the composition - the small figures dwarfed by the cavernous space of the temple - as well as the elaboration of detail and the degree of finish, especially in the background, hark back to the style of paintings of a decade earlier (such as The Presentation in the Temple of 1631). However, the broader treatment of the foreground figures is consistent with Rembrandt's greater freedom of handling in the 1640s and, above all, the quieter, restrained mood of the picture and its size accord with a move away from the intensely dramatic, large-scale Biblical scenes of a few years earlier.The painting has an interesting history. It was almost certainly the painting of this subject which, at 1500 guilders, was the highest valued item in the inventory of the Amsterdam art dealer, Johannes de Renialme, drawn up in 1657. Subsequently it was owned by the Six family until sold to a dealer in 1803. Four years later it was sold in London to John Julius Angerstein whose paintings, purchased by the British government in 1824, formed the basis of the National Gallery's collection

It incorporates all of the elements of Pacino's emblematic approach to narrative.The left wing of the diptych is divided into three scenes. The depicted scenes are St John on Patmos (upper left), Virgin and Child Enthroned with Sts Paul and Francis (upper right) and the Death of the Virgin (bottom). Although the perspective of the Virgin's throne at the upper right is competently rendered by early fourteenth-century standards, its purpose in establishing a believably naturalistic setting is countermanded by the impossible dichotomy of scale between the Virgin and the two saints and by the awkward placement of the latter, who hover or float at the edges of the platform

03385-stillife.jpg	Baschenis, an artist from Bergamo, was a highly specialized painter who worked almost exclusively on the portrayal of stringed instruments. The nearby town of Cremona, a famous centre of violin and lute making, provided him with his models. However, unlike the Netherlandish artists, who often used musical instruments as symbols of hearing, while the transience of the notes recalled the transience of life, Baschenis does not paint scenes of allegorical or moral significance. His emphasis lies on the aesthetic and decorative aspects, as reflected in his singular attention to painterly and ornamental detail in portraying these instruments.A theorbo, a tenor lute and a descant lute, as well as a violin with bow can be seen together with a writing box, a quill and a book of music set on a table against which a cello is leaning. A mysterious life develops between these objects. The mild sheen on the surface of the woods and the changing hues on the body of the lute create a visual autonomy that almost makes us forget the actual purpose of these instruments. Their curves present unusual viewpoints as though by chance. These musical objects are an almost tangible feast of tranquillity for the eyes.

08546-3figure6.jpg	This painting combines the genres of portrait with still-life. The ordinary woman in her plain, blue dress is viewed frontally, and the vertical axis of the painting passes through her. A vertical line appears to run from the parting in her hair, via the bridge of her nose, down to the fold in the centre of her dress, emphasizing the upright bearing of the figure and giving her a dignified, solemn presence. C�zanne invests everyday objects with a presence comparable to that of the figure. The apparent fold in the centre of the painting has formal parallels in the spoon in the cup and the handle of the coffeepot. Both verticals are further elongated by the shadow. The circle of the cup is echoed in the collar of the dress, and the fold in the tablecloth is repeated in the folds of the dress.Of all colours used, none stands out from the rest. The rust red of the tablecloth recurs in the figure and in the dress, as does the metallic blue of the coffeepot. Even the pink and white tones of the flower pattern on the wallpaper shine through underneath the blue of the dress

37417-tailors.jpg	Trades and domestic industry were popular subjects in seventeenth-century Dutch painting. In most images of tailors we see them at work at their foremost activity, cutting the cloth, just like in the present painting by Pieter van Slingeland. As a tailor worked on pieces of cloth brought on to him, he did not have a supply of textiles in his shop; on the shelf behind the tailor seen here, too, there are only a few pieces, no doubt brought by clients to be worked on. There is a good supply of thread, however,  hanging in a bunch from the ceiling. The tailor and his apprentices are working close to the window, their trade requires good light. The master is cutting carefully, his glasses on his nose, one assistant is concentrating on stitching, while the  other is picking a thread from the bunch. This painting could well function as an allegory of Sight

19565-p_wildt.jpg	In 1657, the leaders of the United Provinces sent warships under the command of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter (1607-1676) to the Spanish port of C�diz. where the Dutch captured two French pirate ships to prevent the pirates from obstructing Dutch trade. as a reward for their success, the admiralty of Amsterdam  gave De Ruyter and three of his captains, Gideon de Wildt (1624-1665) among them, a gold chain and medallion. It was probably to mark this occasion that De Wildt commissioned a pair of portrait of himself and his wife from the Amsterdam elite's favourite painter, Bartholomeus van der Helst.In this portrait, behind the three-quarter figure are three warships, sailing beneath a cloud-strewn sky. As was common practice in the studios of the time, such traditional details in portraits of naval commanders were generally executed by artists who specialized in marine scenes.

(The painting was available as an engraving.)In the Brutus story, the oath was sworn as a promise of individual revenge against a corrupt monarchy, and it was somewhat inconsistent and redundant to have noble and virtuous Romans swear an oath to affirm a virtue that was beyond question - patriotism. But the motif of the oath allowed David to present a unified and memorable distillation of a highly involved story

06428-01januar.jpg	"This is the first of a series of paintings of the Months, of which only five remain. This painting representing January reveals winter's firm grip on the countryside. Three hunters return with only a rabbit to show for their efforts. Their feet press into the powdery snow. Nearby rabbit prints mark its recent passage. The tired dogs shiver against the cold. Snow blankets the world. Bruegel deftly dusted the bushes and tree branches in white. The ponds below are frozen, and great icicles hand from the millwheel on the lower right. Leafless trees dot the countryside. Bruegel subtle colour palette with its muted earth tones perfectly evokes the season. It also masks the obvious cross-diagonal construction of the landscape. The four trees in the foreground conveniently diminish in perspective. The figures are not the picture's primary subject, yet we, like the child at left, eagerly watch the roaring fire or mentally prepare to join the skaters below. Figures transverse distant fields. Others attempt to douse the chimney fire in the farmhouse just beyond the village church. Although Bruegel recounted a particular time of year, there is a timeless quality about the picture.The painting may strike the observer as a natural view of the landscape, but in fact it reveals Bruegel's great artistry in stylisation. The picture is dominated by two ""cold"" colours, namely the white of the snow and the pale green of the sky and the ice. People, trees, dogs, birds are all dark or black, thereby contradicting the customary colour associations: winter brings sleep and death"

In connection with his remarkable talent for sensitive rendering of the texture of different fabrics, which in all of his mature paintings constitutes a major pictorial motive, Ter Borch showed a preference for subjects associated with Vanity or Luxury.

10547-apollo1.jpg	The great hall of festivities was designed to hold receptions, balls and musical entertainments and is quite original, also in terms of its size (14 x 24 metres): it is the largest existing room in a private Venetian residence. The real space of the room seems to be the centre of a larger imaginary area that extends beyond the false architecture painted on the walls. These trompe l'oeils, or the vanishing perspective of architectural elements used to artificially extend the real space, are generally attributed to Pietro Visconti, a perspective painter from Lombardy. The fresco in the middle of the ceiling and the fine monochromes at the centre of each wall, however, are by Giovanni Battista Crosato. The fresco in the middle of the ceiling shows Apollo's Carriage rising in flight, drawn by four white horses and surrounded by a jumble of allegorical figures, to bring light to all parts of the world (indeed, representations of Europe, Asia, America and Africa appear at the sides); the latter, with mythological episodes featuring Apollo, evidently make up a kind of illustrated poem in honour of the Rezzonico family

44262-portusyn.jpg	De Witte was born in Alkmaar, the son of a schoolmaster. He worked in Delft and entered the Delft guild in 1642. By 1652 he settled in Amsterdam where he spent the rest of his life.In Amsterdam de Witte continued to paint views of Delft churches, but he was inspired more often by the metropolis's grand buildings: its Old Church, lofty New Church, Stock Exchange, and, after it was consecrated in 1675, its Portuguese-Jewish Synagogue.This synagogue was built between 1671 and 1675 for the Spanish and Portuguese (Sephardic) Jews who as of the end of the sixteenth century had settled in Amsterdam where they could profess their faith in relative freedom. In this respect the synagogue symbolizes the tolerant religious climate in the Republic of the United Netherlands. De Witte portrayed the synagogue during a service, with believers wearing hats draped with pale yellow talliths, or fringed prayer shawls. To the left of middle is the teba, or bimah (the platform in the middle of a synagogue from where the Torah is read), with on it the cantor and the parnas, or synagogue president, and against the back wall the Hechal, or Holy Ark.It is known from contemporary sources that the synagogue was considered a sight worth seeing. This is confirmed in the present painting: most of the figures in the foreground are non-Jewish visitors.The synagogue features more often in paintings, but only its exterior and as part of a city view. In so far as is known, De Witte is the only seventeenth-century painter to have portrayed the interior of this building. He did it at least three times

36701-nativit.jpg	In the porch of a house the Virgin kneels beside the Child lying before her on a tattered blanket spread over a bundle of straw. Shepherds approach from the right to worship the Child. Between the wooden posts supporting the roof of the stable we have a glimpse of a hilly landscape with a river flowing through it.In Schongauer's paintings, as in D�rer's, draughtsmanship is all important. This is, well exemplified by the small Berlin panel, which may once have formed part of a small altar and which, for fine detail, could hardly be surpassed. It was natural, therefore, that as early as the sixteenth century, Rogier van der Weyden should have been regarded as Schongauer's teacher. Although this is most unlikely, as Rogier died in 1464, it is nevertheless relevant to the Netherlandish training which Schongauer received. About 1469/70 he visited both Burgundy and the Netherlands, where as his early works show, he made a particularly close study of the works of Rogier, including the Bladelin Altar, which was then in Middelburg and is now in Berlin.Martin Schongauer was the most important German painter and copper-engraver before D�rer. In the latter capacity in particular, he won a reputation that extended beyond the frontiers of Germany. The young D�rer was one of his admirers and was anxious to meet him, but their paths never crossed. Schongauer, who came from Colmar in Alsace, was, like D�rer, the son of a goldsmith, and the skills they inherited undoubtedly contributed to the fact that both artists became masters in the art of copper-engraving.In 1471, Schongauer settled in his native town, Colmar. It was here, in 1473, that he produced his major painting, the Madonna of the Rosehedge, for St Martin's Church in Colmar. The small Berlin panel must have been painted fairly soon after and may have helped to earn him the affectionate nickname, which his own contemporaries converted into a proper name: Martin Sch�n or H�bsch Martin.Of the early history of this picture, which was acquired for the Berlin Gallery from a London art-dealer in 1902, nothing is known.

32788-25drago3.jpg	Appointed to the order of the Garter in 1504 by Henry VII of England, Guido da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, commissioned Raphael to paint a picture of Saint George as a gift for the King, and appointed Baldassare Castiglione, author of The Courtier, to bear it to England. Until recently, the composition of the same subject in the National Gallery of Art, Washington was identified as the painting sent to England. However, it is debated now which of the two paintings was really sent to England.Saint George is one of the most popular of Christian saints and is the patron saint of England. He was also a favourite subject of Renaissance artists, who depicted him slaying the dragon. According to legend, this monster infested a marsh outside the walls of a city and, with his fiery breath, could poison all who came near. In order to placate the dragon, the city furnished him with a few sheep every day. But when the supply of sheep was exhausted, the sons and daughters of the citizens became the victims. The lot fell one day on the princess, and the King reluctantly sent her forth to the dragon. Saint George happened to be riding by and, seeing the maiden in tears, commended himself to God and transfixed the dragon with his spear.St George's lance has been broken in the struggle, but the proud knight is about to vanquish the dragon with the sword, and so free the princess, who is fleeing on the right. By the middle of the 16th century this panel formed a pair with Raphael's St. Michael. Even though the latter was painted somewhat earlier, the fact that they are the same size and have a comparable iconography implies that Raphael intended that the saints should belong together

26648-10_3pr7.jpg	God allows the youthful Jonah, the seer of Nineveh whom he rescued from the belly of the whale within three days - the time between Christ's death and his resurrection, - to challenge him in his bold nakedness, The figure mocks every law of composition and perspective. Michelangelo conceived Jonah as an Old Testament Prometheus touched by grace and presents us with a solution to the riddle of good and evil. An artist, himself a rebellious Titan, proffers a solution that spells deliverance in what may be the grandest piece of dialectical theology ever stated in terms of art. The rebellious Prophet, whom God would not have otherwise, looks up directly at his self begetting and affirming Maker. In his expression, scorn and rebellion are giving place to joy, delight, love and filial response, and the ecstatic contemplation of God. The monster of the sea, the calabash tree of the texts, and the turbulent genii form an animated background, unusually bucolic and idyllic for Michelangelo

31010-soothsay.jpg	"After a period of study in Bologna in the ""bottega"" of Giuseppe Maria Crespi, Piazzetta settled in Venice permanently and developed his art and his career without leaving the city. At the beginning, his paintings were characterized by a harshly intense play of chiaroscuro and densely laid on paint, clearly the result of his contact with the robust brilliance of Crespi. Around half-way through the fourth decade of the eighteenth century, his paintings relaxes somewhat into a style which is characterized by the sensually sonorous timbre of colour which he achieved by means of a light which his contemporaries called ""lume solivo"".The artist's masterpiece in this phase of his activity was ""The Soothsayer"" the real subject of which is the meeting of two young peasant girls with one of them trying to attract the attention of the little dog which her companion is rather nonchalantly holding in her left arm. This moment of everyday life is transformed into pastoral idyll by the extremely careful fitting together of the planes of the scene and the grouping of the figures who are dominated by the glowing beauty of the young country-girl on whom the ""lumo solivo"" concentrates and who thus becomes the highest note of the rich symphony of chromatic shadings"

It is a large fresco painted in the crown and spandrels of an arch.In the right spandrel the heroic St George prepares to intervene on behalf of the Princess. Pisanello placed the scene in Verona, showing the princess and the saint in the most elegant clothes of the day. In the background, men, presumably traitors, hang from the gallows.

32842-00disput.jpg	The fresco can be seen as a portrayal of the Church Militant below, and the Church Triumphant above. A change in content between a study and the final fresco shows that the Disputa and The School of Athens can be seen as having a common theme: the revealed truth of the origin of all things, in other words the Trinity. This cannot be apprehended by intellect alone (philosophy), but is made manifest in the Eucharist.The painting is built around the monstrance containing the consecrated Host, located on the altar. Figures representing the Triumphant Church and the Militant Church are arranged in two semicircles, one above the other, and venerate the Host. God the Father, bathed in celestial glory, blesses the crowd of biblical and ecclesiastical figures from the top of the composition. Immediately below, the resurrected Christ sits on a throne of clouds between the Virgin (bowed in adoration) and St John the Baptist (who, according to iconographic tradition, points to Christ). Prophets and saints of the Old and New Testament are seated around this central group on a semicircular bank of clouds similar to that which constitutes the throne of Christ. They form a composed and silent crowd and, although they are painted with large fields of colour, the figures are highly individuated.At the bottom of the picture space, inserted in a vast landscape dominated by the altar and the eucharistic sacrifice, are saints, popes, bishops, priests and the mass of the faithful. They represent the Church which has acted, and which continues to act, in the world, and which contemplates the glory of the Trinity with the eyes of the mind. Following a fifteenth century tradition, Raphael has placed portraits of famous personalities, both living and dead, among the people in the crowd. Bramante leans on the balustrade at left; the young man standing near him has been identified as Francesco Maria Della Rovere; Pope Julius II, who personifies Gregory the Great, is seated near the altar Dante is visible on the right, distinguished by a crown of laurel. The presence of Savonarola seems strange, but may be explained by the fact that Julius II revoked Pope Alexander VI's condemnation of Savonarola (Julius was an adversary of Alexander, who was a Borgia).The structure of the composition is characterized by extreme clarity and simplicity, which Raphael achieved through sketches, studies and drawings containing notable differences in pose. References to other artists are visible throughout the composition (the young Francesco Maria Della Rovere, for example, possesses a Leonardo-like physiognomy). But the layout, the gestures and the poses are original products of Raphael's research, which here reaches a degree of admirable balance and high expressive dignity

05433-06glory.jpg	Some panel paintings of the Madonna by Botticelli remain from the years around 1470 which are striking expressions of Botticelli's stylistic development. Two full figure pictures of the Madonna - the Madonna in Glory and the Madonna of the Rosegarden - are in the Uffizi. They represent monumental seated figures filling the entire picture.Mary is enthroned on clouds in a glory of seraphim. The Christ Child, with the cruciform nimbus, is looking towards the observer and raising his hand in blessing. Botticelli has succeeded in expressing the tensions in this theme with sensitivity: the mother, who is fully aware of the Passion her son will suffer, is holding him protectively in her arms

22473-02mad_c.jpg	Against a misty blue sky and dreamily romantic landscape the Madonna appears to a pious friar - probably the client who ordered the picture - and to St Anthony who is commending the friar to the Virgin. This little scene painted in restrained colours but with an animated design does not show anything unusual at first glance, but the more one looks at it, the more likely to discover new elements. First the unusual height of the Madonna holding the Child in her lap strikes attention as compared to St Anthony and the friar at whom she is looking as if they were tiny children. This deliberately archaic approach seems to be in almost conscious opposition to Verrocchio's and Ghirlandaio's rationally constructed compositions. Soon we also discover that, although the hem of her robe rests on the lawn decorated with splendid flowers, the Virgin is not actually in the landscape as in similar compositions by masters mentioned earlier, but is enthroned above it, on tiny clouds.The visionary character of the Madonna is enhanced also by the fact that, whereas she is looking at the two friars in front of her with quiet melancholy, the faces of the two men reveal the intensive inner concentration of people experiencing a mystic revelation.In this picture Filippino actually abandoned the methods of design and aesthetic ideals preferred in this century, or at least by the generation of artists preceding him. He builds his compositions with a loose, informal arrangement of the figures, an arrangement that gives the impression of accidental association, and he often mixes classically regular forms with irregular and even grotesque shapes, solution which sometimes recall idioms of the International Gothic style and sometimes almost those of Mannerism

The painter gives the place as well as the date of the execution of the picture: it is signed Roma 1793. Fagan was based in Rome from 1793 to 1797, however, up to sometime in 1793 Fagan had resided in Naples where no doubt he sketched Lady Hamilton performing one of her attitudes, completing the work later in the year and signing it from Rome.Fagan had portrayed Lady Hamilton as a bacchante in an earlier work now in a private collection.

42642-33faith.jpg	"Signature: Not signed.Provenance: Sale Herman van Swoll, Amsterdam,1699. Sale Amsterdam, 1718. Sale Amsterdam, 1735. Sale Amsterdam, 1749. Private collection, Austria, 1824. Collection D. Stchoukine, Moscow. Art gallery Wachtler, Berlin, as by Eglon van der Neer, with a false signature of C. Netscher. Bought from this gallery by A. Bredius. On loan to the Mauritshuis, The Hague (1899-1923). On loan to Boymans Museum, Rotterdam (1923-28). Art gallery F. Kleinberger, Paris. Collection Colonel M. Friedsam, New York. Bequeathed by the latter to the museum in 1931.An unusually large canvas for Vermeer, this is one of the two known paintings of his that have explicitly allegorical content. Vermeer had converted to Catholicism at the time of his marriage, and this work may have been commissioned by a Catholic institution.The subject matter for this allegory obviously did not suit Vermeer's taste. In the Art of Painting (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), he produced, in spite of the intrusion of iconographic material, a composition that conveyed a psychological approach joined to artistic execution. Even so, it was not really as successful as other works that imply thoughtfulness or meditation.The Allegory of Faith is fraught with details that evidently were prescribed by the spiritual fathers (probably the Jesuits, although the first known owner of the painting was a Protestant) of the composition, but that did not fit into an artistic image with which Vermeer could cope.Hence, we have here an exercise in classicism, of abstract concepts, which led to a mediocre result. The artist's creativity had, in any case, declined by then into a brittle style with no more inner warmth or ability to communicate.Thus, we are in the presence of a rather dry amalgamate, drawn in the main from Cesare Ripa's book Iconologia, to which a large Crucifixion by Jacob Jordaens on the back wall is added as a backdrop. Hence, this allegorical representation of the ""New Testament"" can have served as a didactic introduction to some aspects of the Catholic faith"

23419-thomas2.jpg	This panel, together with three others also in the Edinburgh museum and a fifth in the Vatican formed the predella of an altarpiece.

03688-port_man.jpg	This exceptional portrait depicts a heavily built man, already advanced in years, in front of a pale blue sky with patches of white cloud. Neither his tightly fastened dark olive-green gown with its black fur lining and narrow collar, nor his dark-grey doublet with a glimpse of white-frilled shirt cuffs, nor even his black cap, give any indication of his profession. He might be a cleric, or maybe a scholar, but neither interpretation is conclusive. The conjecture that the sitter in the current portrait was a leading figure in spiritual and moral realms has been fed by the work's immediate, petitioning character: the figure towers up before the horizon, which can vaguely be discerned below his shoulder-line, to rise as it were above us. The panel is unable to contain his broad frame at its two sides. The man stands directly before us, front on, his gaze firmly set on the viewer, with none of the relief that might be brought by a slight turn of the head or body.The painting was formerly attributed to Hans Holbein the Younger, then an anonymous early German painter

39619-1resurr3.jpg	The panel showing St Sebastian (bottom right panel of the polyptych of the Resurrection) was finished by 1520. Jacopo Tebaldi, the representative of the Duke of Ferrara, was so impressed by the painting when he saw it in Titian's workshop that he urged his master buy it.

05244-16eright.jpg	"The right wing of the triptych represents the Hell.In composition, the Hellscape of the right wing of the Haywain stands between the discursive panorama of the Vienna Last Judgment and the monumental simplicity of the Hell panel at Venice. Reminiscent of the latter work, too, are the tall blasted ruin silhouetted against the flaming background and the damned souls struggling helplessly in the lake below, although the foreground is dominated by a new motif, a circular tower whose process of construction is shown in circumstantial detail. One demon climbs a ladder with fresh mortar for the devil masons on the scaffolding above, while a black-skinned companion raises a floor beam with a hoist.The significance of this feverish activity is not clear. Towers abound in medieval descriptions of Hell, but the devils are usually too busy ministering to their victims to engage in such architectural enterprises. However, St Gregory reports a vision of Heaven in which houses were constructed of golden bricks, each brick representing an ""almsdeed"" or charitable act by someone on earth, and were intended to receive the souls of the good. Perhaps Bosch has represented the hellish counterpart of these heavenly mansions, in which avarice, and not almsdeed, supplies the stones. On the other hand, Bosch's tower may be a parody of the infamous Tower of Babel with which men sought to storm the gates of Heaven itself. In this case it would symbolize Pride, the sin which caused the fall of the Rebel Angels and which is exemplified by the worldly prince and prelate and their retinue behind the haywain"

17829-812goya.jpg	This is one of Goya's last female figures, a painting in changing shades of blue. Blue had served as the colour of the Virgin's mantle in art since the Middle Ages. For Goya, blue radiated a positive aura. He rarely used it. The Milkmaid strikes a new note, far from the gloom and despondency of the Quinta del Sordo, the obscurity of the Proverbios and the records of cruelty and madness in his late black chalk drawings. It recalls something of the light and colour of earlier works made in happier times. Goya, according to his friend and fellow exile Leandro Fernandez Mor�t�n, was pleased with 'the city, the country, the climate, the food, the tranquility' that he enjoyed in Bordeaux. A few months later he complains of the artist's 'arogantilla', painting only what takes his fancy and unwilling ever to correct anything that he has painted.Like his cabinet pictures of 1793, The Milkmaid is a subject for which there would be no call in commissioned works and it would hardly lend itself to any correction. According to Matheron, in Bordeaux Goya dispensed altogether with brushes, using instead his palette knife and a rag - 'what matter?'. Here is an example of his very late technique used also in his last portraits in which the brush certainly plays a part; brushstrokes that are separate but that combine to re-create the aged artist's vision - with failing eyesight - of the living woman. This painting more than any other has been taken to show Goya as a precursor of the Impressionists. Goya evidently valued this painting highly as he warned his companion Leocadia Weiss not to let it go for less than an ounce of gold, as she told his friend and fellow exile Juan Bautista Muguiro, when she, in great need, agreed to sell it to him in the year after Goya's death

06515-11misant.jpg	The Dutch inscription reads: 'Because the world is perfidious, I am going into mourning'. The moral of the painting is that such a relinquishment of the world is not possible: one must face up to the world's difficulties, not abandon responsibility for them. The hooded misanthrope is being robbed by the small figure in a glass ball, a symbol of vanity. His action shows how impossible it is to give up the world. The misanthrope is also walking unawares towards the mantraps set for him by the world. He cannot renounce it as he would wish, and he is contrasted with the shepherd in the background who guards his sheep and who is more virtuous than the misanthrope because of his simple, honourable performance of his duties, his sense of responsibility towards his charges

08780-lamenta.jpg	The Lamentation is one of the few large-scale works ascribed to Petrus Christus. Both the style and the growth rings of the oak boards suggest a date of around 1455-60. The painting shows the extent to which the Bruges master, who initially imitated the style of Jan van Eyck, came increasingly in his later career under the influence of Rogier van der Weyden. The main figures clearlyreflect the central figures in Van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross in the Prado in Madrid. At the same time, however, the Lamentation illustrates the limitations of this influence. The sense of drama of the Spanish model is totally missing: the figures appear withdrawn in introspection and contemplation. This effect of serenity may be explained in part by the increasing simplification that characterises the artist's later work. The penchant of Petrus Christus's patron for Stoic ideas may also have played a role here. The large and unusual format, the use of expensive paints and the time-consuming painting techniques all indicate that the panel was not intended for the free market.Compared with Van der Weyden's Lamentation, we notice that more figures are depicted: Mary Magdalen, Joseph of Arimathea, Mary and her two eponymous sisters, John the Evangelist, Christ's dead body, Nicodemus, and a difficult to identify shaven-headed person in the right hand background. One author interprets this figure as the portrait of the purported patron, but there is little concrete evidence to support his view. Maybe he is the husband of one of Mary's sisters, or simply an anonymous bystander. In any event, Petrus Christus appears to have copied this figure in every respect from a Descent from the Cross by the Master of Fl�malle, which once hung in the Sint-Jakobskerk in Bruges, and which is known from a free copy kept in Liverpool. In front, on the rocky ground, we can see Mary Magdalen's pot of ointment. Also present are the hammer and pincers used in the descent, and the three nails with which Christ was nailed fast according to the pictorial tradition. Under the cross lies the customary skull. The tableau is placed in front of a wide landscape, at the back of which the biblical Jerusalem is depicted in the shape of a late medieval Flemish city.

26675-00_4pe2.jpg	David was a shepherd boy who became king of Israel. Much legend appears to surround the biblical account of this complex and many-sided personality. He was a bandit chief, a warrior and a statesman; he made Israel a united kingdom and captured Jerusalem, making it his capital; he was a musician and was traditionally believed to be the author of the Psalms; as a king he was not above intrigue which brought about the death of his mistress' husband. He is important in Christian art not merely as the 'type' or prefiguration of Christ; according to Matthew he was a direct ancestor.The fight of David and Goliath (I Sam. 17:38-51) is often depicted in art. The armies of the Philistines and Israelites were ranged against each other. Goliath of Gath, the Philistines' champion, was over eight feet tall with a helmet of brass, a coat of mail and greaves of brass on his legs; he had a spear like a weaver's beam. David refused the armour Saul offered him (though he is sometimes wrongly portrayed wearing it) and instead took five stones for his sling, putting them in his scrip, or bag. The affair was soon over. The two combatants approached exchanging taunts. David took a stone from his bag, slung it and struck Goliath on the forehead, felling him. He then quickly took the Philistine's own sword and cut off his head. This was the signal for the Israelites to attack and they routed the enemy. The story was made a prefiguration of Christ's temptation in the desert, by the devil, and was used in a wider context to symbolize the victory of right over wrong.Michelangelo's fresco depicts the last moment of the cutting off the head of Holofernes before the soldiers in the background. Out of the darkness a blinding light illuminates the figures of the protagonists - David and Goliath - locked in mortal combat, with a field tent in the background, while, in the corners on both sides, faces of soldiers may be discerned in the shadows.

03308-predell5.jpg	In 1485 Domenico Ghirlandaio received the commission for the Adoration of the Magi for the main altar in the church of the Spedale degli Innocenti. The prior of the church, Tesori, also commissioned the predella with stories of the Virgin and the great cornice of the altarpiece. The latter had been executed by the carpenter Francesco Bartolo on designs by Giuliano da Sangallo, while the scenes of the predella are the work of one of Ghirlandaio's pupils, Bartolomeo di Giovanni; this is confirmed by the records and the workmanship of the fine, slender figures which are characteristic of him.The predella, with the Martyrdom of St John the Evangelist, the Annunciation, the Marriage of the Virgin, the Deposition, the Presentation in the Temple, the Baptism of Christ, the Consecration of the Church of the Innocenti, had been dismembered at the time of the restoration of the great altar (1615). In the 19th century the seven panels were in the Sala delle Adunanze. Later they were reunited with the painting, which was now devoid of Sangallo's fine cornice that was destroyed in the restoration of 1786.The picture shows one of the seven predella paintings

32947-05farne0.jpg	"The Sienese Banker, Agostini Chigi, played a very important role in the cultural and artistic activities which flourished around Julius II. His house was built on the outskirts of Rome in 1509-1510, and was designed as a model of luxury and elegance. He commissioned the most famous artists of the time, Baldassare Peruzzi, Sebastiano Luciani (later called Sebastiano del Piombo) and Raphael himself to decorate it. All three painted frescoes based on classical mythology in Chigi's house (which was later acquired by the Farnese family and came to be known as ""La Farnesina"").As subject Raphael chose a verse from a poem by the Florentine Angelo Poliziano which had also helped to inspire Botticelli's 'Birth of Venus'. These lines describe how the clumsy giant Polyphemus sings a love song to the fair sea-nymph Galatea and how she rides across the waves in a chariot drawn by two dolphins, laughing at his uncouth song, while the gay company of other sea-gods and nymphs is milling round her.Raphael's fresco shows Galatea with her gay companions; the giant is depicted in a fresco by Sebastiano del Piombo which stands to the left of Raphael's Galatea. However long one looks at this lovely and cheerful picture, one will always discover new beauties in its rich and intricate composition. Every figure seems to correspond to some other figure, every movement to answer a counter-movement.To start with the small boys with Cupid's bows and arrows who aim at the heart of the nymph: not only do those to right and left echo each other's movements, but the boy swimming beside the chariot corresponds to the one flying at the top of the picture. It is the same with the group of sea-gods which seems to be 'wheeling' round the nymph. There are two on the margins, who blow on their sea-shells, and two pairs in front and behind, who are making love to each other. But what is more admirable is that all these diverse movements are somehow reflected and taken up in the figure of Galatea herself. Her chariot had been driving from left to right with her veil blowing backwards, but, hearing the strange love song, she turns round and smiles, and all the lines in the picture, from the love-gods' arrows to the reins she holds, converge on her beautiful face in the very centre of the picture.By these artistic means Raphael has achieved constant movement throughout the picture, without letting it become restless or unbalanced. It is for this supreme mastery of arranging his figures, this consummate skill in composition, that artists have admired Raphael ever since. Just as Michelangelo was found to have reached the highest peak in the mastery of the human body, Raphael was seen to have accomplished what the older generation had striven so hard to achieve: the perfect and harmonious composition of freely moving figures.There was another quality in Raphael's work that was admired by his contemporaries and by subsequent generations - the sheer beauty of his figures. When he had finished the 'Galatea', Raphael was asked by a courtier where in all the world he had found a model of such beauty. He replied that he did not copy any specific model but rather followed ""a certain idea"" he had formed in his mind. To some extent, then, Raphael, like his teacher Perugino, had abandoned the faithful portrayal of nature which had been the ambition of so many Quattrocento artists. He deliberately used an imagined type of regular beauty. If we look back to the time of Praxiteles, we remember how what we call an ""ideal"" beauty grew out of a slow approximation of schematic forms to nature. Now the process was reversed. Artists tried to modify nature according to the idea of beauty they had formed when looking at classical statues - they ""idealized"" the model. It was a tendency not without its dangers, for, if the artist deliberately ""improves on"" nature, his work may easily look mannered or insipid. But if we look once more at Raphael's work, we see that he, at any rate, could idealize without any loss of vitality and sincerity in the result. There is nothing schematic or calculated in Galatea's loveliness. She is an inmate of a brighter world of love and beauty - the world of the classics as it appeared to its admirers in sixteenth-century Italy"

02955-rocca2.jpg	Some of the Roman paintings found in the Domus Aurea and elsewhere correspond quite precisely what Vasari and others determined to be the typical features of grotesques. These paintings inspired several ceiling designs 'all'antica' in the first part of the sixteenth century. The desire to revive not only the forms of ancient Roman architecture but also their decoration may help to explain the success of these paintings. In particular, Raphael and the specialist in his workshop, who mastered the genre completely, helped the grotesque style to spread quickly in Rome. This style enjoyed a long-lasting success, which can still be demonstrated even after mid-century. Nevertheless, quite early on the genre developed independently and distanced itself increasingly from ancient models. Later grotesques differed from antique iconography in every respect and retain only the principle of an absurd and paradoxical combination of varied buildings, figures, animals, and plants that Vitruvius criticized.The fresco decoration in the Rocca dei Rossi is an example of the later grotesques. Rocca dei Rossi is a castle located in San Secondo Parmense, northern Italy. It was begun in 1466 on land donated to Giacomo Rossi, a member of one of the most prestigious families in Parma. The stronghold was later turned into a luxurious manor including many beautiful frescoes by the best local artists of the 16th century

30409-port_man.jpg	The extraordinary intensity of the sitter's expression is achieved through the use of a naturalistic language, with no attempt to idealize the face, but one which is at the same time capable of conveying penetrating psychological insight and a subtle sense of disquiet.The panel is an example of the painter's gift as a portraitist and bears witness to a crucial moment in his artistic development, influenced by his study of Raphael and Michelangelo in the months that preceded the dramatic Sack of Rome in 1527			
21185-nativity.jpg	"The work of the Dortmund painter Konrad von Soest should be seen in the context of early Cologne painting. This panel from the Wildung Altarpiece, which is dated 1403 and signed on the reverse side with ""per conradem pictorem de suato"" (by Konrad of Soest, painter), owe their effects to their detail and gently flowing style. The colour contrasts are surprising, with bright gold and yellows as well as deep blues and reds enlivening the scenes. Konrad's Nativity is a successful genre scene, showing Joseph on his knees, his cheeks puffed out as he blows on the fire. As we can see from his face, the world portrayed here is that of the earthy and blunt peasant - people and objects from everyday life provided religious painting with a range of pictorial effects and subjects."

30398-antea.jpg	"Parmigianino painted the portrait of the young lady (so-called Antea) whose identity remains unknown to this day; the name ""Antea"" is a fiction, but will doubtless stick.A story dating from 1671, that it represents Parmigianino's lover, lacks any evidential plausibility. Antea, who is mentioned in the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini, and also in the writings of Pietro Aretino, was a popular courtesan in Rome. It is easy to imagine that the beauty of the young lady gave rise to the speculation that she was romantically linked with her portraitist Parmigianino, not least on account of the fascination exercised by the portrait. However, the painting is likely to have been executed in Parma in c. 1535, the time at which his Madonna with the Long Neck was also painted. Some people have even claimed to see a striking resemblance between Antea and an angel standing next to this Madonna, which suggests that the young woman could have been a studio model, and not just a sitter for her own portrait.The type suggests an official commission. The lady is dressed in elegant clothes, with a yellow dress made of atlas silk. The top is patterned with lozenges, while from the hips down she is wearing a narrow white apron. Over her right shoulder, which curiously is far too broad, she is wearing a pine-marten fur stole complete with head. The animal's nose is pierced with a ring on a chain, which she is holding in her gloved right hand, while the other hand is bare, and is grasping a necklet at stomach height. On her little finger, in her ears and in her precisely styled hair, she is wearing further costly jewellery. There is absolutely no doubt that importance was attached to the depiction of the expensive fabric and of the lady's wealth, so that, if we exclude the courtesan thesis, she must be a lady of rank. Her youth suggests that she was still unmarried"

00342-studiolo.jpg	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments.Alessandro Allori's contributions to the decoration of the Studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio included the Pearl Fishers.Allori was the follower of Agnolo Bronzino, and his style imitates the cool, smooth manner of his teacher. Exquisite male and female nudes, human and mythological, play about on rocks, dive off boats, and bring up shells overflowing with seawater and pearls. Over and over the figures quote Michelangelo (the central nude seen from the back comes straight out of the Battle of Cascina), but only in the most playful way. The echoes of the Deluge on the Sistine Ceiling are transformed by Allori's predominantly pink and blue colouring

21936-2virg_p.jpg	There are two versions of the Virgin of the Rocks, one (the earlier) in the Louvre, Paris and another in the National Gallery, London.The first work that Leonardo executed in Milan is the so-called Virgin of the Rocks, which actually expresses the theme of the Immaculate Conception, the dogma that affirms Mary was conceived without original sin. The name of the picture reflects an iconographical peculiarity: the religious figures are depicted in a rocky grotto, in which they are sitting on a stone floor. The figures are subjected to a strict spatial arrangement called a pyramidal composition. The painting had a considerable influence on Leonardo's artistic colleagues in Lombardy.This canvas was to decorate the ancona (a carved wooden altar with frames where paintings were inserted) in the chapel of the Immacolata in the church of San Francesco Grande in Milan. On 25 April 1483, the members of the Confraternity of the Conception assigned the work of the paintings (a Virgin and Child in the center and two Angel-Musicians for the sides), to Leonardo, for the most important part, and the brothers Ambrogio and Evangelista De Predis, for the side panels. Scholars now feel that the two canvases on this same subject, one in the Louvre and the other in London's National Gallery, are simply two versions of the same painting, with significant variants.The Paris Virgin of the Rocks, entirely by Leonardo, is the one which first adorned the altar in San Francesco Grande. It may have been given by Leonardo himself to King Louis XII of France, in gratitude for the settlement of the suit between the painters and those who commissioned the works, in dispute over the question of payment. The later London painting replaced this one in the ancona.For the first time Leonardo could achieve in painting that intellectual program of fusion between human forms and nature which was slowly taking shape in his view of his art. Here there are no thrones or architectural structures to afford a spatial frame for the figures; instead there are the rocks of a grotto, reflected in limpid waters, decorated by leaves of various kinds from different plants while in the distance, as if emerging from a mist composed of very fine droplets and filtered by the golden sunlight, the peaks of those mountains we now know so well reappear. This same light reveals the gentle, mild features of the Madonna, the angel's smiling face, the plump, pink flesh of the two putti.For this work, too, Leonardo made numerous studies, and the figurative expression is slowly adapted to the program of depiction. In fact, the drawing of the face of the angel is, in the sketch, clearly feminine, with a fascination that has nothing ambiguous about it. In the painting, the sex is not defined, and the angel could easily be either a youth or a maiden

10624-maas.jpg	Holland&#146;s Maas river flows through France and Belgium, where it is known as the Meuse. In Aelbert Cuyp&#146;s radiant vista over the Maas&#146; ocean port at Dordrecht, crowds jam the docks, bugles and drums sound fanfares, and cannons fire salutes. Near the end of the Thirty Years&#146; War, Dordrecht hosted a two-week festival in honor of 30,000 soldiers. On 12 July 1646, a huge fleet of merchant and navy ships set sail to end the happy furlough and return the men home.This vast, sunny composition specifically accents one figure: the young man standing in the dinghy beside the large ship. The anchored ships at the left create a wedge-shaped mass that points toward him, as do some rigging lines. His head lies directly before the horizon, and his stark black outfit is silhouetted dramatically against the palest area of the picture, the morning mist over the far shore. Because he wears a sash with Dordrecht&#146;s city colors of red and white, he may be the festival&#146;s master of ceremonies and is probably the patron who commissioned Cuyp to document this historic event

Bramer was one of the few seventeenth-century Dutch artists who painted frescoes in Holland; none have survived the Dutch climate.Bramer's name has been invoked in connection with Rembrandt's early phase. The question of whether Bramer's early night scenes influenced Rembrandt, or if Rembrandt inspired Bramer's late works, is best answered negatively.

11972-allegr12.jpg	The Villa Allegri was built around 1656 by the Allegri family, nobility from Verona, on the site of a preexisting sixteenth-century structure. It was designed by the Veronese architect and sculptor Giovanni Battista Bianchi. The main hall of the villa and the adjoining oratory was decorated with frescoes by Louis Dorigny in c. 1719.The interior of the oratory is covered in frescoes which are better preserved than those in the main hall. The vault of the central space contains a depiction of Elisha and the Chariot of Helios. To the sides, in ovals edged with laurel wreaths, the figures of the Fathers of the Church are portrayed with almost comic-like wit.In the presbytery, the altar is a good example of trompe l'oeil painting.

23948-miracl7c.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezi�res, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them.This canvas deals with a miraculous event which took place in 1474 during the funeral of a member of the Confraternity who had not believed firmly in the relic of the Holy Cross during his life. The reliquary containing the sacred fragment was taken to the funeral in the church of S. Lio but in the square outside the church it became so heavy that it could not be carried over the threshold. Another cross had therefore to be used while the one containing the Holy relic was entrusted to the care of the parish priest of S. Lio. The presentation of Campo S. Lio is rather static and analytical, the figural rhythms monotonous and the colouring somewhat lacking in richness and interest, but the picture is nevertheless valuable for the evidence it offers of the architecture and costumes of the time

00607-5cumean.jpg	The picture shows one of the three famous women represented in the cycle.The Cumaean SibyI, wrapped in a wide red cloak with metallic highlights on the folds, also represents the same heroic ideals as the commanders. The severity of her face, which is both beautiful and dignified, together with her raised right hand, is the sign of the gravity of her prophecies.A famous collection of sibylline prophecies, the Sibylline Books, was traditionally offered for sale to Tarquinius Superbus, the last of the seven kings of Rome, by the Cumaean sibyl. He refused to pay her price, so the sibyl burned six of the books before finally selling him the remaining three at the price she had originally asked for all nine. The books were thereafter kept in the temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, to be consulted only in emergencies

07655-carlev00.jpg	This marine view clearly shows Carlevaris's debt to the coastal painting of Dutchman Pieter Mulier, better known as Il Tempesta, who worked in Venice.Carlevaris was born in Udine, the son of a painter, sculptor and architect. After being orphaned as a young boy, he moved in 1679 to Venice with his sister. While scholars have presumed a visit to Rome in his youth, this is undocumented and it is far more likely that he remained in Venice and its environs. Nevertheless, his early works do show some knowledge of the Bamboccianti, perhaps through the art of Pieter Mulier and Johann Anton Eismann, both of whom were in Venice during the last quarter of the 17th century

10681-pancraz2.jpg	The panel depicting the Marriage of the Virgin  originally formed part of the high altarpiece painted by Bemardo Daddi during the 1330s for the church of San Pancrazio, Florence. Nearly all of the remaining parts of the altarpiece are preserved in the Uffizi, Florence. The predella comprises scenes from the early life of the Virgin, of which the present panel is the sixth in the narrative sequence. The exact circumstances by which this single panel from the predella became detached are not known. It is notable that all the predella panels still attached to the altarpiece in the Uffizi have rounded tops set into cusped frames, which indicates that The Marriage of the Virgin has been fairly extensively cut at the top. Each of the other predella panels measures 50 x 38,5 cm.The textual sources for The Marriage of the Virgin are the apocryphal Book of James (or Protoevangelicum), known as the Infancy Gospel, 8-9, or, alternatively, The Golden Legend by Jacobus de Voragine. According to these sources, each of the suitors for the hand of the Virgin brought a rod to the Temple to be placed on the altar. Of these it is Joseph's rod that flowers and onto which the Holy Spirit descends, thus indicating that he has been chosen to marry the Virgin. In Daddi's panel the dove can be seen perched on the top of Joseph's rod while the disappointed suitors break their rods over their knees as the marriage takes place

In the artificial light suggesting a room, objects can be sensed in vague contours, but the profile and the hands of the woman holding the cage are surprisingly white against the dark background.

34974-4malles1.jpg	Quite close to M�stair in the Venosta region of south Tyrol lies the little town of Malles with its simple little Benedictine church. In the Carolingian era, this church and the one in nearby Grab�nden belonged together, the church of Malles being affiliated to that of M�stair.A series of paintings were executed in the church around 880, but all that remains in the apses are the figure of Christ standing, of St Stephen and of Gregory the Great. On the narrow strips  of masonry between the apses there is the figure of a priest accompanied by the noble donor, who offers a model of the church to God. Roman influence has been detected in these frescoes, but their execution and treatment of detail differs significantly from the style of the figures in the M�stair church

35506-35mythol.jpg	Chained to a rock, Andromeda, daughter of the King of Ethiopia, was to be sacrificed to a sea-monster. The king had been ordered to make this sacrifice, in order to make amends for the arrogance of his wife, Cassiopeia. As Perseus, who had vanquished the dreaded Gorgon Medusa, was returning home on his winged horse, Pegasus, he caught sight of the chained Andromeda and delivered her from the threat of the monster. Overcome by the beauty of the young princess, her liberator confessed his love: 'Oh, thou deservest not chains such as these but only the bonds that unite passionate lovers' (Ovid).Rubens knew how to translate the popular, widely-known poetry of Ovid into his own special language. On a sea-girt spur of rock Perseus steps towards the royal princess. Dressed in gleaming armour and in the red cloak of the conqueror, he loosens the chains binding the naked maiden, who stands with downcast eyes. Two putti, who, to the best of their ability, are lending a hand, also seem not uninterested in the human side of the encounter; three others are attending to the winged, dapple-grey horse, which is impatiently pawing the rock with its hoof. In the depths of the blue sea the winding coils of the monster appear.Many pictorial themes in Flemish Baroque painting, particularly that of the humanist and diplomat Rubens, are by no means confined to depicting events. The story of Andromeda, for example, was also given political significance, and this kind of material, as an allegory of oppression and liberation in the struggle against enemy powers, was open to a great variety of interpretations. Indeed, the Berlin picture was painted at practically the same time as Rubens' most important work in the field of political allegory, the great cycle of wall-paintings commissioned by Marie de Medicis in Paris in 1622.Rubens treated the same theme in a picture of similar size and design, now in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg

22554-0view.jpg	The picture shows a view into the Strozzi Chapel off the right transept of the church of Santa Maria Novella. In the niche behind the altar table is the tomb of the donor, Filippo Strozzi, above it on the altar wall, an allegorical pictorial program referring to the donor. In the stained-glass window a Madonna and Child and Philip and John as the chapel's patron saints are represented, in the vaulting compartment Adam and the serpent are depicted.The painting on the window wall is nothing at all like the sort of decor that was customary in family chapels. Lacking the bright colours of the stained-glass window and the pilasters on either side, these paintings recede into the background, and the contrast between their monochrome tones and the vivid stories on the side walls makes sit obvious that this pictorial program relates to the iconography of the tombs. Only selected motifs - the angels, for example, and some of the ornamental details - are painted in colour, and these stand out dramatically against the painted architecture. The painted columns on either side of the pointed-arched window stand atop high pedestals that flank the round arch above the tomb. The spandrels above that arch are filled with puzzling paintings in grisaille: in each one a winged youth stands with one foot on a skull and holds out another skull in his hand. Although it is impossible to know exactly what these mean, there is no doubt that they have to do with the presence of the donor's tomb directly below them.The theological virtues Fides and Caritas adorn the pedestals beneath the projecting columns on either side of the window. On the left, two putti playing instruments accompany a seated female figure identified by an inscription as Parthenice.There is a pair of women with masks of tragedy and comedy next to the right pilaster and above the inscription DEO MAX. They can be identified as Muses

10704-belfries.jpg	Naturalism in Germany and northern Europe showed a similar tendency to revise Dutch seventeenth-century patterns, infusing them with the vividness that came from making studies outdoors. The most prominent naturalistic artist in central Germany was the Norwegian Johann Christian Clausen Dahl. Dahl studied at the Copenhagen Academy and then, in 1820, went to Dresden, where he became a close friend of Caspar David Friedrich, sharing a house with him. Dahl adopted much of Friedrich's dramatic imagery, but he worked in an increasingly naturalistic style and even encouraged Friedrich for a time to work outdoors. His pictures have a freshness which brought him considerably popularity in his own lifetime

18561-7eylau.jpg	The battle of Eylau (8 February 1807) in Poland, in which the Russian army was defeated by the French during the fourth coalition, was an extremely bloody engagement, resulting in 25,000 dead and wounded. Napoleon wished to commemorate the victory, and had it made the subject of a competition; but he wanted his humanity to be emphasized, rather than his war-like qualities. The day after the battle, he had toured the battlefield, and was struck with pity at the sight of so much carnage. 'If all the kings on earth could see this sight', he said, 'they would be less greedy for wars and conquests.' This was the moment selected to appear on the official programme of the competition by Vivant-Denon, the Director of the Mus�e Napoleon. Gros, who only competed because he was pressed to do so by Vivant-Denon, was chosen in preference to twenty-five other painters. He received 16,000 francs for the picture, which was exhibited in the Salon of 1808.The Emperor, advancing towards the right, is mounted on a light bay horse, and surrounded by his staff; the cloak and hat which he wore at Eylau were handed to Gros, who kept them till his death. Napoleon is speaking to a wounded Lithuanian, who is moved by the humanity of the victor, and is credited with saying: 'Caesar has granted me life; I will serve you faithfully, as I have served Alexander.' Opposite Napoleon, on a prancing charger, is Murat, whose epic charges transformed an undecided battle into victory; between Murat and Napoleon can be seen Marshal Berthier, Marshal Bessi�res and General Caulaincourt; the young Lithuanian soldier who stretches his arms towards Napoleon is supported by Baron Percy, Surgeon-in-Chief to the Grande Arm�e.In this work, Gros has entirely forsaken classical composition; he has grouped his figures in masses and put striking close-ups of bleeding corpses in the foreground. Although he had never been far east, he has successfully rendered the melancholy of the great wintry plain, the sky leaden with smoke from the burning village.

39262-3vision.jpg	According to the legend, a vision of the Cross brought Peter back to Rome where he was crucified upside down. The four angels, reminiscent of flying figures in Michelangelo's Last Judgment, have partially transparent wings of different colours. They may be the four archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, or they may symbolize the four theological virtues of the Love of God, Charity, Faith, and Hope. The two angels at the top, at least, were probably painted from the same three-dimensional model. Tintoretto intentionally places the golden key of heaven between St Peters thighs. Contemporary comedies leave us in no doubt about the erotic symbolism of the key. It was also the subject of the satirical piece La chiave (The Key) by Tintoretto's friend Anton Francesco Doni. Since Peter is clearly shown here as the first pope, this daring pictorial joke may be seen as evidence of the widespread anti-papal feeling in Renaissance Venice

29597-madonna.jpg	While the chief influence on Alberegno was his experience of the artists working in Padua, Giusto de' Menabuoi in particular, Niccol&#242; di Pietro absorbed influences from even further afield, from Emilia to the Rhineland and Bohemia. The result of this tendency to be interested in what was happening in other cultural centres was that Niccol&#242; di Pietro from 1494 (the date on the Madonna and Child and a Devotee') became the most important Venetian artist working during the period of transition to International Gothic style. In this panel the traditional iconography is respected, even to the miniscule proportions of the figure of Vulciano Belgarzone da Zara who commissioned the painting, kneeling at the feet of the Virgin. But the decorative abstraction of Paolo Veneziano no less than the refined elegance of Lorenzo Veneziano have now gone for ever and in their place is a confident human sense which pervades every figure represented plastically within a composition conceived with precise intentions of rendering a definite spacial entity

21424-birdcage.jpg	Watteau's originality could be copied but not kept alive once Watteau himself was dead. He created a vogue, and this perhaps damaged his own art in the eyes of the next generation. Without Watteau the f&#234;te galante was soon to dwindle to triviality, but his example gave further impetus to the uncoordinated desire for freedom. The difficult balance between decoration and genre was to be held best in France by Nicolas Lancret, immensely successful during his lifetime, but who has perhaps suffered too much in reputation for his proximity to Watteau. Frederick the Great felt none of this, and collected both painters in quantity. Lancret did not attempt any psychological insight, but his eternal charm and his keen eye for contemporary manners led to pictures which occasionally are minor masterpieces.

He therefore has to write down the name of the child. Mary, as the more important saint, is distinguished from Zacharias and Elisabeth by her aureole.The side panels of the St John Altarpiece do not merely show the beginning and end of the Baptist's earthly life.

12534-06siski.jpg	In the second half of the sixteenth century, this painting was in Nuremberg; in 1600, it was part of the collection of Rudolph II. In the 1860s, it reappeared and became the property of the marquis of Lothian of Edinburgh, from whom the Berlin museum acquired it in 1893.In a letter of 23 September 1506 from Venice addressed to Willibald Pirckheimer, in which D�rer writes that he has completed the Feast of the Rose Garlands (N�rodn� Galerie, Prague), he also speaks of having just finished another painting. It would most likely be the Madonna with the Siskin, which the artist brought back to Nuremberg with him. It is astonishing that D�rer does not mention any patrons for this large painting, full of iconographical references. He created it simply by drawing on his own culture and experience.The work is conceived following the dictates of Venetian painting: a monumental Madonna, with the red gown covered by an azure cloak, who sits enthroned before a curtain that is also red, in a landscape pervaded by an especially clear light. A Florentine trademark is represented in the presence of Saint John, even if this detail was also rather common in the Venetian painting by this time. The Madonna's rapt gaze is directed slightly off to the side, while her right hand rests on the Old Testament, in which is prophesied the birth of the new king. She almost unconsciously accepts a lily of the valley (convallaris majalis) from Saint John with her other hand. It is the flower symbolic of the Immaculate Conception and the Incarnation of Christ. The small saint, however, does not look at her; his gaze is directed to Jesus, whose divine nature Saint John is the first to recognize.The infant Jesus is seated in his mother's lap on a rich red cushion. With his right hand, he elegantly lifts a sort of soother - a tiny pouch, apparently filled with poppy seeds, on which babies would suck and be calmed. His left hand, which holds the edge of his little shirt, probably just unfastened (see the open clasp), comes toward his face. In the preparatory drawing, D�rer had represented him with a more solemn expression, while he raised the cross staff; but perhaps in changing the staff, the symbol of the Passion, with the poppy-seed soother - poppy seeds symbolic of sleep and death, if this is actually what it contains - the artist wanted to preserve the childlike manner of the infant Jesus, without altering the symbolism.The siskin - in the place of the goldfinch - perched on his arm points his beak toward his head, where one day the crown of thorns will be; the child smiles affectionately at Saint John below him, to whom a little angel, with a meaningful gaze, is holding the cross staff out to him, though the saint and child do not take notice.To the ruins represented in perspective on the left corresponds a tree in bloom growing from a fallen trunk on the right. The former is a symbol of the fall of the Old Covenant, or perhaps an image of the ruins of David's palace, where, according to the legend, the nativity stable stood. The latter is a sign of life and of the New Covenant.Two cherubs crown the Madonna with a garland of vine shoots of roses, in which are woven a white rose, symbol of her joy, and two red roses, symbol of her sufferings.D�rer's main accomplishment in this painting is in the perfect combination of form and content. Each of the characters expresses his or her own emotion, yet everyone together is composed in a convincing, unified story, the symbols included. Unfortunately, the poor state of preservation greatly disturbs the impression of overall harmony that characterizes the panel

42576-12lady.jpg	"Signature: Signed left on the window.Provenance: It is possible that the painting can be identified with one in the Amsterdam sale of 1696, no. 9, there described as ""A merry company in a room, vigorous and good, by ditto, fl 73."" The suggestion is from A. Blankert. Otherwise, we have the first certain mention of the painting in the Braunschweig catalog, ca. 1711, then again in 1744 and 1776. During the times of Napoleon I, the work was part of his spoils of war, and remained in Paris. Restituted afterward, it was again catalogued by L. Pape in 1846 as by Jacob van der Meer. The attribution to Vermeer van Delft originates with Thor� in 1860.A young woman wearing an elegant red dress is seated in the foreground turned toward the left and looking half-smilingly at the viewer. It is one of the rare instances when Vermeer animates one of his figures with a semblance of expression. She seems to be courted by a fine gentleman, bent over and encouraging the young lady to take a sip from the wine glass that she holds in her hand. Farther back, another. gentleman sits behind a table featuring an exquisitely painted still life of a silver plate, fruit, and white pitcher. The second male figure sits in a pose reminiscent of the Girl Asleep, apparently befuddled by too much wine. A Man's Portrait in the background may be one of the family portraits mentioned in the inventory of Vermeer's widow in 1676, which was part of his stock as a dealer. As to the coat of arms prominently displayed in the window, it belonged to a former neighbours family that used to live in a house next to the Vermeers.The painting has been overcleaned, the last time in 1900, and the sitting man in the background was overpainted during the eighteenth century, as comes out of the descriptions of 1744 and 1776. The room where the artist placed the composition resembles others frequently used by him. Patterns, windows, and walls reappear with minor changes. In this respect, Vermeer did not show much originality. His mastery resides in the delicacy of the execution, the use of light, and the grouping of his figures."

18799-1tobias.jpg	To the middle years of the eighteenth century belongs one of the most remarkable examples of decorative painting in Venice. The ancient church of the Angelo Raffaele (perhaps founded as early as the seventh century) is now rather out of the way and looks dull in its unfinished form, which dates from the sixteenth or seventeenth century. Inside, above the doorway, is a great Baroque organ loft, its parapet decorated with a cycle of seven brilliantly painted scenes. The scenes are episodes from the story of Tobias, who is guided by Archangel Raphael to catch a miraculous fish that will heal his father's blindness. The painting is by Gianantonio Guardi, one of the important artists 'rediscovered' by the twentieth century. Long almost forgotten, the painter here emerges as one of the most imaginative artists of the eighteenth century. Gianantonio trained his younger brother  Francesco Guardi, who collaborated on these decorations.The picture shows the principal scene that occupies the parapet of the organ loft. The centre of the painting is empty, except for a distant landscape. Tobias and his wife, Sarah, are represented on the right in prayer before their nuptial bed

The long torso of Christ hangs listlessly on the cross between the tall figures of Mary and John the Evangelist, but his head is turned upward to the right and from his lips there issues a banderole inscribed ""Eloy, eloy lama sabatini"" (My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me).

05295-01centr.jpg	"The diabolic enterprises represented in the triptych reach a climax in the middle panel. Devils of all species, human and grotesque, arrive from all directions by land, water and air, to converge upon a ruined tomb in the centre. On a platform before the tomb, an elegantly dressed pair have set up a table from which they dispense drink to their companions. Near by, a woman wearing a large headdress and a gown with an extravagantly long train kneels at a parapet to offer a bowl to a figure opposite. Kneeling beside her, almost unnoticed in the midst of this hellish activity, is St Anthony himself; he turns towards the viewer, his right hand raised in blessing. His gesture is echoed by Christ half-hidden in the depths of the tomb, which Anthony has converted into a chapel. The right wall of the sanctuary ends in a decaying tower covered with monochrome scenes. Two of them, the Adoration of the Golden Calf and a group of men making offerings to an enthroned ape, are images of idolatry, while the third, the Israelites returning from Canaan with a bunch of grapes, prefigures Christ carrying the Cross on the outer wings of the triptych.A burning village illuminates the dusky background, probably a reference to the disease of ergotism or ""St Anthony's Fire"", whose victims invoked the name of St Anthony for relief. The ancient association of ergotism with the devil-plagued saint may have been influenced by the fact that one phase of the disease is characterized by hallucinations in which the sufferer believes that he is attacked by wild beasts or demons.The devils who have gathered around St Anthony display a complexity of form unusual even for Bosch. In the group far right, for example, a blasted tree trunk becomes the bonnet, torso and arms of a woman whose body terminates in a scaly lizard tail; she holds a baby and is mounted on a giant rat. Near by, a jug has been transformed into another beast of burden whose wholly unsubstantial rider bears a thistle for a head. In the water below, a man has been absorbed into the interior of a gondola-fish, his hands thrust helplessly through its sides. An armoured demon with a horse's skull for a head plays a lute at lower left; he sits astride a plucked goose who wears shoes and whose neck ends in a sheep's muzzle. All these shifting forms, moreover, display a richness of colour that confers a visual beauty on even the most disgusting shape. A recent, careful cleaning of the triptych, among Bosch's best preserved works, reveals brilliant reds and greens alternating with subtly modulated passages of blue-greys and browns.This convocation of fiends ostensibly illustrates the second attack on Anthony described in the literary accounts; the miraculous light which dispersed the devils on this occasion can be seen shining through one of the chapel windows. But the devils do not seem about to scatter ""like dust in the wind"", as one version has it, nor are they physically attacking Anthony. Instead, their torments must be understood in a spiritual sense. Like the monstrous creatures who confront Deguilleville's pilgrim, they are incarnations of the sinful urges with which Anthony wrestled in his desert solitude. In a drawing made around 1500, Albrecht D�rer similarly illustrated the evil thoughts of a group of people at Mass by means of little devils fluttering about their heads. A number of sins symbolized by Bosch's monsters can be identified, chief among which is Lust. Lust is also represented more overtly in the group of buildings at extreme right, where a monk and a prostitute drink together within a tent; there may be a further reference in the dark-skinned devil in the central group: the demon of unchastity, we are told, once appeared to Anthony in the form of a black boy. It should not be surprising that even the most ascetic saints were susceptible to this particular vice: as the ""Malleus Maleficarum"" informs us, it was through the carnal act that the Devil could most easily assail mankind.Anthony, however, has overcome all his temptations through the strength of his faith. This faith is expressed in his gesture of benediction, thought to be particularly efficacious against the Devil; and the steady gaze which the hermit directs towards us is one of comforting assurance. While the wings of the Lisbon triptych show Anthony tempted and tormented, the central panel thus shows him triumphant"

28506-early15.jpg	Monet landscape experiments in the mid-1860s resulted in some particularly striking works, such as the Garden at Sainte-Adresse which he painted in 1867 near Le Havre. In this work he abandoned the contrasts and somber tones of his early years in favour of a juxtaposition of bright fresh colours (greens, reds, blues) in a tiered composition with an unusually high horizon such as he might have found in Japanese prints.The picture is rendered in dazzling colour. Monet's father and aunt are seated in the foreground facing the sea. His cousin is seen standing with a man, possibly her father, in the middle ground. The direction of the sun tells us that it is mid-morning; the gladiolas tell us that it is mid-summer. The raised vantage point of the picture - Monet was painting in a window on the second floor - divides the composition into three horizontal registers that seem to rise parallel to the surface of the canvas rather than recede into space

34196-s_andrew.jpg	The Apostle St Andrew, Peter's brother, preached to the Scythians, that is the inhabitants of the region around the Black Sea; in this way he became the apostle of Byzantium and later of the Russian Empire. According to medieval legend he was crucified on two beams joined together in the form of an X; thus what has come to be known as the cross of St Andrew found its way into the nag of the Tsars' army and also the Union Jack.In this painting, as in his most famous picture, The Martyrdom of St Bartholomew now in Madrid, Ribera chose the most dramatic moment of the cruel event: the moment before the crucifixion when the saint still had the chance to choose between apostasy and martyrdom. In dim, cave-like surroundings, the saint is depicted in silent debate with a priest who holds up a pagan idol. The body of St Andrew is strongly illuminated in contrast to the rest of the picture thus emphasizing the saint's decision; this is primarily conveyed, not by the expression on his face, but by the convulsive tension of the muscles of his enfeebled body, the involuntary movements of a man who in his mind is resigned to death: he throws back his arms to assist his executioners

00090-deadbird.jpg	In addition to fruit and flower still-lifes with cool colour harmonies, van Aelst also enjoyed painting elegant hunting weapons and dead animals placed in a dark corner by a wall for rich clients. One example is this still-life.A dead partridge is hanging by its leg from a piece of string. Its wings and feathers, which are grey with brownish patches, open up towards us at the bottom like a fan. The fly on the light-coloured feathers has an illusionist effect: disproportionately large in size, it belongs to the realistic level of the picture rather than its fictitious one, so that the viewer is given the impression that a real fly is crawling across the painting. The bird's head has been pressed slightly towards the middle by the blue hunting bag with the golden fringe and the adjustable shoulder strap which is lying on the stone shelf. Beside the partridge a hunting horn, also adorned with tassels, and a powder bottle have been hung up. The shiny, metallic grey of the hunting horn has been painted by the artist with a highly sensitive eye for the different hues of the bird's fluffy, grey feathers on its breast and as a contrast to the grey of the wings which merges into white towards the middle.But, although the bird has been rendered with almost unsurpassable precision, it has an odd abstract quality. It seems as if, in its material consistency, it had undergone a synthesis with the implement of civilization by which it was pursued - as if it was no longer merely part of nature and a victim, but an aesthetically refined and ennobled form of existence.

03433-04garden.jpg	"The Arcadian scene is dominated by the bright sky of early morning above the distant mountains, the lush vegetation, the clearings amidst the woods, verdant bushes, trees, plants, flowers, and farmyard animals: a goat, a rooster, a rabbit, lambs, and many birds above. There is even a peacock in the predominant position, turned toward the future, to the right, which undoubtedly alludes to the immortality of the first human beings before original sin, and a lizard (not a symbol of vanitas as has recently been proposed), lying in the traditional manner, with its head to the east - the sun is rising in that direction above the far-off Monte Grappa in the background. The presence of the human beings appears to be a secondary element, whose emblematic significance is left to our imagination. Nothing concrete, no attribute reveals the identity of this couple half-concealed among the trees and the rolling ground. The man, in a prominent position, bends over the woman, perhaps to receive the fateful request.The delicate poetry of this ""genre"" - painting, whose evolution was greatly influenced by the works that Jacopo produced in the early 1570 - which is the presumed date of this painting -, was later spread widely by his studio. It is not impossible that his son Francesco may have played a part in the execution of the landscape of this painting, for which Jacopo had made a preparatory drawing in sanguine, now in Berlin, of the two figures"

37206-maesta_0.jpg	The picture shows a view of the Sala del Mappamondo (formerly known as Sala del Consiglio) with the imposing fourteenth-century Sienese painting of the Maest&#224; by Simone Martini on the east wall of the principal council hall of the Palazzo Pubblico. The Sala del Consiglio was constructed between 1304 and 1310, as part of the upper story of the central wing of the building. The first frescoes were executed soon after it was completed. The first version of the Virgin with Child Enthroned between Saints and Angels was completed in June 1315. Six years later the heads and  in some cases the hands of eight figures were entirely redone. The reasons behind this intervention are not known.Damage to the fresco over time was caused by the storage of salt in basement rooms beneath the fresco. Moisture carried the salt up through the inner walls of the building and caused crystals to form beneath the surface of the paint.

05254-10deathm.jpg	"That man persists in his folly even at the moment of death, when the eternities of Heaven and Hell hang in the balance, is the subject of the Death and the Miser. The dying man lies in a high, narrow bedchamber, into which Death has already entered at the left. His guardian angel supports him and attempts to draw his attention to the crucifix in the window above, but he is still distracted by the earthly possessions he must leave behind; one hand reaches out almost automatically to clutch the bag of gold offered by a demon through the curtain. Another demon, delicately winged, leans on the ledge in the foreground, where the rich robes and knightly equipment probably allude to the worldly rank and power which the miser must also abandon.The battle of angels and devils for the soul of the dying man occurs also in the Prado ""Tabletop"" (where the traditional figure of Death armed with an arrow likewise appears), and both scenes reflect a popular fifteenth-century devotional work, the Ars Moriendi or Craft of Dying, which was printed many times in Germany and the Netherlands. This curious little handbook describes how the dying man is exposed to a series of temptations by the demons clustered around his bed and how, each time, an angel consoles him and strengthens him in his final agony. In this book, the angel is ultimately successful and the soul is carried victoriously to Heaven as the devils howl in despair below. In Bosch's painting, however, the issue of the struggle is far from certain. An opened money chest can be seen at the foot of the bed, where an elderly man, perhaps the miser shown a second time, places a gold piece into a bag held by a demon. He seems little concerned with the rosary hanging from his waist"

33572-102portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 123.Titus (1641-1668) was the last child born to Saskia and the only one to survive infancy. As with Hendrickje, there are no documented portraits of him, but about four or five portraits of the same boy are known, painted between 1655 and about 1662, and it would be unreasonable to doubt that they represent Titus. Rembrandt also made a number of drawings of him and may have used him as a model for religious pictures. Titus himself grew up to be an artist and several of his drawings have been identified. Titus could have enjoyed a comfortable life. After the settlement of Rembrandt's bankruptcy and his reaching the age of legal majority, the courts paid him nearly seven thousand guilders from Saskia's bequest. From 1660 he acted jointly with Hendrickje as his father's dealer but he died as a young man in 1668, the year before Rembrandt himself.The present picture was painted at the time of Rembrandt's bankruptcy, when Titus and Hendrickje Stoffels were administering the sale of his pictures.

10649-05csont.jpg	"Csontv�ry was about 50 years old when he painted this picture. His style was changing at that time: objective portrayal of nature was substituted  by naive expressionism. He was in search of grandiose motifs of nature and history where grandiosity was not only a tool of expression, but a symbolic meaning as well.The picture shows a small town at the foot of Mount Vesuvius. There are houses on the right, a bay on the left and Mount Vesuvius in the background. Water fills the picture up to two thirds of it. Water which appears to be calm has wild crests along the shore. There is a long breast-work along the road, projecting a sharp shadow on the cobble stones of the road. A cart with a donkey is standing crosswise on the road as if the animal had jibbed on seeing the wild waves. The waggoner is sitting indifferently in the driver's seat. A man is standing with his back to the load that is on the cart. A horse can be seen on the side of the picture. A figure is standing on the balcony  of a house and is keeping watch. A cyclist can be seen somewhat away from him, his shadow is projectedon the wall. There is one more figure  in the picture: a man sitting in  a boat. There are no more signs of human beings around. The line of workshops and factories is continued by houses. The shape of the cloud follows the direction of the smoke. Two sailboats are gliding towards the coast one of which has the words, ""Castellammare di Stabia, 1902"" written on it.The balance of the picture, the unity of town and nature, water and hill are perfect. The colours of the picture are bright. Houses are orange and pink, the water is royal blue and white. The sand is black with a strip as red as lava. The sailboats are orange and purple. The sky is a mixture of blue, grey, light green and greenish pink. One cannot help feeling the elementary power of nature. View becomes vision"

13079-parisnow.jpg	Edelfelt painted this canvas from the window of his suburban studio in 1887. The view, though it has a flavour of the fortuitous, is deliberately, tautly structured, and the subject, though scarcely oriental, is yet done '&#224; la japonaise.' The lane crosses the image and the real space toward the horizon, its course rhythmically underpinned by trees and, further off, carriages and a tram. In the foreground, a snow-covered rooftop is cropped by the right edge. The shadows of this and the neighbouring building (from which Edelfelt is presumably viewing the scene) join the shadows of the trees to establish a contrapunctal diagonal dynamic.

39584-1assunt0.jpg	"Titian worked on this huge altarpiece for more than two years from 1516 to 1518. It has to be seen as a milestone in Titian's career establishing him as a more universal artist who drew inspiration from outside the confines of Venice. Indeed the powerful figures of the Apostles reflect the influence of Michelangelo, whereas the painting demonstrates clear iconographical similarities with the works of Raphael. Above all, what emerges most strongly in the assumption is Titian's desire to break definitely with the traditions of Venetian painting in order to arrive at a synthesis of dramatic force and dynamic tension which will become from this moment on the most obvious characteristic of his work.The picture is composed of three orders. At the bottom are the Apostles (humanity), amazed and stunned by the wondreous happening. St Peter is kneeling with his hand on his breast, St Thomas is pointing at the Virgin, and St Andrew in a red cloak is stretching forward. In the middle, the madonna, slight and bathed in light, is surrounded by by a host of angels that accompany her joyfully hailing. Above is the Eternal Father, serene and noble majesty, calling the Virgin to him with a look of love.The painting is signed as ""Ticianus"" low down in the middle of the picture"

08203-trent_co.jpg	This fresco was painted by Pasquale Cati da Iesi, a pupil of Michelangelo. The represented Council is sometimes called the Tridentine Council, after the Latin name for the city, Tridentum. The coat of arms on the left wall behind the cardinals in red is that of Pius IV, the pope at the time of the closing of the Council.Long after the closing of the Council of Trent its importance was underscored in a didactic and journalistic fresco painted as part of an otherwise elegant and classicising decorative program for a chapel in Santa Maria in Trastevere for one of Rome's leading churchmen, Cardinal Marco Sittico Altemps. Participants in the Council session are spread row upon row across the top of the composition, their faces directed forward or turned in profile as if to record as completely and accurately as possible the individual members. At the lower right of this pictorial chronicle of the event, however, allegorical personifications of the virtues crown a figure representing the Roman Church with a papal tiara. A globe at the lower left shows Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia. Thus the Church appears not only victorious, but extending far beyond Europe, where Protestantism had recently made such dramatic inroads

17259-auvers19.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 765, JH 2029.Auvers had also been the home of a French painter of the generation before the Impressionists, Charles Daubigny. Van Gogh planned to paint a homage to the artist, who had figured so powerfully in his 'mus�e imaginaire' for the last two decades. He painted Daubigny's house and garden twice on a horizontal canvas; one of these versions was going to be sent to his brother Theo in Paris as one of a trio which would convey to that harassed city dweller the calm and restorative forces of the countryside.This unusual square canvas was possibly a study for those later versions. The format has the effect of precipitating the spectator into the garden and its riot of unkempt fertility. Yet the scale of the painting is such that the house itself seems very distant, almost screened off by the rows of trees, closed in on itself by its shuttered windows. This disordered space and uneven paint surface are none the less evocative. Van Gogh has almost used an Impressionist technique and palette to portray the garden of an artist who had been a bridge between the school of Barbizon and the early Impressionists. It was of Daubigny's work of the late 1860s that a critic loudly complained at the lack of finish, the sketchiness: his paintings were too impressionistic

39462-02esther.jpg	The subject of the picture is taken from the Book of Esther which exists in two versions: the first of Hebraic origin as part of the Old Testament and the second of Greek origin in the Apocrypha. It is the second more emotional account that seems to have been known to Tintoretto. He has depicted the dramatic moment (15:2-16) when Esther, the Jewish queen of the Persian emperor, Ahasuerus, intervenes on behalf of her people in Persia who were threatened with death in a proclamation issued by the chief minister, Haman. Esther attended the court in regal dress in order to appeal to Ahasuerus. 'But as she was speaking, she fell fainting. And the King was agitated, and all his servants sought to comfort her' (15:7). Ahasuerus stands on the left at the top of the flight of steps at the foot of which Esther kneels, supported by her entourage. Following this intercession and further deliberation Ahasuerus overrules Haman, who was himself hanged as a consequence of his ill-judged policy. The story of Esther was often treated as a prefiguration of the role of the Virgin in the Last Judgment.On stylistic evidence the painting can be dated to the second half of the 1540s, close to the Last Supper of 1547 (Venice, San Marcuola) and the Miracle of Saint Mark of 1548 (Venice, Accademia). During the 1540s Tintoretto displayed a close interest in Central Italian art, particularly the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, which he probably knew through such secondary sources as prints. As a result Mannerist concepts were grafted onto the Venetian training that Tintoretto received in the workshop of Bonifazio de' Pitati. The tall swaying figures and operatic gestures bespeak Central Italian influence, while the warm flesh tones and rich colouring attest the artist's Venetian origins. The conflation of these two aspects became the basis of Tintoretto's mature style.The composition of Esther before Ahasuerus is dependent in a general sense upon the cartoon by Raphael of the Sacrifice of Lystra, a preparatory drawing for the tapestries in the Sistine Chapel, but the stooping figure on the far right fits more easily into the context of Raphael's School of Athens in the Stanza della Segnatura. The male head at the right edge towards the back, looking out of the picture, may possibly be a portrait of Pietro Aretino, one of the greatest writers of the Renaissance, a friend of Titian and an early patron of Tintoretto. The scale of the painting accords with many of Tintoretto's undertakings dating from the 1540s including the scenes from the life of Saint Mark (Venice, Accademia) executed for the Scuola Grande di San Marco. The free handling of Esther before Ahasuerus is also typical, and several changes were made to the figures by the artist as he worked on the canvas, creating the effect of improvisation

With their graduated greys, these works - sometimes called 'witjes', in a pun on the name Wit, meaning white - imitate stone bas-relief. The theoretical architectural function of the works is clearly expressed in their organisation as niches with a stele in each.The divinity appropriate to each of the seasons is represented by a bust on a plinth, while a small crowd of putti make merry play with the god's attributes.

00532-2east0.jpg	"The subject of the east wall, which unfolds in several registers and stages has been given many different names. Since the 16th century it has usually been known as ""Ecclesia militans"" and ""Ecclesia triumphans."" More recently it has been described as the ""Via veritatis,"" the Church as the Path to Salvation. In addition to the idea of making the observer aware, via images, of the official church and its institutions as the true path to salvation, the intention was also to emphasize, among the institutions of the Church, the Dominican order and its work.The sequence of pictorial motifs begins in the lower left quarter of the image with the depiction of Ecclesia in the form of a large church building patterned after the Florence Cathedral. In front of the side wall of the Cathedral, we can see the hierarchic order of the medieval society: the Pope, at his left the Emperor and King, a prince, at his right the Dominican general and a bishop. Before them are the friars at the left and laymen at the right; then noblemen and knights, merchant, scholar, finally women and the lower ranks of the society. The basilica in the background is the symbol of the Church. The prevailing opinion in the literature is that Urban V is to be recognized in the figure of the pope and Charles IV in the figure of the emperor, Gil de Albornoz in the cardinal, Peter I of Cyprus in the king. Lying at the feet of the pope are several sheep, in front of the sheep, and watching over them, are black-and-white spotted dogs, the 'domini canes' symbolizing the Dominican friars. On the right side of the picture St Dominic is preaching, St Thomas Aquino debating the heretics, St Peter the Martyr signaling the dogs to tear the heretics to pieces. Above these scenes there is the happy world of music and dance.Above the east wall in the vault cell, Andrea painted a free copy of the famous mosaic by Giotto known as the Navicella, from the Old St. Peter's"

43980-2sevens.jpg	Rogier's task was to show both the seven sacraments and also the Crucifixion, the fundamental act of redemption. He solved the problem by moving the separate actions into a basilica with three naves. The side aisles provide room for the sacraments, shown simultaneously; only the most important sacrament, the Eucharist, is taking place in the central section at the rood screen altar, which means that it is directly related to the sacrificial death of Christ.While the actions of the sacraments are accommodated in a church with some degree of plausibility - though a dying man's bed would not, of course, have been moved to a chapel for extreme unction - the Crucifixion group belongs to a different plane of reality, as is made abundantly clear by its much larger proportions, suitable to its significance.At the same time, the artist tries not to make the difference seem disruptive, and with that end in view confines the large figures mainly to the central panel. If we look past them to the priest at the altar in the background, the difference of scale could be taken as perspective reduction. It is only to the left, where the cloak of the large figure of a female saint almost touches the priest performing the sacrament of baptism, that the problem seems not to have been entirely solved.The church building with the sacraments here represents the church as an institution, but in its architectural details it echoes St. Gudule's, Brussels' main church. The idea for the view into the depths at the back, seen at a slight angle through the central nave, came from a work by Jan van Eyck, his Church Madonna, probably painted around 1440 and now in the Gem&#228;ldegalerie in Berlin. Working from this model, Rogier produced one of the most lofty and convincing church interiors of Early Netherlandish painting.With its view into the main nave and side aisles, its great depth, and the more or less appropriate proportions of the smaller figures, it was the inspiration behind countless later Netherlandish church interiors, in particular those painted around 1600 in Antwerp. In dividing up the areas of the painting, Rogier - again following Jan van Eyck, in this case his Madonna Triptych now in Dresden used the triptych formula, but made some unusual changes to it: the lower side panels can no longer be folded over the central panel, and instead the outline of the entire altarpiece matches the building it portrays, with the inverted T shape also echoing a common feature of Netherlandish altarpieces, the raised center panel. Perhaps this idea came from carved retables, which are frequently raised in the middle and employ motifs of sacral architecture in their structural design

As the king declined to purchase them, owing to the exorbitant price she demanded, she burned three and offered the remaining six to Tarquin at the same stiff price, which he again refused, whereupon she burned three more and repeated her offer. Tarquin then relented and purchased the last three at the full original price.The sibyl is wearing a terracotta-red dress with the yellow sash draped over her left arm, gently waving.

15549-2visita.jpg	"The right wall in the Tornabuoni Chapel tells the story of Saint John the Baptist in the same seven picture areas as the story of Mary is told on the wall opposite. The two stories meet in the fresco the Visitation, in which the two mothers-to-be, the young Mary and the aged Elizabeth are depicted.The Visitation is the second scene in the lower section of the right wall.  ""... the Visitation of Our Lady and St Elisabeth, accompanied by women wearing the costumes of the day..."" (Vasari). Along with the two birth scenes, the Visitation is one of the most important pictures in the entire chapel. The meeting of the Virgin Mary and Saint Elizabeth in the centre was painted quickly and easily. Ghirlandaio then uses the remaining space to display a little of everything that his brush is capable of producing and that his donor stipulated in the contract: landscape and cities, animals and plants, a bold use of perspective, classical buildings and reliefs and, not least, portraits of noble and beautiful women.Various women spectators are witness to the event. Among them Vasari identifies ""... Ginevra de' Benci, a most beautiful girl"". The person he refers to is standing on the right, though it is much more probable that she is actually Giovanna degli Albizzi, who in those very years became the wife of Lorenzo Tornabuoni.In the background of the visitation, side by side, are features that reflect the two sources of Ghirlandaio's pictorial inspiration: classical art and Flemish painting. On the right, the classical era is represented by a building with sculptural decorations, while the men seen from behind, leaning over wall, are derived from superb Flemish paintings - Jan van Eyck painted such figures in the background of his so-called Rolin Madonna about 1436 (now in the Mus�e du Louvre), and Rogier van der Weyden created a variation on this idea in his Saint Luke Painting the Virgin (now in Boston). Ghirlandaio uses the classical reliefs and the strong horizontal line of the wall below them to establish a link with the next scene, the Angel Appearing to Zacharias"

27168-ophelia.jpg	Millais painted the landscape for this painting beside a stream while staying with his friend William Holman Hunt on a farm in Surrey in the summer and fall of 1851. The time Millais took over this painting from the life enabled him to represent the flowers he required (some of which were cited by Shakespeare in Hamlet and some of which were included for their symbolic value), even if they did not all bloom at the same time. Following a method much used by the Pre-Raphaelites, Millais painted the figure in his London studio during the following winter.

40107-drinking.jpg	In the 1620s in Roman circles, a definite change came about in the subject matter of musical paintings. The representation of figures playing musical instruments in 'cultivated' domestic interiors (the direct descendants of Caravaggio's Lute Player and Musicians) disappeared. Within the space of a very few years they were replaced by large numbers of representations of concerts in public places and 'popular' locations.These themes were explored by Tournier in such works as the Drinking Party with a Lute Player, in which boisterous groups of figures sit around a table in a tavern. This painting is a perfect example of what the seventeenth-century German historian Joachim van Sandrart called the 'Manfrediana methodus', or Manfredi's method. According to Sandrart, Bartolomeo Manfredi's followers preferred to paint 'soldiers who played cards, musicians who played various instruments and other similar half-length figures.' Tournier, one of the most important French Caravaggist painters active in Rome during the 1620s, was undoubtedly ruments in 'cultivated' domestic interiors (the direct descendants of Caravaggio's influenced by Manfredi.

12594-5_4holy1.jpg	Having rejected the Gothic art and philosophy of Germany's past, D�rer is the first great Protestant painter, calling Martin Luther &#147;that Christian man who has helped me out of great anxieties&#148;.These were secret anxieties, that hidden tremulousness that keeps his pride from ever becoming complacent. Although there is no reason why any Catholic artist should not have painted The Four Apostles, nor why such an artist should not equally have chosen first John and Peter (indisputably biblical Apostles), then Paul and Mark (mere disciples, not ordained by Christ in the Gospel story, though they were great preachers of the Word), it strikes a definitely Protestant note.At the bottom of the two panels are lengthy Biblical inscriptions, selected by D�rer and copied by the calligrapher Johann Neud�rffer. These begin with a warning against the dangers of false prophets: `All worldly rulers in this threatening time, beware not to take human delusion for the Word of God. For God wishes nothing added to his Word, nor taken from it. Take heed of the admonition of these four excellent men, Peter, John, Paul and Mark.' There then follow German texts from the four men, taken from Luther's translation of l522. D�rer's inscriptions mark his belief in the Reformation, but he expresses concern about the dangers of religious fanaticism.These four embody the four temperaments: D�rer had a consistent interest in medicine and its psychological concomitants, since in some way he found humankind mysterious, and it was a mystery he pondered constantly

40014-2mouli10.jpg	La Goulue, actually called Louise Weber (1870-1929), was the most successful can-can dancer of her time. She appeared at the Moulin de la Galette, the Alcazar, the Elys�e-Montmartre, the Jardin de Paris, and later especially at the Moulin Rouge, frequently with Valentin the Contortionist, her partner in the quadrille. She was given her nickname as a result of her uncontrolled appetite (goulue = greedy).La Goulue was from Alsace and worked as a washerwoman until she was discovered. When she became too fat and the Moulin Rouge withdrew the quadrille, she opened her own show booth, which Lautrec decorated in 1895. After that she worked as a flower-seller, in 1896 even as a wrestler at the Neuilly fair, and as an animal tamer. Later she lived with a man who exhibited her as a fairground curiosity in 1925. She deteriorated even more, survived for a time as a maid in a brothel, and died lonely and impoverished

13271-jupiter.jpg	The subject of the painting is taken from Ovid. Diana's nymphs were expected to be as chaste as the goddess herself. One of them, Callisto, was seduced by Jupiter who first disguised himself as Diana in order to gain the nymphs presence. Her pregnancy was eventually noticed by Diana who punished Callisto by changing her into a a bear and setting the dogs on her. But Jupiter snatched her up to heaven just in time.In this painting Jupiter embraces the naked reclining nymph. His eagle in the background has a thunderbolt in its beak. Callisto is not yet aware of the fate that awaits her. Supporting herself on the quiver, she rises from her rest and looks directly at Jupiter, whom she believes to be Diana. What is unique in Everdingen's painting is that Callisto glances up and sees Jupiter as Diana, whereas we see him as himself, wearing the crown of the gods.

03755-014cruci.jpg	The Mantegnesque phase of Bellini's art comprises several fundamental works. Included among them is the Crucifixion, formerly in the Venetian church of San Salvador and now at the Museo Correr in Venice, whose chronological placing before or after the Transfiguration in the same museum has been a matter of some uncertainty. Certainly the anguished forms and the meticulous arrangement of the elements are characteristics that appear extremely early in Bellini's career, and for this reason the period between 1455 and 1460, coinciding with the presence of Mantegna in Venice, seems the most plausible moment for its execution.The landscape, though vast and expanded, is not yet conceived as a whole, but built up piece by piece according to an intellectual model filtered through the Gothic experiences of Jacopo. The figures are slender and sharply defined, and their grief, sculpted with raw pathos in the half-open mouths and extreme boniness of the bodies, is echoed in the stony contours of the landscape. These features had led some scholars in the 19th century to ascribe the painting to the Ferrarese artist Ercole de' Roberti.

19928-13anthon.jpg	The identification of the 54-year-old man is not completely certain, but it is most probably Duke Antony of Lorraine (1489-1544), who was a commander in the service of the French king, Francis I. The portrait is dated to the last year of Holbein's life on stylistic grounds. As the duke was not in England at that time, the picture could be based on a study that the painter did in 1538, when he also painted a portrait of Duke Antony's daughter, Anne.Whoever the subject may have been, Holbein's extraordinary control over the execution and painting invests the work with an authority that not even Jean Clouet at the French court could match. The linearity of the black cape is prefigured in a number of works from the 1530s, but without the soft richness shown here. The texture of the sleeve rivals Titian's achievements. There is an absence of the sheen Holbein prefers elsewhere, as on velvet or satin. Surrounding imagery is kept to a minimum and nothing detracts from the bold monumentality of the figures. The thin gold of the inscription echoes the sprigs of gold in the cap. This refinement vanished from English painting after Holbein's death and the vigour and often splendid coloration that marks native production for the rest of the century could not encompass the truth to appearances which Holbein had made his goal

38960-05worshi.jpg	Giambattista Tiepolo collaborated with the Venetian quadratura painter Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna on the ceiling fresco of the nave of the church of St. Mary of Nazareth called the 'Scalzi', completing the work in 1743-45 following the careful preparation of studies and models. The grandiose fresco depicting the 'transportation of the holy house of Loreto' was almost completely destroyed during World War I. The few remaining fragments, such as this 'Worshippers', are enough to evoke the richness of colour and conception of this major decorative achievement.

11371-8delaroc.jpg	Already in 1840 Louis-Philippe had consented to the return of Napoleon's body for a state burial in Les Invalides, thus officially incorporating him into French history. But with this continuing process of rehabilitation came a fresh appreciation of the great man's vulnerable humanity. In 1848 Louis-Philippe's favourite history painter, Paul Delaroche, painted his own account of Napoleon's Saint Bernard crossing. Tired but determined, the guided mule plods on, a bedraggled Napoleon on its back. The contrast with Jacques-Louis David's artifice is extreme, but Delaroche's position was far from hostile. He was fascinated by Napoleon, to whom he bore a strong resemblance, and whose successes and reversals he compared to his own.

00534-2east02.jpg	"The subject of the east wall, which unfolds in several registers and stages has been given many different names. Since the 16th century it has usually been known as ""Ecclesia militans"" and ""Ecclesia triumphans."" More recently it has been described as the ""Via veritatis,"" the Church as the Path to Salvation. In addition to the idea of making the observer aware, via images, of the official church and its institutions as the true path to salvation, the intention was also to emphasize, among the institutions of the Church, the Dominican order and its work.The sequence of pictorial motifs begins in the lower left quarter of the image with the depiction of Ecclesia in the form of a large church building patterned after the Florence Cathedral. In front of the side wall of the Cathedral, we can see the hierarchic order of the medieval society: the Pope, at his left the Emperor and King, a prince, at his right the Dominican general and a bishop. Before them are the friars at the left and laymen at the right; then noblemen and knights, merchant, scholar, finally women and the lower ranks of the society. The basilica in the background is the symbol of the Church. The prevailing opinion in the literature is that Urban V is to be recognized in the figure of the pope and Charles IV in the figure of the emperor, Gil de Albornoz in the cardinal, Peter I of Cyprus in the king. Lying at the feet of the pope are several sheep, in front of the sheep, and watching over them, are black-and-white spotted dogs, the 'domini canes' symbolizing the Dominican friars. On the right side of the picture St Dominic is preaching, St Thomas Aquino debating the heretics, St Peter Martyr signaling the dogs to tear the heretics to pieces.

35010-cremona2.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. He painted the scenes above the next arch, and continued the cycle on the right wall, where he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.Romanino was commissioned for the next four scenes of the Passion on the right wall; he painted in 1519 the scenes Christ before Pilate, Flagellation of Christ, Christ Crowned with Thorns, and Ecce Homo. For these scenes Romanino borrowed motifs from D�rer' engravings. The open brushwork, the atmospheric space, the architecture lined with sculpture, and the profound psychological characterization of the faces are owed to Romanino's study of Titian's frescoes in Padua.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists

00621-09tolent.jpg	Not long after the SS. Annunziata comission, the Opera del Duomo commissioned the monument to the commander Niccol&#242; da Tolentino, which Andrea completed in March 1456. For this painting Castagno had to revert to the monumental and heroic model he had used in the Legnaia cycle. His description of the tense muscles of the horse and the general's furrowed face are very acute naturalistic observations that break the rigidity of that model.A comparison of Andrea's Tolentino with Paolo Uccello's Sir John Hawkwood, painted in the same cathedral several years earlier (1436), is inevitable. While Uccello froze the horse and its rider into a static composition of rigid geometric precision, Andrea expressed through the tension and movement of this fresco all the restlessness and vitality of his spirit.The Monument to Niccol&#242; da Tolentino in Florence Cathedral is the last work by Castagno that still survives; in 1457 he frescoed a Last Supper for the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli, but it has not come down to us

35702-cloister.jpg	Painted around the mid-1650s, The Cloister is one of a group of works directly influenced by Ruisdael's travels around the German-Netherlandish borderlands, the regions of Overijssel and Westphalia. The painting unites a number of painterly and compositional elements that clearly relate directly to Ruisdael's impressions from his journey: the open, generously composed riverscape contains a number of 'non-Dutch' motifs, such as a cloister complex with a ruined tower on the riverbank, the dark, overgrown hill ridge in the background, and the bizarrely shaped, knotty trunks of the ancient trees on the right-hand side of the picture. The pale bark of the dead tree on the right-hand riverbank corresponds to the ochre fa�ade of the ruins, warmly lit by the evening sun. Dark, heavy clouds gather over the hills against the pale evening sky, whose light is reflected by flat areas of the riverbank. The careful, finely detailed work on the foliage, the pure, cool coloration, and the richer and more powerful approach of this picture go far beyond Ruisdael's works from the 1640s.The artist sketching scenery in the foreground of the painting invites the viewer to immerse himself in contemplation at the sight of the genesis and decay of nature and of the achievements of civilisation.

36436-landsc_a.jpg	By the early 17th century, painting had begun to split into a variety of specialist fields. Roelandt Savery, who came from Kortrijk (Courtrai) but worked mostly abroad, was an interesting figure in this respect. Rudolph II of Prague commissioned him to paint landscapes after sketches and drawings made during a journey through Bohemia and the Tyrol. He was fond of picturesque locations and romantic forests and cliffs, like those in the Crab Fishermen. He took advantage of his time at court to study exotic animals in the zoological gardens. The influence of this period continued to make itself felt in his later work, too. Landscape with Animals, with its characteristic, paradisiacal atmosphere is a fine example.

23742-fugger2.jpg	The sitter of this portrait was Ulrich Fugger the Younger (1490-1525). He was born into a family that would soon become one of Europe's greatest mercantile and banking dynasties. His father - Ulrich the Elder - and his uncles Georg and Jacob Fugger together founded a flourishing spice- and textile-trading firm in 1494, which under Jacob's leadership became immensely prosperous by expanding into mining and finance. The young Ulrich traveled widely in Central Europe as a representative of the Fugger firm. His final station in life was the mining centre of Schwaz in Tirol. It was surely in Schwaz in 1525 that Hans Maler painted the present portrait.There is an almost identical other version of the portrait in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York which preceded the present version.Maler's portraits of Ulrich Fugger represent just one part of his more extensive work for the Fuggers and their close associates in Schwaz, made possible by the increased presence of the Fugger firm in the mining town from 1522 onward. It is conceivable that some were used to decorate the family's new residence and office in Schwaz, the Fuggerhaus, completed about 1525-28

08978-00landsc.jpg	This is an early work of the artist, probably from about 1630 before he began the Liber Veritatis.Claude's earliest surviving pictures have usually been dated to around 1630, although he did not begin to keep accurate records until the mid-1630s. By this time he was already mature, and so it is from the evidence supplied by the undated pictures that his first hesitant steps have to be reconstructed. The fact that he developed so rapidly from his first unpromising topographical scenes to become the virtual inventor of the atmospheric and poetical landscape is evidence of his genius. In the early pictures, considerable reference is made to a wide variety of painters, all of them landscapists. By about 1630 an enormous amount of landscape painting was going on in Rome, soon to be increased by the innovations of Poussin and Dughet. Claude therefore had to contend with many other artists working in mature styles, either influencing or ignoring one another. He drew almost casually from this varied background, now leaning on one, now on another, and then discarding them all, to achieve total self-confidence by the time he was thirty-five

03601-50betrot.jpg	In 1518 a new project brought together three Sienese painters, Sodoma, Beccafumi and Girolamo del Pacchia. The new project was a scheme of fresco paintings to embellish the interior of a meeting room belonging to one of the city's oldest confraternities - the Confraternity of Santa Maria degli Angeli della Veste Nera (Saint Mary of the Angels and of the Black Robes). Founded in honour of the Virgin after 1450 the confraternity also adopted Bernardino as one of their saints, adding his name to the confraternity's title. For this reason the room that painters decorated is now known as the Oratory of San Bernardino. Designed as a place where the members of the confraternity would meet to conduct both their collective devotions and their administrative business, the Oratory of San Bernardino offers a rare example of an early sixteenth-century decorative ensemble that has survived in almost its original form.On the side walls of the room there is a series of large-scale fresco paintings separated from one another by pilasters decorated with candelabra motifs. The paintings consist of narrative scenes from the life of the Virgin. Beccafumi had been entrusted with painting the Betrothal and the Dormition.In Beccafumi's painting of the Betrothal of the Virgin, his preference for slender, elegant figurative types that are much less amply proportioned than those of Sodoma and Girolamo del Pacchia is apparent. The elaborately decorated marble doorway in the Betrothal of the Virgin, with its striking frieze and pilaster, together with the circular building behind it and to the left, demonstrate the painter's interest in architecture, both ancient and contemporary, which he could have seen in Rome. Indeed, the circular building bears a strong resemblance to the Tempietto, that was constructed in 1502 by the architect Bramante near the Roman church of San Pietro in Montorio

12503-2lament.jpg	"This panel was dedicated by Albrecht Glimm, the goldsmith, to his first wife, Margareth Holzhausen, deceased 22 October 1500. The D�rerian monogram and the date 1500 had once been on the lower edge of the sudarium.The lamentation scene, composed of nine figures under the cross, occupies almost the entire painting. This scene is framed above by a beautiful landscape in which Jerusalem can be seen off the lakeshore, atop a hill, in the foreground. Behind the city is a mountain peak and a mountain range that disappear into the background. The city, mountains, and lake are flooded with light. A thick blanket of heavy black clouds that thins out just above the lake in the back looms over the mountains. While the presence of the black clouds is justified by the narration of the crucifixion (""and darkness came over the whole land...while the sun's light failed,"" Luke 23:45), and the light is explained by the words of the apocryphal gospel of Saint Peter when he describes the position (""and the sun began to shine again "", 6:21), the Jerusalem that appears in the painting - a city near water, with house, towers, and fortification walls, lying against rocky mountains  - is decidedly an invented, Nordic city, which does not at all reflect the actual appearance, well known at that time, of this blessed city. In the centre, one sees the door that opens into the garden of Gethsemane. A little more ahead, on the right, is the entrance to the tomb in the rock, through which one can spot the uncovered sarcophagus. The first thing that strikes the spectator is the chorale composition of the sufferers around the figure of Christ.One subsequently perceives the landscape, almost as if it were a second component of the painting. At this point, the two components together make the visual field explode.The image of the lamentation is from a Dutch, not a German, tradition. D�rer interprets it in Italian terms, associating, in the composition of the scene, the figures three by three: Nicodemus, Magdalene, and Saint John the Evangelist align themselves in an ascending order under the cross. In the centre, the head of the Madonna, while she wrings her hands, is joined by the heads of the other two Marys, who cry with her, the three representing three ages of life.Last is Joseph of Arimathea, who supports the body of Christ with the sudarium. The image of the body is particularly impressive for the deathly pale colour and for the complete abandon of the lifeless parts. Another Mary stands out for her clothing, fashioned from D�rer's period. She is weeping while holding Christ's hand.Thus, a triad is formed, be it with the head of Christ and the Madonna, or of Christ and Joseph of Arimathea. The impression of these different triads contrasts with the great chromatic variety of the clothing. However, the rhythm that characterizes the harmonious composition of the figures is not to be found in the colours, since the exaggerated dimensions of the ointment vases breaks the regularity of the proportions, which is otherwise fairly consistent.The beauty of the work lies chiefly in the depiction of the individual physiognomies and in the gradation of pain: from Magdalene's tear-stained eyes, to the expression of muted and composed suffering of almost all the rest of the figures, to the absolute desperation, shown by the gesture and wailing of the woman next to the Madonna.The scene with the body of the dead Christ opens up toward the spectator, so that he can directly participate in the lamentation, following the Mary, clad in Renaissance attire, who lovingly clutches the hand of Christ. Since the entire scene is illuminated by a limpid ""new light,"" the suffering of the lamentation is accompanied by a feeling of comfort, a feeling that D�rer makes delicately transpire from the John and Magdalene, whose hopeful gazes are turned toward this light. This, apparently, is the Christian message of the panel. According to an enduring medieval tradition, the figures of the donors are painted, kneeling at the bottom of the scene: on the right, the position of honour, the goldsmith Albrecht Glimm with his coat of arms and two sons; to the left, the late consort with her own coat of arms and daughter. A crown of thorns lies in the middle, between the two groups"

31006-rebecca.jpg	"Piazzetta was the son of a wood carver from whom he inherited his taste for sculpturally solid figures and a wonderful gift for engraving. His career included an unusual episode for a Venetian painter. From 1703-05, in fact, he studied in Bologna with Giuseppe Maria Crespi, being inspired by Crespi's dramatic use of chiaroscuro. Piazzetta was also excited by Guercino's altarpieces with their ""big splashes"" of colour. The immediate effect of these influences was that he developed a dramatic pictorial style with tremendous emotional power.He tended to use strong chiaroscuro, contrasting brilliantly-lit areas and others plunged into shade. His palette contained a lot of muted browns, partly due to which his pictures convey a strong religious feeling. However, thanks to his contacts with Tiepolo (with whom he worked in the church of the Gesuati and who had been at first influenced by him) Piazzetta's work gradually became lighter and more luminous, although he never painted frescos. Even when decorating the ceiling of a chapel (in the church of S. Zanipolo) he painted on canvas. Piazzetta produced many fine secular compositions for collectors. Among these we should mention his famous Fortune Teller in the Accademia in Venice or his Rebecca at the Well in the Brera in Milan. He was also an excellent illustrator and engraver. Finally, Piazzetta played a key role in teaching and was one of the founders of the Venetian Academy of Fine Art"

33952-moses.jpg	At the beginning of the 17th century the followers of Caravaggio and Carracci vied with each other for predominance. Some sought a classical approach and a serene harmony of forms and colours, others were intent on humbly capturing simple everyday life set in a powerful contrast of light and shadow. But there was no hard and fast dividing line between them and even classical painters like Guido Reni in his Moses is influenced by Caravaggio's heroic dramatic style.

37295-50crucif.jpg	The Crucifix from the church of the Misericordia in San Casciano Val di Pesa, first discovered and attributed to Simone in the early years of the 20th century, is undoubtedly contemporary to the paintings described above. Although there is no documentation at all regarding it, some scholars have suggested that it is the Crucifix that Simone painted in 1321 for the Chapel of the Nine in Siena. This theory is not very convincing, however, because if we examine our sources carefully it becomes clear that what Simone painted in that chapel was a fresco and not a panel - a fresco which was then destroyed by a fire. The closest analogies that this Crucifix presents are with the Pisa and Boston polyptychs.

42936-1ceilin.jpg	"The fire in the Doges Palace in 1574 also destroyed the decoration in the Sala del Collegio. Restoration work commenced immediately, and Veronese was commissioned to do the ceiling paintings.The picture shows paintings by Veronese in the gilt wooden ceiling of the Sala del Collegio.The three central panels (Mars and Neptune; Faith and Religion; Venice Ruling with Justice and Peace) are surrounded by eight more canvases of alternating ""T"" and ""L"" shapes containing personifications of the Christian Virtues, interspersed on the longer sides by six more monochrome panels with Scenes from the Greek and Roman History. The allegorical program, the glorification of the ""good governance"" of the Venetian Republic, is clearly defined in the inscriptions that appear in the coffers next to the three biggest canvases: ""Robur imperii"" above Mars and Neptune, ""Nunquam derelicta"" and ""Reipublicae fundamentum"" above and below Faith and Religion and ""Custodes libertatis"" under Venice Ruling with Justice and Peace. The eight figures of the Virtues can be identified by the attributes that accompany them: a dog for Fidelity, a lamb for Gentleness, an ermine for Purity, a die and a crown for Reward, an eagle for Moderation, a cobweb for Dialectics, a crane for Vigilance and a cornucopia for Prosperity. These sumptuous female figures dressed in silks and brocades, splendid in their precious and limpid decorative effects and wonderfully lustrous and transparent colours, almost cancel out the limits of the restricted space to which they are confined by their lavish gilded frames, for they are set against an architectural background that seems to extend from one panel to another, creating a marvelous unity of space.

14949-4arles03.jpg	In the autumn of 1888, van Gogh began a series of paintings depicting the public gardens in Arles, and this is a further instance of Gauguin's choice of the same subject matter, painted in mid-November. However, the treatment is quite different: whereas van Gogh continued to paint from the motif, Gauguin's version is highly stylised, based on the play of geometricized shapes, treated with bold washes of colour. The absence of any horizon or aerial perspective contributes to a flat picture surface, which owes something to the influence of Japanese art. The objects in the background (the pond, fountain and park bench) are seen as if from above whereas the elements in the foreground and middle distance (including the young trees packed in straw as protection against the frost) are viewed as if at eye-level. The woman in the foreground is Madame Ginoux, whom both van Gogh and Gauguin had already depicted. This is one of the works that Theo van Gogh acquired from Gauguin in the winter of 1888-89

Her lament is for lost love, but could equally be for the lost past. Richard had been inspired by the inscription on Valentine's monument, 'Naught is left me, I am myself naught', and he took Valentine's costume from the same source, placing her in a Gothic interior before a stained-glass window whose light is veiled by a green curtain.

38507-montholo.jpg	Of all the French provinces, Burgundy had the most significant cultural history in the late Middle Ages. The capital, Dijon, had been the centre of a glittering court which ruled over what had become, by the middle of the fifteenth century, an empire that included much of the Netherlands. The stability of the region came to an abrupt end with the death of Charles the Bold at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, when Burgundy was immediately absorbed into France. Artistic activity ended equally abruptly, and in the sixteenth century there were no painters of significance in Dijon. In the first half of the seventeenth century only one painter of significance emerged  in the whole of Burgundy - the mysterious Jean Tassel of Langres. He appears to have been influenced by his father Richard Tassel, and until the 1950s the two painters were totally confused with one another.Jean Tassel's art is characterized by bold expressions, cold colour schemes and a generally 'provincial' air which is difficult to define, but in modern terms akin to the wearing of out-of-date garments away from the centre of fashion. Tassel has been left out of anthologies of French painting because his work is so unlike that of his contemporaries, and he is not yet appreciated as a painter of ability in his own right.Tassel produced one masterpiece which must come from the time he spent in Dijon, the Portrait of Catherine de Montholon (the widow of Ren� le Beau, Seigneur de Sanzette; the founder of the Ursulines of Dijon, died in 1650). The sense of grave austerity which pervades the portrait is usually interpreted by French writers as 'classicism' in the broadest sense of the term. What is most striking about the picture is its lack of reference to contemporary fashions, both in art and life. There is an uncompromising power of observation unadorned by artistic clich�s

29833-matthew.jpg	Florentine painter, sculptor and architect, Andrea Orcagna was charged in 1367 by the Arte del Cambio to paint a triptych to hang on a pillar of Orsanmichele's church: it had to represent Saint Matthew, the gild's patron.

03843-134frar0.jpg	"The triptych comprising large sections portraying the Madonna and Child Enthroned (in the centre), Saints Nicholas and Peter (on the left) and Saints Mark and Benedict (on the right) is signed and dated on the central panel. The paintings wooden frame is probably designed by Bellini himself in perfect spatial harmony with the painting. Its pilaster strips illusorily support the ceiling of the open space at sides in which the saints are placed. In the centre, the Virgin, raised aloft by the throne, has a lighted golden apsidiole behind her which recreates the same effect as that in the San Giobbe Altarpiece. On the mosaic that covers it a Latin invocation can be read: IANUA CERTA POLI DUC MENTEM DIRIGE VITAM: QUAE PERAGAM COMISSA TUAE SINT OMNIA CURAE (Secure gateway to Heaven, guide my mind, lead my life, may everything I do be entrusted to your care).Although apparently more ""archaic"" in that it once again follows a polyptychal scheme (possibly on the request of the commissioner), in many respects the painting constitute a further evolution of the San Giobbe Altarpiece, of which it is reminiscent in many ways. Extremely similar, for example, is the figure of the enthroned Virgin, immersed in fine golden dust that is contrasted only by the compact blue colour of the mantle, which in some way isolates her in space. But mostly it is the study of light that continues, in favour of which the merely plastic elements lose their importance, while the question of space, despite the limit imposed by the shape of the triptych, is ingeniously resolved, not only by rebuilding within the painting the unity interrupted by the frame, but also by suggesting at the sides a vast perspective depth by means of a thin strip of landscape"

21790-crusade.jpg	The present decoration of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Palazzo Ducale was realized after the disastrous fire of 1577 during which all the structures of the ship's-keel Gothic ceiling and the wall-paintings were destroyed. An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings. The canvases were dedicated, thematically, to the Glorification of Venice, in remembrance of the numerous military undertakings in the East or on the mainland by the Venetian ground troops. On the ceiling great importance was given to the victories of the Venetian army in conquering the mainland; along the wall to the dispute between Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa, who reached an agreement in Venice with the political mediation of Doge Sebastiano Ziani; and to the events of the Fourth Crusade, led by Doge Enrico Dandolo in the early years of the 13th century.Jean Leclerc's Doge Enrico Dandolo Recruiting for the Crusade belongs to the series on the wall depicting events of the Fourth Crusade. It represents Doge Enrico Dandolo and the Crusader Captains in the Basilica of St Mark swearing loyalty before leaving for the expedition. The painting was designed by Carlo Saraceni and executed by Leclerc after the death of Saraceni.The Fourth Crusade was the first act of an expedition that aimed at conquering the Holy Land. It ended up subduing the revolt of Zara against Venice and taking over the city of Constantinople after a terrible and systematic pillage. Baldwin of Flanders was elected the new Christian emperor. The Venetian fleet was led by the old but still energetic doge, Enrico Dandolo. The event took place between 1202 and 1204

40340-1green.jpg	"In the upper part of this fresco, which has recently been restored and transferred onto canvas, Uccello has painted the Creation of the Animals and the Creation of Adam. Below, we can still see the Creation of Eve and Original Sin. Painted in ""terra verde"" (a special kind of pigment made of iron oxide and silicic acid), which gives the cloister its name, these frescoes introduce us to some of the main features of Uccello's style: the predominant influence of Ghiberti, visible primarily in the austere figure of God the Father, so like the characters on the Doors of Paradise in the Baptistry in Florence, blends here with details that come straight out of Masaccio's painting, such as the drawing of Adam's naked body, or of Masolino's, such as the serpent's head in the scene of Original Sin.The overall construction of the scenes is designed according to very precise geometric plans, so that the outlines at times coincide with the perfect shapes of circles. Blended with this geometric aspect we find elements that belong to the late Gothic, such as the careful description of naturalistic details: the sharp-edged rocks of the desert landscape in the Creation, or the trees laden with fruit and leaves in the Original Sin."

07265-canal715.jpg	In the eighteenth century there were two main pleasure gardens in London - at Vauxhall and Ranelagh. The latter, which was situated in Chelsea, was regarded as the more respectable. Among its attractions was this Rotunda, which served as a public venue for various forms of entertainment. It became a fashionable place to dine, converse and listen to music, and Mozart performed there in 1764. Canaletto shows numerous groups of elegantly dressed figures either gossiping and creating their own amusement, or concentrating on the orchestra at the left.This picture was painted for Thomas Hollis, a significant patron of Canaletto, who owned nine works by him. On the reverse it bears an inscription, which when translated from the Italian reads 'Made in the year 1754 in London for the first and last time with the utmost care at the request of Mr. Hollis, my most esteemed patron - Antonio del Canal, called Canaletto.' It may well be the case that Hollis requested that the canvas be inscribed in this way in order to certify its authenticity

15439-1cercin.jpg	"Ghirlandaio's earliest surviving work can be found in a parish church close to Florence. In 1471, he painted a fresco in a side apse of the small parish church of Sant'Andrea in the town of Cercina. Within the small space of the apse he created an illusory architectural setting consisting of three niches separated by Corinthian pilasters. In the centre niche Saint Barbara is standing on the body of her father, who has been struck down by lightning. On either side of her are Saints Jerome and Anthony. Everything is arranged to highlight the female saint. The gentle colours in which she is depicted, purple and a light, almost violet red, harmonize her with the golden orange of the capitals and upper part of the apse. The large square under her niche is also painted in a reddish brown imitation marble to emphasize the central axis, while the squares on either side correspond to the muted colours of the two hermits.In this fresco, the young Ghirlandaio was playing with illusionistic techniques in order to prove what he and his art were capable of. The shadows cast by the figures suggest they are standing freely in the niches; the figures are not rigid, and their movements and their physical presence expands the space they seem to occupy. Here painting is becoming three-dimensional, the figures free to move.Saint Anthony is marking the outer border of his niche with his staff and is not venturing across it. In contrast, Saint Jerome, cautiously taking a step forward, is feeling his way onto the painted cornice with his bare toes. In this detail the artist is not only creating a spatial effect, he is also adding a tactile element that is reminiscent of Flemish painting - in Jan van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece, painted in 1432, Adam and Eve are taking a step forward in their niches. There is, however, a more immediate model for Saint Jerome's posture and physical stature: a fresco by Domenico Veneziano, painted after 1455, in the Florentine monastery of Santa Croce, in which Saint John the Baptist is depicted in a similar manner.The hands of Saint Barbara's father, who has been struck down for having his daughter killed because of her Christian beliefs, are casting shadows on the cornice underneath. The hands appear to be projecting right out of the niche into real space, an impression that raises the question of whether these figures are painted or sculpted. Such illusionistic methods of depiction lead us to assume that there was competition between the arts. A few years later, Andrea del Verrocchio extended the ""play"" between the internal and external in sculpture on the fa�ade of the shrine of Orsanmichele in Florence, by placing the figure of Doubting Thomas at very front of the niche in which Christ stands"

06902-banquet.jpg	The Dutch genre painting emerged in Haarlem in the first quarter of the seventeenth century. In Buytewech's Banquet in the Open Air all the typical elements of genre are already manifest, even though the painting clearly reflects a transitional style. Transitional it is, not only in the general setting, which is curiously theatrical, but also in its stiff composition. The presentation of the different motives which together constitute the scene is painfully precise and orthodox.On a stage-like floor, marked off from a garden by theatrical architecture, are two groups of people, both consisting of richly dressed ladies and flashy men. On the middle of the floor a table is set. One group is still seated next to the table; the other is standing on the right, displaying themselves and also, one has the impression, the table. Within this setting, two types of symbol have been introduced: symbols of Luxury (among others: the golden vases and decanters, the peacock on the table, the not quite contemporary fancy dress) and symbols of Vanity (the musical instruments on the floor)

11260-107delac.jpg	A spectacular illustration of the enthusiasm aroused amongst the romantic youth by the revolt of the Greeks against the Turks, the Massacre at Chios was directly inspired by the savage Turkish repression of the population of the island of Chios in April 1822. The critics at the Salon of 1824 received this fine painting very unfavourably. Delacroix had been inspired by Constable's Hay-Wain, which was exhibited at the same Salon, reworking the landscape background with a vibrant touch.Horrified by the massacres perpetrated in Greece by the Sublime Porte, Delacroix denounced this crime against humanity - this genocide. His denunciation took immediate form in The Massacre of Chios; his gesture parallels that of his fervent admirer, Picasso, in his representation of the massacre at Guernica. Delacroix depicted a landscape racked with fire, stretching desolately behind a group of prisoners awaiting execution. The Massacre is all but a manifesto in its liberated expression of light and atmosphere through colour; after it, 19th century painting could never be the same again

17750-402goya.jpg	The thirteenth Duchess of Alba was born in 1762, widowed in 1796 and died in 1802 in mysterious circumstances, which gave rise to the rumour that she was poisoned. She was a prominent figure in Madrid society. Goya's relations with the Duchess were such that they have led to the suggestion that she posed for La Maja Desnuda. He stayed with her at her Andalusian estate in Sanl�car after her husband's death and made several drawings of scenes in the domestic life of the Duchess and her household. She is also recognizable in several plates of Los Caprichos and in one unpublished etching, which seems to record an estrangement from the artist. The present portrait was almost certainly painted during Goya's stay at Sanl�car and remained in his possession.The name Alba on the ring on the Duchess's third finger and Goya on that on the downward-pointing index finger are in themselves evidence of Goya's intimacy with his sitter. The inscription on the ground at the Duchess's feet, to which her finger points (only uncovered in modern times), reads Solo Goya, the word solo ('only') strengthening the assumption that they were lovers. The stiff figure with its expressionless face is, however, more like the puppet-like figures of the tapestry cartoons than a portrait of a familiar sitter

Coming from a prestigious family of artists, he was trained by his father Isaack van Ruisdael and his uncle Salomon van Ruysdael. He belonged to the second generation of realistic landscape painters in 17th-century Holland, a generation which gave their landscapes great expressive force and a profound naturalism. He was a prolific artist who painted a wide variety of landscapes: the plains of the Dutch countryside, the dunes, seascapes, marshes, ponds, woods and hills.

21311-02wfleas.jpg	La Tour, as with Rembrandt and Velazquez, made the most creative use of the lessons of Caravaggism. This painting combines chiaroscuro and candlelight with an uncompromising realism, and achieves a surprising intimacy of feeling.This painting is enigmatic in both composition and subject-matter. It strikes an uneasy note because of its stark simplicity, which has usually been interpreted as a genre scene of low life - a woman crushing a flea between her fingernails - but no authentic La Tour depicts such an obviously banal theme without a deeper meaning. The only symbol in the picture is the solitary candle burning on the chair, and it is surely not too speculative to suggest that the picture might reprsent the pregnant Virgin, isolated by Joseph when he discovers that she is with child, the candle thus symbolizing the forthcoming Christ as the Light of the World.

17509-18virgin.jpg	This small painting is unique in Gossart's oeuvre for its portrayal of the Virgin and Child in a palace interior. it is accepted as the original of a composition that exists in at least three other versions.The painter featured his favourite pigment, ultramarine, in an exaggerated, complex system of folds for the Virgin's drapery, which extends over nearly a third of the composition.
