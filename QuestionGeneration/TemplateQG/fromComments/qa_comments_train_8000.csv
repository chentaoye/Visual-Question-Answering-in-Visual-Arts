18128-assumpti.jpg	This altarpiece was made for a Medici Chapel in S. Pier Maggiore in Florence. It can be seen that Granacci's style is close to Michelangelo's panel-painting style. The predilection for an unfussy drapery style and designs of powerful three-dimensionality featuring monumental, sculptural figures are shared by both painters. The represented saints are Thomas, John the Baptist, James, Lawrence and Bartholomew. Vasari claimed that St Thomas was so vigorous that it might be taken for one by Michelangelo

13661-assumpti.jpg	This painting is a pivotal work in evaluating how the artist interpreted his decisive Flemish influences: the abundant and angular folds of the robes, the way he depicts the ringleted hair of the angels who minister to the Blessed Virgin or the manner in which he painstakingly paints with precise realism and poetic sentiment, the details and miniature forms of the upper background			
36959-ychahut1.jpg	In 1887-90 Seurat was working on the Circus Parade, Le Chahut and the not quite finished Circus. It was a Degas world. The effects of stage lighting, overlapping and cropped foreground figures, and a certain malice in the grotesque way types of people or posture are presented, are related to Degas. However, the differences are greater: a sense of ceremony accompanied by distortions and grimaces, motion arrested in mechanical parallel attitudes, a strict patterning of spaces, and an emphatically enigmatic flavour despite the seemingly straightforward attention-getting

42612-25artpa.jpg	Signature: Signed on map, to the right of the girl.Provenance: Mentioned in 1676 in an act signed by Vermeer's widow, conveying the painting to her mother. Acceptance by the mother in 1677. This is certainly not no: 3 in the sale of 1696 in Amsterdam. The description does not agree. Purchased by Johann Rudolf Count Czernin in 1813 from the estate of Gottfried van Swieten, via a saddlemaker. Count Czernin paid 50 Austrian guilders for it. The painting was then attributed to Pieter de Hooch. In 1860, the painting was recognized as a Vermeer by Waagen. In the possession of Adolf Hitler after 1938, and hung at his residence in Berchtesgaden. Acquired by the museum in 1946.This painting was long called The Artist in His Studio, and we may in effect presume that the artist seen from behind was himself. However, the intention of representing an allegory is stronger here than in all other Vermeer's works. The heavy curtain on the left, which lets the viewer partake of the scene, has decidedly theatrical connotations. So does the young girl whom the artist portrays, and whose crown of laurel easily identifies her as Fame. A connection with Clio, the muse of history, also exists. She holds a trumpet and a book of Thucydides.The whole composition is a panegyric to the art of painting. Set in an elegant room, with a chandelier, chairs, the lush curtain, and a large map on the back wall, which shows the northern and southern Netherlands and indicates the area over which the reputation of the artist could spread, its overall meaning emphasizes the attainment of fame to the benefit of the man in the pursuit of his artistic endeavours as well as 'qua' citizen of his hometown.The uncommonly large painting, considered from the pictorial viewpoint only, is rather decorative but lacks depth. Only its meaning makes it of particular interest. Repeated restorations may have contributed to the narrative rather than painterly excellence of the work. Such as it presents itself now, one cannot be astonished that it was formerly attributed to Pieter de Hooch

23377-01antoni.jpg	The scarlet curtain is drawn aside to reveal a sacred scene with a social and historical content. The confusion of indiscriminate need meets the discriminating order of assistance.

Jupiter's mother fled to Crete where she gave birth to him in a cave. She gave Saturn a large stone wrapped in swaddling clothes which he unsuspectingly swallowed instead.

17981-05scene.jpg	"The sequence of pictures continues on the left north wall in the second row, meaning that the next picture is above the Birth of St Francis. It depicts the Dream of Innocent III and the Confirmation of the Rule by Pope Honorius III, the successor of Innocent III. The depiction of chronologically separate events and two popes in one picture is designed to do justice to the actual historical facts, which were frequently confused by painters who depicted the oral confirmation of the rule by Innocent III as having been a written approval.A fluted pillar in the centre of the picture divides it into two halves. This method of structuring the surface of the picture has already been seen in the first fresco. The pope's vision shows a monk hurrying up on the left in order to support the Lateran basilica that is about to collapse. In front of the church a lavish meadow covered with numerous flowers and grasses is spread out. In the fine arts, the legends of St Dominic and St Francis were from time to time confused. Sometimes it is Dominic who has the crucial role of supporting the collapsing Lateran basilica. This depiction appears, for example, in two predella panels by Fra Angelico: in the altar showing the Sacra Conversazione, 1435/36, now in the Museo Diocesano in Cortona, and in the Coronation of Mary, now in the Louvre in Paris.In addition, Benozzo's method of depiction here gives us an insight into the modernity of his visual language. When compared to the fresco by Giotto at Assisi, it is noticeable that the latter chose a stronger angle of inclination to express the gap between dream and reality. Benozzo made use of a different solution. He placed the dreaming pope in the rear and St Francis in the front picture plane, and in so doing was making use of a compositional principle that was popular during the Renaissance. The right half of the picture shows the confirmation of the rule taking place inside a palace. The pope has raised his right hand in blessing and in his left is holding an open scroll of parchment which St Francis has grasped at the lower edge. On the scroll the following words can be read: REGULA ET VITA MINORUM FRATRUM H(A)EC E(ST): D(OMI)NI NOSTRI IHESU XRI SANCTUM EVA(N)G(E)L(IUM) (OBSERVARE) - ""It is the rule and the life of the Minorites to observe the Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord."

Cleopatra's exposed d�collet� is meant as a reference to the by now advanced stage of her relationship with Antony. In contrast to Tiepolo's Melbourne picture of the same subject, the erotic and witty interpretation of historical events is given prominence over the festive setting itself.

22573-5vault.jpg	The vaulting in the Strozzi Chapel contains depictions of Adam and the patriarchs Abraham, Jacob, and Noah. In the lunettes below are the depictions of the martyrdoms of St John (above) and St Philip (below).The patriarchs do not appear in their chronological, biblical sequence. Instead they have been placed so as to relate to the subject matter of the wall paintings below. Abraham and his sacrificial altar appear above the scene in which Philip refuses to make a pagan sacrifice. Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac also prefigures Christ's death on the cross, owing to which Philip himself was crucified. Noah, the earliest of the patriarchs, appears above the left wall. In general, he symbolizes salvation from death, and this is important in both of the scenes from the legend of John the Evangelist. Adam, who is normally not included in cycles of patriarchs, also has a direct connection to the subject matter of the window wall directly beneath him. His is the most prominent position, as he is visible even from outside the chapel and appears directly above the altar and the donor's tomb. He is clothed in the skin of a cow and holds a staff - both allusions to his life of struggle and toil after his banishment from paradise. Although it is he who first introduced Original Sin to the world, he was the first man whom the resurrected Christ chose to save as he passed through purgatory

41948-rockylan.jpg	This painting depicts a rocky landscape with travellers on a path, with a view of a town, believed to be Huy, in the valley beyond.It is the first mountain landscape in Lucas van Valckenborch's  oeuvre, and the steep cliffs which dominate the left-hand side of this composition would become a recurring motif in his paintings.Valckenborch, along with contemporaries such as Gillis Mostaert and Gillis van Coninxloo, was working in the tradition of the so-called 'world landscapes' - the term used to describe the panoramic vistas taken from a bird's-eye viewpoint, largely painted in Antwerp in the 16th century.

07543-35emmau.jpg	"The gospel according to St Luke (24:13-32) tells of the meeting of two disciples with the resurrected Christ. It is only during the meal that his companions recognize him in the way he blesses and breaks the bread. But with that, the vision of Christ vanishes. In the gospel according to St Mark (16:12) he is said to have appeared to them ""in an other form"" which is why Caravaggio did not paint him with a beard at the age of his crucifixion, but as a youth.The host seems interested but somewhat confused at the surprise and emotion shown by the disciples. The light falling sharply from the top left to illuminate the scene has all the suddenness of the moment of recognition. It captures the climax of the story, the moment at which seeing becomes recognizing. In other words, the lighting in the painting is not merely illumination, but also an allegory. It models the objects, makes them visible to the eye and is at the same time a spiritual portrayal of the revelation, the vision, that will be gone in an instant.Caravaggio has offset the transience of this fleeting moment in the tranquillity of his still life on the table. On the surfaces of the glasses, crockery, bread and fruit, poultry and vine leaves, he unfurls all the sensual magic of textural portrayal in a manner hitherto unprecedented in Italian painting.The realism with which Caravaggio treated even religious subjects - apostles who look like labourers, the plump and slightly feminine figure of Christ - met with the vehement disapproval of the clergy"

06373-07census.jpg	Seen from above, the snow-covered village stretches on the one side to a ruined castle and on the other, beyond the pond, as far as the church. People are going about their daily tasks: sweeping the snow, building a cabin, crossing the pond on foot next to a ferry-boat caught in the ice, gathering around a fire. The children are playing, throwing snowballs, skating, spinning  their tops, sledging. In the right hand foreground, a man with a large carpenter's saw is leading an ox and an ass, the latter bearing a women wrapped tightly in an ample blue mantle. Without attracting attention, they pick their way between the carts of beer barrels and bales. These are Joseph and Mary, who have come to Bethlehem to be enrolled in the universal census ordered by Emperor Augustus. The Gospel episode is associated with the payment of tax. And indeed to the left, the crowd is pressing in front of the tax-gatherer's office, installed at the window of the inn, whilst in front of the door, a pig is being killed.The picture suggests a muffled atmosphere, made more limpid by the reddening disk of the setting sun. With tiny highlights and reworkings and subtle nuances of colour, Bruegel works on the whites to evoke the snow in all its diversity: powdery and virgin, footprinted, grey and frozen from where the children have been sliding on it, slushy where trampled. The scene is punctuated with thin trees whose empty branches stand out like signposts against a clear sky, thinly painted to allow the background layer to show through.In a masterful synthesis of religious painting, genre scene and landscape, Bruegel recomposes everyday life, revisiting the biblical story to create a picture of a rarely equalled richness, which can be read in several ways. With a few deft brushstrokes he brilliantly captures human silhouettes in the full spontaneity of their activities. Drawing his inspiration probably from the snow-covered landscapes found in Books of Hours, Bruegel is one of the first artists to paint snow scenes, a theme he returned to another four times. In his wake, the subject proved an immense success, with winter landscapes becoming a genre of their own. 14 copies of this panel are known, one of which, from the hand of Brueghel the Younger, is also in the Brussels museum

02919-storm.jpg	While Dutch primacy in merchant shipping offered high rewards, its risks were equally significant. On their long journeys to the Mediterranean, the New World, Africa, and the East, merchant vessels were perennially endangered by warfare, piracy, treacherous shores, and storms. Several painters, most dramatically Ludolf Backhuysen, specialized in ships adrift in tempests.Backhuysen executed this painting (his largest surviving one) as if he were observing the disaster in the midst of the roiling seas, thus engaging beholders in the unfolding tragedy, encouraging them to empathize with the ships and their crews and to contemplate the powers of God, beyond full comprehension.But even as such paintings acknowledge the fragility of Dutch seaborne success, their distant shafts of sunlight usually hold out hope for reversals of misfortune. A brighter future may still save Backhuysen's ship at left, its Dutch flag unfurled against lightening skies. Collectors occasionally hung a tempest painting opposite a sunny shipping scene, implying that the power of God and nature, whether terrifying or benevolent, is always magnificent.

12484-10seven1.jpg	This panel is a monumental picture depicting Mary as the Mother of Sorrows. It was severely damaged in an attack when acid was thrown at it in 1988, and ten years have been spent restoring it. It is the central picture of the seven scenes from the Passion which are in the Gem&#228;ldegalerie in Dresden. The work was presumably ordered by Elector Frederick the Wise for the Wittenberg university chapel. Mary's arms are crossed and she is looking up in suffering, while a sword that is threateningly close to her heart is approaching, a symbol of her agonizing pain caused by the sufferings of Christ, narrated on either side in the scenes from the Passion. As a sign of her virginity, Mary is wearing a white cloth and a heavy blue garment, the colour which refers to her status as the Queen of Heaven

14452-215fried.jpg	Having barely changed at all right into the 1820s, Friedrich's style now began to show signs of a subtle evolution. His formerly somewhat reserved, dry, often monochrome use of colour now began to give way to a more differentiated palette. Passages of glaze are complemented by areas of impasto; the colour range is frequently enhanced with very light values, and Friedrich's handling of paint becomes looser and somewhat more spontaneous. English influences, from Constable or others working in a similar vein, may account for Friedrich's interest in cloud studies. Drifting Clouds is an example of these studies.This small composition is probably identical to a work recorded in Dresden in 1859 and described as portraying a Riesengebirge landscape with the source of the Elbe

41365-11sancta.jpg	Like in the scenes of the martyrdom of St Peter and St Paul, the interiors in the frescoes of St Lawrence and St Nicholas do not develop into real depictions of space. The extremely foreshortened buildings suggest the location only in a very rudimentary way, even if they are provided with a number of decorative details. The convoluted architectural prospect in the painting of Nicholas providing the dowry is typical in this respect. It includes both an exterior view of the house and a view into its interior, showing the bedchamber where the father, visibly worried, and his three peacefully slumbering daughters lie in their beds, and where the saint appears in a window higher up and throws down a bag containing the gold coins intended as a dowry for the girls

10520-saints.jpg	Carlo Crivelli was one of the young artists involved in the new developments taking place in Padua around the middle of the 15th century. But in his version of Renaissance naturalism, even more so than in that of Cosm� Tura, we can still see the influence of the Medieval traditions. Forced to leave Venice soon after 1467, Crivelli carried on his solitary activity in the Marches, developing an art rich in figurative detail and luminous in the clarity of form and colour. He was influenced by the wealth of culture which flourished at the court of Ferrara with the presence there of Piero della Francesca and Rogier van der Weyden.In his later works his sensitive approach to the intellectual search for technical perfection achieved, by means of a purity of line and colour, a refined and moving elegance. Evidence of this can be seen in the work St Jerome and St Augustine. The intensity with which the two saints are portrayed against the gold ground, the linear vitality and the vibrant use of colour are impressive, as is the portrait of the lion with its metallic mane, its head raised in a roar, its claws gripping the marble.This panel together with another representing St Peter and St Paul belonged to an altarpiece in the cathedral of Camerino, flanking a central Virgin and Child Enthroned (now in the Brera, Milan). The cathedral was destroyed in an earthquake in 1799

He executed approximately one hundred views of the city, of which thirty-three were paintings and the remainder watercolours and engravings.Between 1783-89 Catherine II had one of the great monuments of Neoclassicism built for her favourite, Gregory Potemkin. After his success in annexing Crimea (Tauride), this Field Marshall was rewarded with the honorary title of Prince of Tauride and given a palace.

44402-air_pump.jpg	Most of Joseph Wright's paintings explore the effects of light and illumination. He counted amongst his close friends a number of factory owners and scientists, the very people who were the driving force behind the changes that came with the dawn of the industrial age, which was to bring so much profit and wreak such disaster. He was fascinated by mankind's encounter with technology innovation and invention, and with the myth of a new era which he monumentalised in his paintings. The light that Caravaggio used to project his revelations and celestial visions seems to have fascinated Wright as well. But the spectator soon realizes that any similarity is misleading. In the work of Caravaggio, the source of light remains unknown so that it seems almost supernatural. Wright, on the other hand, uses light for dramatic effect. The experiment carried out by the elderly, long-haired scholar thus becomes an exciting theatrical scene.The scientist is demonstrating the principle of the vacuum, Using a pump, he has emptied the glass sphere of air, creating a vacuum in which a bird seems to be struggling to gasp its last breath. Pained, the little girl turns her face away as though witnessing the martyrdom of a saint. Here, we find religious iconography being used to portray a worldly situation, elevating the scientific experiment to a para-religious event

19162-46bnopor.jpg	"This painting of an unidentified 26-yer-old man was cut down at all sides.

37960-serenade.jpg	During the 1670s, when Steen returned to Leiden and was apparently active as an innkeeper, he continued to be prolific. Large subject pictures and genre scenes, as well as tiny, carefully finished paintings, were made during his last years. There is an increasing elegance and an occasional use of glossy paint during this phase, but his sharp wit and good humour are not affected at all. In some of these late works there is already a premonition of Watteau's elegant idylls. The Nocturnal Serenade shows a whole group dressed and masked as Italian comedians; the theme is one Rococo painters were to use frequently. The slightly elongated proportions of Steen's masquers are already closer  to those used by eighteenth-century artists than to the ones employed by his own contemporaries.

04807-cremona5.jpg	The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht D�rer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy D�rer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.In the scenes of the Birth of Mary and Betrothal of Mary, festive colour dominates both the interior and the temple square, while in the background the dark openings of the fireplace and the gate correspond

09884-courb222.jpg	Courbet's commitment to politics led to a period of imprisonment. He immortalized this part of his life in Self-Portrait at Sainte-P�lagie. Immediately after his arrest in June 1871, he was accused of having taken part in the Paris Commune, the last of the nineteenth-century revolutions in France. During his trial, Courbet was accused of having taken part in the destruction of the colonne Vend�me, which had been erected by Napoleon I to commemorate the victories of the Grande Arm�e. Found guilty in 1871, Courbet found himself worse off again after his appeal in 1874.In Self-Portrait at Sainte-P�lagie, Courbet presents himself in the cell of his Paris prison, seated on a table, near a half-open window somewhat obstructed by the solid prison bars. He is simply dressed, wearing a chestnut suit and a beret, his red neck-scarf the only note of colour in this dark-toned painting. His pipe is, as always, in his mouth and his mainly impassive stare is directed, with perhaps a touch of nostalgia, toward the prison yard

17126-arles48.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 482, JH 1608.In August and September 1888, van Gogh executed four paintings depicting sunflowers in a vase. He intended to decorate a room in the house, the so-called Yellow House, that he rent in Arles. He also painted a portrait of his bedroom in the Yellow House as part of the projected decoration of the house with works which would show Gauguin what he had been doing.Powerful effects of immediacy and invitation were achieved in the painting by the deviation from rigorous geometric perspective. The spatial effect of the relationship between the objects in the painting and the position in which we as spectators are placed has been perceptively described as 'phenomenological space', that is, spatial relations as we experience and remember them rather than as they are conventionally represented in paintings made according to the geometric perspective systems used by artists since the Renaissance. Thus, in addition to exploiting the expressive possibilities of colour, van Gogh was investigating the expressive possibilities of new representations of space

15868-psyche1.jpg	The four paintings in the Royal Collection (Psyche Honoured by the People, Psyche's Parents Offering Sacrifice to Apollo, Psyche Served by Invisible Spirits, and Venus Punishing Psyche with a Task) form part of a series of twelve, illustrating incidents from the story of Cupid and Psyche as recounted at considerable length by Apuleius in The Golden Ass (Books 4-6).In general terms Apuleius tells how Venus sought to punish the young Psyche, whose beauty challenged even that of the goddess of love. Accordingly, Venus instructs Cupid to arrange for an unsuitable match for Psyche, but instead Cupid himself falls in love with her. He installs Psyche in his palace, but chooses to visit her only at night. Psyche's sisters, however, overcome by jealousy, maintain that her lover is in reality a monster. Her curiosity aroused, Psyche, although strictly forbidden to look at him, observes Cupid by the light of a lamp, but taken by surprise she allows oil from the lamp to fall on Cupid and so wakens him. To punish Psyche for her disobedience Cupid disappears. He is sought far and wide by Psyche, but in vain. Both Cupid and Psyche thus incur the wrath of Venus. Psyche then tries to win back Cupid's favour by performing numerous well-nigh impossible tasks set for her by Venus. These she undertakes successfully except for the last which involves the recovery of Persephone's casket from Hades.Although expressly told not to open it, Psyche is again overcome by curiosity and opens the casket only to find that it does not contain beauty, but a deadly sleep that overwhelms her. At this point Jupiter, encouraged by Cupid, takes pity on Psyche and consents to their marriage in heaven.Even though the series by Giordano amounts to twelve scenes, the Neapolitan artist by no means depicts the narrative in full, and in this respect the series appears to have been left incomplete. The four scenes chosen here illustrate different parts of the story.Psyche honoured by the People and Psyche's Parents offering Sacrifice to Apollo are consecutive incidents from the beginning of the sequence. They refer respectively to the open acknowledgement of Psyche's beauty that provokes the initial jealousy of Venus, and the anxiety felt by Psyche's parents on suspecting that the goddess has been angered.The story of Cupid and Psyche was open to several interpretations, some of which during the Renaissance were of a philosophical disposition, but it would appear that Giordano has concentrated more on the narrative elements. The first composition (Psyche honoured by the People) is possibly derived from the sixteenth-century engraving of the subject by the Master of the Die, which forms part of an extensive and influential series of prints designed by Michael Coxie and illustrating Apuleius's text with a certain degree of literalness. Several of the subjects treated by the Master of the Die were not included by Giordano. An essential difference is that Giordano depicts Cupid as a youth rather than as a child.The paintings are late works by the artist dating from 1692-1702, the years when he was in Spain at the court of Charles II. The fluidity of the brushwork, the sheer liquidity of the paint, the spirited inventiveness of the compositions, together with the delicate, refined colours are highly characteristic of Giordano at the height of his powers. The charm of the paintings is enhanced by the reduced scale which Giordano so often eschewed in favour of large decorative schemes. Essentially, the story of Cupid and Psyche was a suitable subject for a court artist. The series may indeed have been painted for Queen Maria Ana, the wife of Charles II of Spain, since they were apparently given by the queen to the Duc de Grammont after the death of the king in 1700

12525-01veneti.jpg	The portrait is one of the first works of the artist during his second sojourn in Venice. It was painted in the autumn or in the winter of 1505. From the portraits, an extraordinary charm emanates, which cannot be merely attributable to the shades of brown and gold of the hairdo and clothing, which are set apart from the uniform black background. It is really the beauty of the portrait that fascinates in its entirety and in its variety of details. It is the slight wave of the hair on the clear, high forehead that imperceivably becomes curls caressing the girl's cheeks. It is the dreamy gaze that shows, under the slightly lowered eyelids, the radiant, black eyes. It highlights the play of light on the forehead and on the cheeks. It is the candour of this face, of the neck and chest, emphasized by a neckline of a contrasting colour, that evoke the image of the ideal purity of a girl. With great ability, the artist includes in this image a long and pronounced nose and large, sensual lips, immersing the whole figure in a light that reveals the important influence of the Venetian school, and, in particular, that of Giovanni Bellini.With reference to some of the details, it has been repeatedly made known that the portrait is unfinished. It is probable that D�rer deliberately did not give the same intensity to the left ribbon as to the right: on the one hand, so as to not overwhelm the charm of the dark eyes; on the other, so as to support the subtle chromatic effect of the bodice that, from the design of the gold ribbons, contributes to the overall charm of the painting.This charm is also shown in the movement in the double rows of pearls, interrupted by the darker shapes of doubled cones, making the pendant curve slightly from the neck.Among D�rer's works, there is not a more beautiful portrait of a woman. Indeed, it has led one to think that there was a rather intimate relationship between the artist and the model. Some see the woman as a courtesan, others define her as an instinctive, languorous, and melting beauty

08658-08h_card.jpg	At a time when large-scale heroic narrative painting was thought to be the most meritorious, Chardin, thwarted by his lack of academic training in drawing, became one of the greatest practitioners of the 'lowly' art of still life. Born in Paris, where he spent most of his life, he first trained at the guild school of Saint-Luc, before gaining admittance to the French Royal Academy in the category of a still-life and animal painter. By the end of his life his works were to be found in most of the great private collections of the time. Although totally dependent on observation and on working closely from nature, Chardin evolved methods of painting at a distance from the model, so that he was able to reconcile particular detail with a more generalised effect. While some critics deplored his inability to paint more 'elevated' subjects others, like the influential philosopher Diderot, praised the 'magic' of his brush: 'This magic defies understanding...it is a vapour that has been breathed onto the canvas...Approach the painting, and everything comes together in a jumble, flattens out, and vanishes; move away, and everything creates itself and reappears.'In the early 1730s, perhaps in response to the amicable taunt of Joseph Aved, a portrait-painter friend, Chardin also turned to small-scale figure painting, influenced by the Dutch and Flemish seventeenth-century masters of everyday scenes. Encouraged by the success of these homespun compositions of kitchen maids and serving men at work, he moved from the sculleries of the bourgeoisie to their living quarters. By narrowing the focus to the half-length figure, he was also able to enlarge it in scale, as he does here. In this wonderfully intimate and contemplative picture, he portrays the son of his friend Monsieur Lenoir, a furniture-dealer and cabinet-maker.The House of Cards owes its subject to the moralising vanitas paintings of the seventeenth century. The verses under the engraving of the picture, published in 1743, stress the insubstantiality of human endeavours, as frail as a house of cards. But the painting tends to undermine the moral. Its rigorously geometric and stable composition gives an air of permanence which contradicts the fugitive nature of the boy's pastime, and of childhood itself. Chardin's 'magic accord' of tones envelops the scene securely in its warm and subtle light, at once direct and diffused. His technique remained secret, although it was suspected that he used his thumb as much as his brush. We can well believe, however, his response to the enquiry of a mediocre painter, 'We use colours, but we paint with feeling.

19903-02henry8.jpg	The top job of Holbein, the court painter, was quite certainly to paint the king's portrait. In the 1530s, Henry VIII had enlarged his London residence Whitehall Palace, and needed a grand picture for it. It was to feature not only him and his wife Jane Seymour, but also his parents, the first Tudor monarchs, and was also intended to proclaim the fame of the ruling house in word and image. Since the composition probably adorned one wall of the Privy Chamber, a private chamber accessible only to more intimate members of court, the picture was not aimed at a broad public but a select group at court.No contract for the mural survives, but Henry VIII must have commissioned it in the short time during which he was married to Jane Seymour, in other words between May 30, 1536, and October 12, 1537. Both Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn were already dead; in showing Jane together with Elizabeth of York and the Tudor monarchs in the picture, Henry's new connection was presented as the only legitimate one and the children of the marriage as the only rightful heirs. Possibly the picture was commissioned shortly after the wedding: in the surviving section of the cartoon a cartouche is included in the frieze, displaying the initials of Henry and Jane linked in a love knot. According to the copy by the painter Remigius van Leemput (1607-1675) in 1667, the cartouche on the mural as painted bore the date 1537.The picture shows a copy of the figure of Henry VIII from the left side of the mural which was destroyed in the Whitehall fire in 1698. Henry VIII stands in the foreground like a colossus with legs apart and knees straight. His broad shoulders, emphasized by his heavy clothing, exaggerate the already unusual physical presence of this large man, whose sex is additionally stressed by a prominent girdle and codpiece. The king thus appears as the epitome of vigour and potency. This stance, with legs apart and knees locked straight, is very uncommon for the portrait of a king. The reason may be that at the time spread legs were considered improper, as the Frankfurt scholar Jodocus Willich ( 1501-15 52) explains in a treatise on gestures first published in Basel in 1540. However, in visual art the stance was also associated with triumphant heroes; St. George, for example, can stand in a comparable pose after overcoming the dragon.

40791-epitaph.jpg	The work is a fragment of the epitaph of Jan of Jeren, canon of Prague, who died in 1395 and was buried in Prague Cathedral. The inscribed panel must have been set on his tomb a short time afterwards.The Madonna and Child may have been in the centre of the surviving right-hand part, while on the left further saints and the praying figure of the donor may have completed the composition. The Apostles Bartholomew and Thomas are standing on a narrow strip of ground in front of a shining golden background. Their figures are surrounded by abundant intricate draperies, whose edges of soft lines, corners and folds which tumble down like waterfalls seem to live a separate life independent of the bodies. The bright colours of the two saints' cloaks complement one another-as do the hues of the linings. The pink lining of the green cloak and the blue lining of the red one serve a purely decorative function.The artist composed the two figures so as to create harmonious forms. The right-hand edge of St Bartholomew's draperies, forming a gently wavy line and the straight left-hand contour of St Thomas's mantle, which appears to continue the line of the spear, run very near each other. This narrow stripe turns the two figures into a form springing from the same basis and bending in two opposite directions. At the bottom the formation is completed by the green cloak flowing into the red one, while at the top it is enclosed by the tips of the flaying knife and of the spear which touch each other

42624-28astro.jpg	Signature: Signed and dated 668 on the cupboard (spurious, later additions).Provenance: This painting and the Geographer (St&#228;delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt) are probably companion pieces, in spite of the fact that the sitter is looking to the left in both of them. They share the same provenance until 1778. Thus: sale Rotterdam, 1713; sale Amsterdam, 1720; sale Amsterdam, 1729; sale Amsterdam, 1778. Collection Jean-Etienne Fiseau; art dealer Lebrun, Paris; brought to Paris in 1785; sale Amsterdam, 1797; sale Amsterdam, 1800; sale Paris, 1881; collection Alphonse de Rothschild, Paris, 1888; collection Edouard de Rothschild. Abducted by Hitler during World War II. Restored to owner in 1945. Acquired by Mus�e du Louvre, Paris, 1983.In view of the fact that the Astronomer and the Geographer are probably pendants, and are the only works in Vermeer's oeuvre that represent male figures involved in scholarly pursuits, we are treating them conjointly.Until 1778, they remained together. The signatures and dates on both paintings are questionable, but they must have been executed toward the end of the 1660s.None of these paintings appears in the sale of 1696, and were therefore commissioned by a patron who was especially interested in astronomy or the celestial sciences. In both paintings, the references to books, scientific instruments, and, in the portrait of the Astronomer, the celestial globe by Jodocus Hondius, are accurately depicted.The latter painting features on the rear wall a picture representing the scene of the finding of Moses, which has been interpreted as being associated with the advice of divine providence in reaching, in the case of the astronomer, for spiritual guidance.Although farfetched, it is likely that the content of the painting is associated in some way with the meaning of the work. The sea chart on the wall of the Geographer does not have any religious association. It must be remembered that the rise of interest in scientific research at the time, fostered by the newly established University of Leyden, and philosophers like Descartes, did not have any specific religious associations. Quite to the contrary, the aim was to explore the universe, and simultaneously to further Dutch navigation in its conquest of faraway lands.Both paintings, with their interiors of scholarly studios and scientific paraphernalia, award Vermeer the opportunity for lightening effects that envelop the scientists in the mystery of an atmosphere that lifts their occupations into the realm of spirituality

30574-oharbour.jpg	In a cove overlooking a turbulent sea and under fast-moving clouds, a fortified harbour stretches out on a hill in the right foreground. Crowned by a central building with a western-style entrance, this is nonetheless a Turkish area, as can be seen from the crescent moon on the flag above the fortress and the turbans of the harbour dwellers. Outside the port western ships lie at anchor, one of them flying the English St George's cross from its mizzen mast. The most striking vessel, in the left foreground, a heavily-armed three-master with the Dutch tricolour in front and the arms of Amsterdam on the escutcheon, is still under sail and approaching the harbour. A sloop has been set out from this vessel. In the right foreground a heavy trunk is being heaved ashore with considerable difficulty from a moored sloop carrying two distinguished men, one wearing a turban, another a fur hat.The painting is signed with monogram and dated in the centre right. However, the two final figures of the date are difficult to read. Reading the third number as a 5, which is the most probable solution, this situates the composition in the painter's later career, when he concentrated on harbour views having a reference to the Levant, or eastern Mediterranean, which the Venetians first reinforced with trading posts until these were later conquered by the Turks.The introduction of an exotic touch in Peeters' oeuvre is contemporaneous with a growing international demand for Italianising landscapes. Bonaventura Peeters the Elder, who became a free master of Antwerp in 1634, originally painted shipwrecks and rough seas, along with calmer Scheldt and coastal views and a subtly gradated palette. During the 17th century he was the leading marine painter in the Spanish Netherlands. His artistic importance can be cause for surprise because sea paintings are generally associated with the Dutch art of the Golden Age. However, like so many other genres, marine painting also originated in the Spanish Netherlands. With the migration of innovative artists like Adam Willaerts and Jan Porcellis from and to the United Provinces, the genre developed more or less in parallel in the North and the South. In terms of their quality and the finesse of their painting, the South Netherlandish seascapes deserve more attention and more detailed study than they have received until now.

07808-1vision.jpg	"Episode No. 1 of the series of seven paintings ""Episodes from the Life of Sts Jerome, George and Triphun"".The masterpiece in the series is certainly the Vision of St Augustine. The Saint is caught in the instant in which the voice of St Jerome distracts his attention from a letter he was writing to him, to advise him of his imminent death and ascent to heaven. The setting of this miraculous announcement is an idealistic version of the study of a Humanist of the period, a cultured man of letters well-versed also in astronomy, sculpture and music. This is clear from the rational organization of the space, the sophisticated furnishings and the variety of the numerous objects displayed on the desk, the bench, the wide platforms below, the shelves along the walls, the ledge and the cupboard behind the altar in the niche in the room to the left.Bathed in the strong light that streams in from the windows, every single detail acquires shapes and forms of unparalleled purity: the bindings of the books, the miniatures on the prayerbooks and the pages of the musical text; the shining gilt studs that hold down the green fabric on the desktop and the red upholstery on the elegant chair; the little Renaissance sculptures and the gilt bronze statue of the Saviour on the altar; the astrolabs and the large armillary sphere; the little Maltese dog listening to the mysterious voice, intercepting the bright ray of light and projecting a perfectly sharp and clear shadow"

17536-3hermaph.jpg	The subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses (4:285-388). A Hellenistic myth of oriental origin tells of a being who was half male, half female, the offspring of Hermes and Aphrodite (Mercury and Venus), hence his name. As a young man - he began life as a male - he once bathed in a lake, where Salmacis, one of Diana's nymphs, dwelt. She fell in love with him at first sight and clung to him with such passion that their two bodies became united in one.In Gossart's painting the two figures stand in the water, Hermaphroditus trying to resist her embrace, while in the left background, the uniting couple is depicted. Throughout the 1510s and 1520s, Gossart continued to search for successful solutions to depict interlocking figures - whether in confrontation as here, or in amorous embrace, as in his drawings of Adam and Eve. The present painting shows Gossart's early attempts in this regard

20377-16ingres.jpg	It is often said that while Delacroix was the great proponent of French Romanticism, his older contemporary Ingres was the champion of the classical tradition: obsessed with Raphael and antiquity, upholder of 'drawing' versus 'colour'. Real life being less tidy, however, we find that Delacroix was a more calculating artist than the hyper-emotional Ingres, who did not hesitate to break academic rules for expressive ends. Both painted subjects from literature and history, and his response to the female nude is as charged with erotic longing and scarcely sublimated violence as Delacroix's. Nor did Ingres invariably emulate Raphael and Poussin. Throughout his long career he tried to match style to subject, looking in turn to Greek vase painting, to the Early Renaissance, even to the Dutch seventeenth-century painters of everyday life.It is, however, true that drawing was of primary importance to him. Forced to support himself and his wife in Rome in 1814 by drawing the English tourists who flocked back to the city liberated from French rule, he developed a wonderfully spare, yet lively and descriptive line. Although he despised portraiture as a lower form of art, like his teacher David Ingres came to excel in it. Few of his painted portraits are more sumptuous than Madame Moitessier, begun in 1847 but completed only in 1856 when the artist, as he tells us in his signature, was 76.He had originally refused to paint this wealthy banker's wife, but when he met her he was so captivated by her beauty that he agreed, asking her to bring her small daughter, 'la charmante Catherine', whose head is visible under her mother's arm in a preparatory drawing in the Ingres Museum in Montauban. The doubtless bored and wriggling child was soon banished as Ingres wrestled with the picture, requiring long hours of immobility from his model. The sitter's dress was changed more than once. Ingres is recorded as still working on the portrait in 1847. The death of his wife in 1849 left him in despair and unable to paint for many months. In 1851 he began sittings anew and completed a standing likeness of In�s Moitessier in black (now in Washington). He returned to the seated version in 1852.When he had finished four years later the sitter was 35. Ageless like a goddess with her Grecian profile impossibly reflected in a mirror parallel to the back of her head but dressed with Second Empire opulence in flowered chintz, Madame Moitessier exemplifies the ambiguities of Ingres's art. The firm contour of her shoulders, arms and face defines flesh perfectly rounded - though barely modelled - and as poreless, smooth and luminous as polished alabaster, yet paradoxically soft to the touch. In contrast to the resiliently buxom horsehair settee, it arouses fantasies and fears of bruising. The pose, with head resting against the right forefinger, derives from an ancient wall painting and signifies as Ingres must have known matronly modesty. But 'classicising' devices are offset by the minutely realistic transcription of the surfaces of fabrics, the fashionable parure of jewels, ormolu frames, Oriental porcelain. The mixture of the general with the particular, timeless grandeur with bourgeois ostentation, languor with pictorial rigour, is unique to Ingres and far from bloodlessly Neo-classical

Had he lived longer, he might have become the true challenger of his beloved master. temperamental as well as gifted, Drouais was far quicker to forge a style like a weapon, hard, spare and sharp. What Drouais could achieve is summed up in Marius at Minturnae, painted in Rome in 1786. The Acad�mie refused to accept this as Drouais' posthumous 'agr�gation' piece, ostensibly because it had been painted abroad - despite pleas by his fellow-students.

32319-17winter.jpg	The Seasons, the four canvasses of Poussin's late period now in the Louvre, are an even more extreme personal statement than the Landscape with Diana and Orion. All Poussin's severity and pessimism seem to have disappeared in these paintings, to be replaced by a fusion of all the poetical leanings in his nature. They are the supreme expression, not in this case of mind over eye, but of praise for the beauty and grandeur of nature, now ordered by man, and now defeating man. Spring is luxuriant, Summer a fecund harvest, Autumn the gathering of mellow grapes and Winter the terrible deluge in which all mankind is overwhelmed and destroyed.These pictures exist on a complex series of levels, and even the most unscholarly spectator must be aware that Poussin was trying to balance moods and ideas in a much more subtle and intricate way than usual. Firstly, the pictures are a sequence, and they are hung in this way in the Grande Galerie of the Louvre. Spring is cool in tone, Summer and Autumn are warm, and Winter is cold. Even this obvious modulation of tones has its own rhythm. In all but Winter man is seen in harmony with nature, especially in Spring, surely one of the most perfect evocations of Paradise since the subject was attempted by fifteenth-century Netherlandish painters.

00784-cortona1.jpg	This polyptych, as shown by the recent restoration work, emerges from the combination of three wood panels of which it is formed, put together with the upper part and the border below. Therefore the three works must have been painted at different times and for different reasons. On the top are represented the Annunciation and the Crucifixion. In the middle of the polyptych there is a Virgin and Child. On the left Sts John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, while on the right Sts Matthew and Mary Magdalen are represented. On the predella episodes from the life of St Dominic, and other images of saints and angels are represented.Art critics tend to date the older wood painting, the one with the Virgin, to 1434 and the complete work to 1437.The triptych was placed on a lateral altar in the church of St Dominic in Cortona. At the beginning of the Second World War it was immured in the belfry where the wood suffered much damage due to humidity and temperatures. It was necessary to detach the painted surface and transfer it to a new base. It has been restored after many succeeding interventions. Unfortunately, it has lost its original solidity and need continuous reexamination

05880-isle1.jpg	"The Island of the Dead is the Swiss artist Arnold B�cklin's most famous composition. Beginning in 1880, he painted five modified versions, four of which have survived (Basel, Kunstmuseum; New York, Metropolitan Museum; Berlin, Nationalgalerie; and Leipzig, Museum der bildenden K�nste).Each version of the painting shows a magically illuminated island rising from the sea against a gloomy night sky. Burial chambers have been carved into the rocky cliffs around the natural harbour, with dark cypresses rising above them. A boat with a coffin, a statuesque figure swathed in white like a mummy and gazing away from the viewer, and an oarsman glides slowly across the water towards the island. Although we can almost hear the soft splashing of the oars, this only heightens the incredible silence that pervades the scene - a ""visual silence"" underscored by the equilibrium of horizontals and verticals. The low-lying horizon creates an impression of endless depths. The sparingness of the composition is matched by the palette: reddish rocks reflecting the last evening sunlight, the eerie white of the figure in the boat, the deep blue and violet of water and sky (which in other versions is stormy), and the dark, nearly blackish green of the cypresses. Many attempts have been made to find the original model for this mysterious island: the cemetery island of St. Jurai south of Dubrovnik, Pontikonissi off Corfu, and one of the Ponza Islands in the Golf of Gaeta have been suggested. But an identical correspondence for B�cklin's fascinating view has been found nowhere in reality.Beyond its evocation of life's transience, the potential meanings of this major work of Symbolism have yet to be entirely decoded. Nor, apparently were they ever intended to be, because the lady who commissioned the painting, Marie Berna of Frankfurt am Main, had desired ""a picture to dream over,"" and B�cklin himself envisioned its effect as being ""so silent that you would get a fright when there was a knock on the door."" The meaning of the enigmatic image ultimately remains up to the viewer's imagination"

32965-05sibyl1.jpg	In 1514 Raphael executed another small but significant fresco cycle for Agostino Chigi. The frescoes represent the Prophets and Sibyls. They are located in the chapel at the left of the apse of the Church of Santa Maria della Pace in Rome. The Sibyls sit above the arch that leads to the second private chapel of the banker Chigi. The turning movements of the bodies are reminiscent of those of The Virtues in the Stanza della Segnatura, but the coloration suggests they were painted at a later date.The figures occupy a trabeated loggia, on two levels. The structure of the loggia reflects the architecture of the chapel: its arches coincide with those of the window and entrance. The Prophets (Habakkuk, Jonah, David and Daniel, according to the most widely accepted interpretation) are generally attributed to a collaborator (perhaps Timoteo Viti) who must have based them on an original drawing by Raphael, for they are highly coherent. The Sibyls (Cumaean, Persian, Phrygian and Tiburtine) are attributed to Raphael. Like the Virtues in the Stanza della Segnatura, each of the figures is accompanied by an angel who indicates the divine spirit present in their prophecies. Between the Sibyls at the top of the arch is a small angel holding a lighted torch, the symbol of prophecy, which enlightens the darkness of the future

24509-medal1.jpg	The two heads that have been discovered in the jambs of the original two-light window behind the altar are supposed to be the work of two artists: the Iefthand one (this picture) is by Masolino, the righthand one by Masaccio, for the former is painted with a clearly marked outline and the latter is modelled directly with the use of light. But there are many scholars who disagree and believe that both heads are by Masolino.And the foliage pattern decorations that cover the jambs also appear to be the work of two different artists: the floral ornamentations above the two heads and the motif that frames the scene at the top, just under the window sill, are to be attributed to Masolino, whereas the decorations below the two medallions are more probably the work of Masaccio. But there is one scene that everyone agrees is by Masaccio: there are only two small fragments left of it, above the altar, but it was originally the scene of the Crucifixion of Peter

18198-0204grec.jpg	Small portable altarpiece with hinged wings, painted on both sides, of a type similar in form to others produced in Crete in the sixteenth century, but with an Italian Renaissance frame. The subjects on the front, from left to right, are the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Allegory of a Christian Knight, and the Baptism; and on the back, the Annunciation, Mount Sinai, and Adam and Eve.The theme of Mount Sinai, on the back of the central panel, was of Cretan origin, and faithfully repeats a traditional Byzantine model. The picture shows pilgrims on the way to the Monastery, and the Mountain as the Road to Heaven. The reference to Saint Catherine in both the central panels has been suggested as a possible indication of the artist's connection' in Crete with the monastery of Saint Catherine, a dependency of that of Mount Sinai, and the most important school of painting in the island. The other compositions are similarly not original, but here the artist has used engravings after Italian (mainly Venetian) compositions as his models.

33427-70newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 598.Rembrandt's final word is given in his monumental painting of the Return of the Prodigal Son. Here he interprets the Christian idea of mercy with an extraordinary solemnity, as though this were his spiritual testament to the world. It goes beyond the works of all other Baroque artists in the evocation of religious mood and human sympathy. The aged artist's power of realism is not diminished, but increased by psychological insight and spiritual awareness. Expressive lighting and colouring and the magic suggestiveness of his technique, together with a selective simplicity of setting, help us to feel the full impact of the event.The main group of the father and the Prodigal Son stands out in light against an enormous dark surface. Particularly vivid are the ragged garment of the son, and the old man's sleeves, which are ochre tinged with golden olive; the ochre colour combined with an intense scarlet red in the father's cloak forms an unforgettable colouristic harmony. The observer is roused to a feeling of some extraordinary event. The son, ruined and repellent, with his bald head and the appearance of an outcast, returns to his father's house after long wanderings and many vicissitudes. He has wasted his heritage in foreign lands and has sunk to the condition of a swineherd. His old father, dressed in rich garments, as are the assistant figures, has hurried to meet him before the door and receives the long-lost son with the utmost fatherly love.The occurrence is devoid of any momentary violent emotion, but is raised to a solemn calm that lends to the figures some of the qualities of statues and gives the emotions of a lasting character, no longer subject to the changes of time. Unforgettable is the image of the repentant sinner leaning against his father's breast and the old father bending over his son. The father's features tell of a goodness sublime and august; so do his outstretched hands, not free from the stiffness of old age. The whole represents a symbol of all homecoming, of the darkness of human existence illuminated by tenderness, of weary and sinful mankind taking refuge in the shelter of God's mercy

29443-gonfalon.jpg	The most important brotherhood in Rome was that of the Gonfalone. It had its newly constructed oratory frescoed from 1568 to 1577, with many artists participating in the project. With the help of their cardinal protector, Alessandro Farnese, the members of the brotherhood were able to win over Jacopo Zanguidi, known as Il Bertoia, for the design of the decorative system. Painted Solomonic columns articulated a history cycle and supported an elaborate entablature, above which, in an upper zone of the wall, prophets and sibyls sit with scrolls, Old Testament kings, and virtues. The narratives of the paintings depict the Passion of Christ from the entry into Jerusalem to the Resurrection.

07525-27ceras.jpg	In 1600 Annibale Carracci and Caravaggio received a joint commission from Tiberio Cerasi to decorate his chapel in the Santa Maria del Popolo.

32891-1expuls.jpg	In the Stanza di Eliodoro Raphael enhances his compositions by breaking up the symmetry and the enclosed rhythm of the Stanza della Segnatura with more lively and colourful effects. These trends appear first in the Expulsion of Heliodorus.The focal point of the scene is no longer at the centre. Rather, it is shifted to the right. Here Heliodorus and his followers, profaning the Temple of Jerusalem, are driven out by an armed rider and by two running figures. In the depiction of the rider and the two hovering youths, Raphael follows the text from Maccabees in the Apocrypha exactly. The horse owes a debt to Leonardo's design for the Battle of Anghiari in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.In the centre, the expanse of the wide nave, illuminated by the reflections of light in the vault, is a more effective space-determining motif than the large patches of blue sky which appeared through the coffered ceiling in the School of Athens.At the extreme left, Pope Julius II dominates the bystanders, and he reappears in subsequent scenes as well.Raphael's new compositional formula, so unexpected after the extremely controlled compositions of the Stanza della Segnatura, is visible in all its dynamic evidence from this fresco onward

According to the reconstruction accepted by many scholars, the altarpiece consisted of a Virgin and Child in the centre (Brooklyn Museum, New York), St Augustin (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg) at the left, and probably St Nicholas (lost) at the right. The three predella panels are the Departure of St Augustin (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), the Entry of Christ to Jerusalem (Pinacoteca Stuard, Parma), and the Birth of St Nicholas (Kunstmuseum, Basel)

05827-2erasm.jpg	St Erasmus was the bishop of Formia, near Gaeta in Italy, during the 5th century. According to legend, he was put to death by the Arian Lombards and died in the most terrible agony. Bouts represents St Erasmus virtually naked and stretched out on a board, to which he is bound by his hands and feet. A hole has been cut in his belly and one end of his intestines tied to a winch. Two executioners are busy disembowelling him. One is old and bald, and works with his sleeves rolled up, winding the handle of the winch with great vigour. The other is young; he seems to be disturbed by what is happening, and goes about his task with less enthusiasm. Behind them is a bearded figure, wearing a rich coat of blue and gold brocade trimmed with fur. He surveys the torturers with an attitude that is both simple and dignified. From the way he leans on his stick, you might think he was overseeing some administrative formality. Of the three men with him, only one looks directly towards the scene, while the other two ignore it as if it were an event of no importance. Despite the horrific nature of the act, there is no sign of any blood anywhere. The wings of the triptych show, on the left, St Jerome resplendent in his cardinal's robes, with his emblematic lion at his feet, and on the right, St Bernard wearing a plain habit, and holding his abbot's crook in one hand.Behind the figures, a landscape extends across all three panels of the triptych. The green hills and the roads that run between them have been identified with the rolling countryside around Leuven. The brilliance of the light and colours in which nature is rendered here is so extraordinary that one feels this must be the result of the first-ever exercise in open-air painting. Bouts was a master of landscape art, as his contemporary Johannus Molanus was already aware. Even such a brutal subject as the disembowelling of Erasmus, when cloaked in Bouts's ethereal light, is invested with a certain tranquillity. Nature is no longer an artificial decor, an obviously false theatrical backdrop, as it appears in 15th century Italian painting, but an atmosphere rendered down to the finest detail, where close attention has been paid to every nuance of colour

42775-3martyr.jpg	This painting is on the wall of the chancel (presbytery) of the church of San Sebastiano.Veronese devoted special care to the decoration of the presbytery of the church, which has two long, dynamic paintings on the sides (Sts Mark and Marcellinus Being Led to Martyrdom; Martyrdom of St Sebastian) and a splendid painting on the high altar (Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints).This scene of the martyrdom of St Sebastian is unusual  in that the saint is not shown pierced with arrows but in an earlier moment of his martyrdom, when he is stripped and flogged. Having miraculously survived the torment of the arrows in the altarpiece with the saint on the column, the resolute Sebastian repeats his confession of the Christian faith.

16174-00view.jpg	"This extensive depiction of the Last Judgment in the west of the church is dominated by the large Christ in Majesty at its centre. The twelve apostles sit to His left and to His right. Here the two levels divide: the heavenly host appears above, people plunge into the maw of hell below, or are led by angels towards heaven.The way this large fresco is divided into registers is traditional. But if we look at Giotto's invention in detail, then his novel attempts at visualizing different spheres, as well as abstract beliefs, become particularly apparent. In the center of the representation, Christ is enthroned as supreme Judge in a rainbow-colored mandorla. The deep, radiant gold background, the style of painting, and the delicate substance give the impression that the heavens have opened in order to reveal the powerful, extremely solidly modelled figure of Christ. Different levels are likewise alluded to when the choirs of angels disappear behind the real window, or when the celestial watch in the upper area of the picture rolls back the firmament, behind which the golden-red doors of the heavenly Jerusalem shine forth. The black and red maw of hell, which seems to anticipate Dante's ""Inferno"", is different again in its impact.The way in which Giotto establishes a connection between the present-day world of the faithful and the world beyond all time, the world of the Last Judgment, contains another interesting detail. The donor Scrovegni, still alive at the time, kneels next to those being resurrected and offers ""his"" church to the three Marys, assisted by a priest. The latter is portrayed in a most lively manner: his robes hang - painted quite illusionistically - over the arch of the portal"

21948-4lastsu2.jpg	The photo was taken after the recent restoration.There are differing opinions amongst art researchers as to which episode from the Gospels is depicted in the Last Supper. Some consider it to portray the moment at which Jesus has announced the presence of a traitor and the apostles are all reacting with astonishment, others feel that it also represents the introduction of the celebration of the Eucharist by Jesus, who is pointing to the bread and wine with his hands. And yet others feel it depicts the moment when Judas, by reaching for the bread at the same moment as Jesus as related in the Gospel of St Luke (22:21), reveals himself to be the traitor. In the end, none of the interpretations is convincing.Leonardo's Last Supper is not a depiction of a simple or sequential action, but interweaves the individual events narrated in the Gospels, from the announcement of the presence of a traitor to the introduction of the Eucharist, to such an extent that the moment depicted is a meeting of the two events. As a result, the disciples' reactions relate both to the past and subsequent events. At the same time, however, the introduction of the Eucharist clearly remains the central event.The Apostles from left to right: Bartholomew, James the Less, Andrew, Judas, Peter, John, Christ, Thomas, James the Greater, Philip, Matthew, Thaddeus, Simon

28859-v_carmel.jpg	Moretto was a painter influenced by Lombard naturalism but he preferred the intimate, muted study of reality characteristic of Foppa, Borgognone and Savoldo to the exuberant realism of Romanino. Among the greatest works of his youth can certainly be placed the 'Virgin of Carmel' who is presented in the powerful and carefully gauged monumentally of a Madonna of Mercy with the figures of the Carmelites the Blessed Angelo and St. Simon Stock at her sides and a crowd of devotees below, probably members of the Brescian family the Ottoboni.The conspicuously earthly nature of the figures imparts to the celestial apparition a feeling of everyday reality, rendered with ineffable naturalness by the quiet light which defines poses, gestures, spiritual feelings themselves with such plastic objectivity. This 'bourgeois' view of appearances marks the role of primary importance played by Moretto in Lombard realism which was to see Michelangelo Caravaggio as its greatest proponent around the end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth

Once she has made the requisite offerings for ritual purification and presented her son, the next woman, already visible with her child in her arms below the altar, will ascend the steps to the priest.

20099-25hooch.jpg	The glory of de Hooch's genre painting is largely found in his enchanting representations of homely scenes in which a mother or maid and a children appear in an interior or a courtyard in some domestic occupation. These works, which express Dutch ideals of caring for children and the home, strike a tender note, free from sentimentality. They help us understand why his reputation is unshakable. Children play an important role in his pictures; it will be recalled, Vermeer, the father of fifteen, never painted a child.This painting shows some influence of the Rembrandt school, in the warmth and depth of the colouring, in the golden tonality, in the broad treatment of the figures, and in the impasto passage on the white fur. The intense reddish-orange of the woman's bodice, of the skirt hanging on the wall, and of the cradle cover are contrasted with the blue and grey in her coat, the bed curtain, the floor tiles, and the jug on the right.De Hooch's use of the 'doorkijkje', the device also employed by Nicolaes Maes of opening the vista from one room to another, and then again from there into the street is not a mere play with perspective; in his paintings it adds a pictorial and psychological note of some significance. De Hooch sensed that in daily life one often experiences a pleasant relief when a relationship between indoor and outdoor space is established by the widened outlook and by the enrichment of light and atmosphere which it brings. In his refinement of the 'doorkijkje' device, as well as in other respects, de Hooch shows his own character

15169-annunci.jpg	This small panel, which combines the rigour of perspective construction with embellishments of pronounced courtly inspiration, is generally dated to around the year 1425, the year in which the painter, en route to Rome at the invitation of Pope Martin V Colonna (1417-51), spent a period of residence in Florence, where he was to create some of his greatest masterpieces.The scene takes place in a room enclosed on three sides and opened in front as if by a portico. The room is lit by little rose windows and other windows of elaborate Gothic design. A frieze of miniature trefoil arches runs along the upper cornice of the room, defining the front edge of its coffered ceiling. An open arched doorway, through which the angel enters, admits to a garden, in which trees laden with fruit can be glimpsed to the far left. The Virgin is startled by the angel's annunciation as she sits, hands folded in her lap and open prayer book beside her, on an L-shaped settle, richly ornamented with intarsia panels in the shape of diamonds, lozenges, and intersecting circles

36648-dianacte.jpg	Ovid describes at length (Met. 3:138-253) how the young prince Actaeon, hunting in the forest, stumbled accidentally upon the grotto where Diana and her companion were bathing.

31772-sophonis.jpg	Sophonisba was the daughter of a Carthaginian general at the time of the second Punic war. She married a prince of neighbouring Numidia, allied to Rome, and succeeded in alienating him from his Roman masters. But he was captured by another Numidian leader Masinissa, who in turn fell in love with Sophonisba, and likewise married her. To prevent the loss of a second ally from the same cause the Roman general Scipio demanded that she be surrendered and sent captive to Rome. Her husband, not daring to defy Scipio, sent her a cup of poison which she drank.Sophonisba's death is a popular theme among Baroque painters of Italy and northern Europe

02487-1seaso1.jpg	This painting in Madrid could have been originally part of the Viennese series of Four Seasons. Arcimboldo painted it in 1563 for Archduke Maximilian (later Emperor Maximilian II). The picture arrived in Spain possibly as a gift to King Philip II.Of all the season-heads, Spring offers less surprises than the other three season allegories. The form of the head is simply filled out with flowers, the breast with leaves. At the same time, however, Spring surpasses all of Arcimboldo's composite heads in its richness of species. 80 different varieties of flowering plants can be counted.

El Greco treated all three, and ten different compositions by the artist can be differentiated, some half-length, some full-length, some showing the saint alone, others with a companion.In this painting St Francis meditates not so much on mortality (signified by the skull) as on the sacrifice of Christ.

33521-35portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 341.This large Portrait of a Young Woman with a Fan is a pendant to the Portrait of a Man Rising from his Chair (Bredius 172). The paintings were separated some time before 1793.In Holland, the design of pendant (or pair) portraits remained conservative through the 1620s, in part drawing on the heritage of Spanish court portraiture, and in part on the more recent influence of formal models from England. The present portraits, in which the figures are presented to the viewer and connected with each other in inventive way, represent Rembrandt's departure from the conservative norm. His experiments in this vein were partly inspired by Anthony van Dyck.In the present painting, Rembrandt takes over from Van Dyck the confident pose, full modelling of the black satin dress, and the hint of movement in the figure. By spreading out the woman's hands and positioning her shoulders parallel to the picture plane, Rembrandt introduces that element of pictorial surprise which is so characteristic of him. The companion portrait of the woman's husband, now in Cincinnati, which shows him rising from his chair and extending his hand in a gesture of welcome, is even more startling

07262-canal712.jpg	This view was commissioned by Lord Brooke, and until relatively recently remained in Warwick Castle. Canaletto contrasts the towering medieval battlements with a view of a few of the houses in the town at the left. The brilliant blue sky seems to be based on his experience of a southern climate, rather than English conditions. The visitors, servants and dogs in the foreground, effectively provide anecdotal interest, while the bright colours of their clothes act as a foil for the dull stonework of the building.Canaletto also made a companion picture for the painting (also in the Birmingham museum), which perfectly complements it, as a depiction of the same side of the castle from the interior lawn. He has filled this canvas, from left to right, with Guy's Tower, the Clock Tower over the entrance gate, and Caesar's Tower

11650-3doctor2.jpg	In the painted niches at the attic level stand eight monumental figures wearing Byzantine vestments and identified by Greek inscriptions. They are bare-headed and wear halos. Closest to the chancel are Sts Basil, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nazianzus, venerated as hierarchs in Eastern Church. Secondary to them are the doctors of the church Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus, as well as the church fathers Athanasius the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. The eighth figure is St Nicolas of Myra.The patriarchs' bright colours and animated faces have been traced to Venetian precedents; however, the pattern for the overall arrangement could have been the fifteenth-century papal portraits in the Sistine Chapel. The distinct shadows the figures cast on the wall are prefigured there.The picture shows the niche which is located above the scene of Building of the Grottaferrata Monastery.

Their gestures seem to pave the way for the most intense impression of grief, the embrace and gaze of the mother.

08201-portyoun.jpg	Early Venetian portraiture is well illustrated by the Portrait of a Young Man by Vincenzo Catena. Characteristic of the tradition of portraiture established by Catena's master Bellini is the bust-length format with a blue-sky background. The painting shows the sitter in the austere, formal dress of Venice's governing class with just a hint of luxury provided by the fur lining that peeps out from under his black robe. The sitter's features are described with delicate precision, and are made to appear convincingly three-dimensional through careful modelling in light and shade. The rigid symmetry of the composition lends the sitter a certain dignity, but it precludes any effect of movement. The scale is smaller than life, and the picture is painted on wood, with smooth, virtually invisible brushstrokes

37892-cityatla.jpg	Whistler's followers included Theodore Roussel, Paul Maitland, Walter Richard Sickert and the young Wilson Steer - that is, the artists widely considered the leading British Impressionists. With Sidney Starr they split off from the New English Art Club. This sub-group used the label London Impressionists. The driving force was Sickert who outlined the task facing British Impressionism: to record the magic and poesy that lay all around in everyday life. London, the great metropolis, provided all the stimulating subject-matter that was necessary.The concentration on London subject-matter was apparent in the work of Sickert, Starr, Roussel and the latter's pupil Maitland. Urban problems resulting from 19th-century expansion in the cities - such as unemployment, poverty, child labour, alcoholism and prostitution -  were almost totally absent from this art.

26631-01_1pr2.jpg	In Joel the state of inspiration, expressed by the light scrolls unfurled like a pennon and the flaming hair, has taken the place of acquired knowledge. The book is under the Prophet's feet, half hidden by the steep folds of his garment. The genii flanking the magnificent head re-enact the process: while one of them closes his book and raptly gazes across the Prophet's shoulder, the other brings his folio and acts as the devil's advocate and the spokesman of mere intellectual learning. Joel's shock is emphasized by a shifting of his body axis to the left. We find this grandiose diagonal movement again in the other giants: in Ezekiel, Daniel, and even more pronounced in Jonah. Joel in particular foresaw the coming of the Holy Ghost, and it is as though he shrank back before the consuming flame by which he none the less longs to be devoured. The lineal treatment of the Roman head - giving it the air of the mighty poet whom the High Renaissance failed to produce - carries to new heights the art form used by Signorelli

16937-monfor.jpg	The most brilliant work from the early period of van der Goes  is the Monforte Altarpiece, named after the town in which it was housed, in a college belonging to a group of Spanish Jesuits, before being subsequently transferred to the Berlin museum. It is a large-scale triptych, of which only the central panel, a long horizontal rectangle, has survived to the present day. A group of hovering angels have been amputated from the top of the panel, and the two wings have disappeared. The theme of the surviving picture is the adoration of the Magi.The Three Kings and their followers come upon the Virgin, the Holy Infant and Joseph amid the ruins of a palace. A group of villagers observe this extraordinary scene through a gap in the wall. The figures, both actors and witnesses, are all shown on the same scale, whether humble or magnificent. They are neither reticent nor exalted, but react to the event in their various ways, surprised or self-conscious. In the background we can see a few women, some cottages and a river besides which the Kings' horses are waiting. In the foreground, symbolic flowers - the lily and columbine - and a pottery vessel are depicted with great care. A tiny squirrel is running along one of the beams above the opening through which the villagers observe the scene. Van der Goes has given free rein to his imagination, both in the composition and in his handling of paint, deploying the splendidly rich colours that are so characteristic of his art, mixing blazing reds with the most delicately nuanced shades

05044-portman.jpg	The sitter for this portrait was identified as a member of the patrician Cappello family of Venice, more specifically Giovanni Cappello (d. 1499), a senator and procurator of San Marco from 1466.The gray-haired patrician is depicted wearing a scarlet gown lined with a fur at the neck, a black stole over his shoulders, and a black cap. The artist successfully juggled the formal elements of portraiture current among his innovative contemporaries working in northern Italy, such as the beautifully described parapet, with its illusionistic cartellino, the forceful projection of the figure against the dark, neutral background, and the volumetric three-quarter view.There is a black chalk drawing in Vienna, directly related to this portrait. It is more vigorous than the painting and this led to the suggestion by some critics that the drawing was created by Mantegna for Bonsignori's use. However, the drawing is generally believed to be by Bonsignori himself

39824-2rovere2.jpg	In creating a pair of paintings of Francesco Maria della Rovere and Eleonora Gonzaga, duke and duchess of Urbino, Titian predictably reprised many of the themes seen in Piero della Francesca's double portrait of their predecessors, Federico da Montefeltre and Battista Sforza. Once again, the male portrait is more rugged and individualized, emphasizing military exploits and adventures. Francesco Maria poses alert in his stunningly rendered, glinting armor, his right arm and baton dramatically thrust out into the viewer's space. Behind him a splendid, plumed parade helmet, reflecting the vibrant, pulsating red of a velvet drape, faces a jauntily angled set of lances. In marked contrast, Eleonora Gonzaga sits primly in her chair, immobile within her highly detailed but much less lovingly depicted court dress. Her pet dog lies bored on a table in front of a window. Titian's landscape is expansive but untraversible, marked by a church tower in its idealized blue distance

39081-04venus.jpg	To enter fully the radiant world of Tiepolo we must travel - to Venice, his native city, then back to the mainland to Udine and Vicenza, across the Alps to W�rzburg in Bavaria, finally to Madrid in Spain where, fearing the shift of taste in his homeland, he elected to spend the last years of his life. The greatest decorative painter of his century, he was happiest working in fresco where his 'rapid and resolute' manner was a technical necessity. Under his virtuoso brush airy spaces, shimmering with light, opened on walls and ceilings to admit heroic beings - Christian, mythological, allegorical, historic or poetic - dazzling to mortal viewers. He has been called the last Renaissance painter, and borrowed much from Veronese. But Tiepolo, even more than Veronese, was never wholly serious when painting epic. He can be majestic but not solemn; poignant rather than tragic. In the century which discovered feminine sensibility, he introduced a note of tenderness into the sternest and loftiest imagery.Luckily for us, something of the freshness of Tiepolo's mural decorations is preserved in his oil sketches and in this canvas, painted to be inserted into the ceiling of a room in one of the many Venetian palaces of the Contarini family. It is designed to be seen from below, but at an angle, as we step through the door. From infinitely luminous skies, Venus, sumptuous in her white, gold and pink nudity, has swooped down in her chariot; her team of doves, released from harness flutter lovingly above her, and from a dawn-tinted cloud the Three Graces strew roses. Below, winged Cupid, her divine son, hovers with his quiverful of arrows. Venus has come to consign her newly born child, freshly washed with water from an earthenware amphora, to Father Time. Having set down his scythe, Time here signifies eternity rather than mortality. The child - wide-eyed, thick-lipped and with a precocious widow's peak in his hairline - resembles page boys frescoed by Tiepolo shortly before on the staircase of the prince-bishop's palace in W�rzburg. He is clearly meant to be a real baby. Venus' only human child, born to a mortal father, was Aeneas the founder of Rome. The Contarini, one of the oldest families in Venice, had fabricated for themselves a lineage from ancient Rome; the reference to Aeneas thus suggests that the ceiling may have been commissioned to proclaim the birth of a son. Through august parentage and his own heroic deeds, a Contarini boy might be expected, like Aeneas, to win eternal fame

It has three autograph versions.  Formerly the panel was attributed to David Vinckboons.The painting depicts the Flemish celebration of Whitsuntide, which took place the week following Pentecost, or Whitsunday, and commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples. In Flanders, village members would collect Pinksterbloem - the Whitsun flower - and with them adorn a chosen young girl, the Whitsun Bride, along with her young attendants. As is depicted here in a typical Brueghel fashion, the decorated girls are paraded through the village as they sing songs about the Whitsun flowers

But there were other currents as well. The Lombard painters Ceruti and Ghislandi, the Genoese artist Magnasco, Crespi from Bologna and Traversi from Naples (in addition of course Giandomenico Tiepolo in Venice) all adopted different but equally lively approaches. These artists paid close attention to themes and people taken from everyday life, which later led to the strand of ""social"" painting of the second half of the nineteenth century.

16733-oratory1.jpg	In 1518 a new project brought together three Sienese painters, Sodoma, Beccafumi and Girolamo del Pacchia. The new project was a scheme of fresco paintings to embellish the interior of a meeting room belonging to one of the city's oldest confraternities - the Confraternity of Santa Maria degli Angeli della Veste Nera (Saint Mary of the Angels and of the Black Robes). Founded in honour of the Virgin after 1450 the confraternity also adopted Bernardino as one of their saints, adding his name to the confraternity's title. For this reason the room that painters decorated is now known as the Oratory of San Bernardino. Designed as a place where the members of the confraternity would meet to conduct both their collective devotions and their administrative business, the Oratory of San Bernardino offers a rare example of an early sixteenth-century decorative ensemble that has survived in almost its original form.On the side walls of the room there is a series of large-scale fresco paintings separated from one another by pilasters decorated with candelabra motifs. The paintings consist of narrative scenes from the life of the Virgin. Girolamo del Pacchia, who was a member of the confraternity, had been assigned the paintings of the Birth of the Virgin and the Annunciation. Girolamo del Pacchia provided his patrons with paintings whose style reflects that of earlier altarpieces commissioned from him by patrons in and around Siena. Their stylistic idiom also demonstrates an appreciation of Sodoma's earlier Sienese work, as well as that of other contemporary painters based in Florence and Rome. In the Birth of the Virgin Girolamo appears to have studied Andrea del Sarto's painting of this subject in the forecourt of the church of the Santissima Annunziata in Florence, adopting the generously proportioned figures and ample draperies of the women visitors in this fresco completed some four years earlier

""The Market of Kecskem�t in Winter"" was painted during this period. In the background there are a Franciscan church and a baroque Calvary church inspired artists. Iv�nyi applied this motif in several pictures at the same time (e.g. ""The  Market-Square in Kecskem�t"", ""The Market in Kecskem�t"", a sketch, and ""Market-Women among Snow-Hills"", etc.). A more and more abstarct and stylized presentation can be followed in his sketches. Iv�nyi's picture is between naturalism and presentation in plane: perspectives and shadows suggestive of space are still present. The symmetric composition indicates an abstract way of looking at the world: the location of trees without leaves and patches of red in the greyish background on both sides of the picture.

07171-canal214.jpg	This painting belongs to the second pair of the four paintings ordered by Stefano Conti in 1725 from Canaletto. In this painting a medieval church takes centre stage. The view from the quay of the Rio della Carit&#224; (which has since been filled in) and over the bridge, shows the sturdy, fifteenth-century brick fa�ade of Santa Maria della Carit&#224;, which now belongs to the Gallerie dell'Accademia. Barely visible, at the far right, is the fa�ade of the monastery of the Lateran canons, to which the church belonged. The eye is led along the Grand Canal to its estuary in the Bacino near the Punta della Dogana. Beside the tower, which collapsed in 1741, the dome of the Salute rises a short distance above the small annex of the church.Thematically, the present canvas and the Santi Giovanni e Paolo and the Scuola di San Marco, also representing a medieval church, form a lovely pair next to the two views of the Grand Canal, but it is unclear to what extent this was actually intended.In this painting as well, the field of vision covers an angle of approximately ninety degrees. We may assume that Canaletto again began by making at least two topographical drawings on the spot, combining them in a single composition back in his studio

21574-tobias.jpg	In this small painting Lastman depicts the Biblical story, very popular in the circle of Elsheimer whose influence can be seen on this picture, too.The story is recounted in the Book of Tobit. Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight

03584-01ventur.jpg	The Palazzo Venturi (later Palazzo Agostini then Palazzo Casini-Casuccini, now Palazzo Bindi Sergardi) is a palace in the Via dei Pellegrini, just a few steps from the Campo in Siena. Beccafumi painted here, on the ceiling in a room on the second floor, a fresco cycle with eight scenes of exemplary deeds of ancient heroes, ten medallions with scenes from ancient mythology and history, as well as twenty famous women of antiquity. The room now belongs to a private apartment.The commission came from a member of the Venturi family. It is not clear whether Beccafumi was originally supposed to paint the walls, or at least the lunettes, in addition to the ceiling frescoes visible today. Vasari, who was the first to describe and praise the frescoes in his Vite (1550), named Marcello Agostini as the owner of the palace.The form of the ceiling vault, with three spandrels  on the long walls and two on the short ones, suggested an articulation based on a type familiar to Beccafumi from Rome, where he had studied the frescoes in the Villa Farnesina.Besides the two central paintings there are three cycles with different themes, each of which is meant to be observed separately: ancient history in the six octagons that surround the central paintings, ten mythological depictions in the oculi, and twenty women in the lower corners of the spandrels, several  of whom immediately recognizable as famous heroines of antiquity

17962-03fortu2.jpg	Benozzo began his stay in Montefalco (Umbria) in the second half of 1449. There he at first worked in the monastery church of San Fortunato, renovated in 1446, which is situated 1,2 km outside the town on the road to Spoleto. Only fractions now remain of the cycle of frescoes dating from 1450. A lunette fresco of the Madonna and Child between St Francis and St Bernadine of Siena above the entrance portal has survived. On the right altar there was originally a painting of the church's patron saint, St Fortunatus Enthroned, but it was severely damaged in the 17th century when the altar was renovated. What has survived is the enthroned saint who, as usual, appears as a priest with a tonsure wearing a chasuble and holding a flowering staff in his right hand. The staff is a reference to his legend, according to which Fortunatus used it to drive oxen. When it was placed on his grave, the staff began to flower.Fortunatus, who was born in Spoleto in about 400, converted the area around Montefalco. He is the patron saint of this town, and depictions of him are only found in the local area

44614-venicese.jpg	The much-feared Consiglio dei Dieci (Council of Ten) was responsible for Venice's security. Its meeting-place, the Sala del Consiglio dei Dieci is the first of a series of rooms used for the administration of justice.

Zelotti's oval painting is one of the nine surviving paintings in the ceiling. (The tenth was confiscated by the art commissars of Napoleon and removed to Paris. Now it is replaced by a copy.)Regarding the oval paintings in the ceiling, Zelotti could match Veronese for colour and light, but his allegories tend to be rather clumsy, as can be seen in this painting

43977-0sevens.jpg	The subject of this triptych is the Seven Sacraments. Of the Christian sacraments - acts conferring grace - Protestants generally recognize two, Baptism and Communion, and the Catholics seven, which comprise, in addition, Confirmation, Penance (Confession), Extreme Unction, Holy Orders and Matrimony, the last two still being mutually exclusive. They are seen on medieval fonts and as altarpiece cycles in early Netherlandish painting, where the subject seems to have had greater appeal, at least until the 17th century. The triptych of Rogier van der Weyden is a good example of these altarpieces.We see an acuteness of observation in the Altar of the Sacraments. The Calvary sequence takes place in the interior of a light, spacious church, whose carefully executed details immediately catch the viewer's eye. The seven sacraments are presented around the central crucifixion group accompanied by an angel with a banderole. The importance of the action in the central panel is emphasised by the size of the depicted personages compared to the figures in the side panels. The emotion of the central characters - Saint John and the three Marys - who are overcome with grief, is a characteristic feature of Van der Weyden's art. It is thought that the triptych was commissioned in 1441 by the Bishop of Tournai, Jean Chevrot, for the altar of his private chapel. Van der Weyden portrays him on the left of the painting, as the bishop administering Confirmation.Van der Weyden was probably helped by his assistants during the execution of the Altar of the Sacraments

Nevertheless, it shows a scene of tenderness and joy as the Christ Child, watched over by his mother Mary, his grandmother Anne and his earthly father Joseph, places a wedding ring on the finger of the princess Catherine while his little cousin, the child Baptist, plays with his attribute of a lamb.

Maria Novella in Florence, dated 1566&#151;68 and also executed by Andrea da Firenze.Mary stands to the left of the cross, her hands joined in a mournful gesture, gazing at her son. The figure of Saint John the Evangelist at the right is depicted in a slightly more active posture of mourning than the motionless Virgin. He has his hands joined in front of his chest, and his look toward Christ expresses sorrow and disbelief. A Dominican friar kneels at the foot of the cross, embracing it, while his lips appear to be kissing the feet of Christ.Two angels are at either side of the cross; they also mourn. The left angel has covered his face with part of his garment, and the right angel is supporting his head with his hand. Angels that are able to express emotions first appear in works by Giotto. Their depiction soon became very popular in trecento painting"

03858-137alle1.jpg	The four panels with Allegories at the Accademia in Venice are often likened to the Sacred Allegory, but they belong instead to the artist's scanty secular production. They originally formed part of a small dressing-table with a mirror and a rack on which to hang objects, belonging to the painter Vincenzo Catena who, writing his will in 1530, left it to Antonio Marsili. The spread of this kind of furniture was so great that in 1489 the Venetian Senate prohibited its manufacture, limiting it to what was strictly necessary. Often, as in this instance, their decoration comprised symbolic representations of a moralistic character.An unusual theme for Bellini, the panels represent respectively: Lust tempting the virtuous man or Perseverance (Bacchus who from a chariot offers a plate of fruit to a warrior); fickle Fortune (the woman on an unstable boat holding a sphere); Prudence (the naked woman pointing at a mirror); Falsehood (the man emerging from the shell). There are diverging opinions about the interpretation of the last two representations, such that they have been seen as: the Woman as Vanitas (on the basis of similar representations by Jacopo de' Barbari and Baldung Grien), and the Man in the shell as an allegory of Virtus Sapientia, since the shell might have a positive connotation as a generative principle

42875-8levi.jpg	"This work, painted for the Dominican order of SS. Giovanni e Paolo to replace an earlier work by Titian destroyed in the fire of 1571, is the last of the grandiose ""suppers"" painted by Veronese for the refectories of Venetian monasteries.The sumptuous banquet scene is framed by the great arches of a portico. Against the pale green shotsilk effect of the background architecture, the figures on either side of Christ move in a turbulence of polychromatic splendour and interaction of pose and gesture. We seem to see here the sublime notions of form and colour of Piero della Francesca. The interaction of form and colour is calculated to contain the monumental figuration within the terms of a fascinating and imaginative decorative painting.The expressive hedonism so alien to the religious context - the subject in fact appears to be a purely pagan one in exaltation of love of life in 16th century Venice - aroused the suspicions of the Inquisition. On July 18th 1573 Veronese was summoned by the Holy Office to appear before the Inquisition accused of heresy. If the questions of the inquisitors show the first signs of the rigours of the Counter-reformation, Veronese's answers show clearly his unfailing faith in the creative imagination and artistic freedom. Not wishing to yield to the injunction of the Inquisition to eliminate the details which offended the religious theme of the Last Supper, he changed the title to ""Feast in the House of Levi"", a subject which tolerated the presence of fools and armed men dressed up ""alla tedesca"""

19542-phaeton.jpg	In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. Helios drove his golden chariot, a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast, daily across the sky. Phaethon persuaded his unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po). He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.

19129-29nohad.jpg	This  painting and the Banquet of the Officers of the St George Civic Guard Company of Haarlem (Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem) are outstanding examples of how carefully Hals calculated his candid effects. He heightened the momentary quality of both pictures by interlacing the figures on the surface of the canvas and in depth. The impression is of casual irregularity, but, as in his technique, a hidden order underlies his large composition.In both banquet pieces he links up two principal groups by long diagonals, and each single group shows a central seated figure, around which the other men are arranged, some seated and some standing. The crossing of the main diagonals coincides with the head of a seated figure in the second plane, which gains through this scheme and added interest and becomes a kind of of occult centre. Ingenious variety of of position and movement relates the figures to each other or to the spectator. The final result is an unprecedented illusion of an animated gathering.The impression that these guardsmen could consume gargantuan quantities of of food and liquor is confirmed by an ordinance laid down by the municipal authorities of Haarlem in 1621. Town official took cognizance of the fact that some of the banquets of the militia lasted a whole week. Considering that the municipality had to pay the costs, and that the times were troubled (the ordinance was written after hostilities with Spain had been resumed), it was decreed that the celebrations 'were not to last longer than three, or at the most four days...'

30235-05apol2.jpg	The characteristic artist of Venetian mannerism, the young Palma (the grandson of the brother of Palma Vecchio) divided the story into two parts and painted a matching set of paintings based on it. The first picture depicts the musical contest between Apollo and Marsyas in the presence of Midas, the king of Lydia. The central character is Apollo, dressed in a red robe with his laurel-garlanded head bent over the violin. Instead of Marsyas's own instrument, the Phrygian double recorder, a syrinx or shepherd's pipe appears in the second picture in front of King Midas. He deemed its music superior to the sound of Apollo's divine instrument and was punished by growing ass's ears. The pagan flutist, however, received harsher punishment: the majestic but merciless young god is preparing to have him flayed.The landscape background with clear blue sky in both paintings evokes the world of myths, in which the happiness and cruel justice of the eternal gods coexist for the edification of the observer.Thus in this artistic conception the elements of Apollo's two musical duels are present and are even intermingled. It seems the painter did not adhere to the Ovidian source. In this time only the moral of the two episodes was important: the victory of divine stringed instruments over the sensual wind instruments

39285-7tesorie.jpg	"The Madonna dei Tesorieri (Madonna of the Treasurers) comes from the Palazzo dei Camerlenghi at Rialto. It is a votive picture commissioned by the noble magistrates Michele Pisa, Lorenzo Dolfin and Marin Malinpiero (depicted in the centre), who, with their secretaries, are paying tribute to Mary and a select court of saints, including other disguised portraits.The most recent restoration of this painting made it clear that Tintoretto has concealed in it a very sophisticated ""puzzle picture"": the strikingly light colour of Mary's white cloak falls, as if by chance, into a crescent shape. Especially from a distance, this gives the image of a ""Madonna of the Crescent Moon,"" a manner of depicting the Virgin referring back to the Revelation of St John, and emphasizing her immaculate conception: the idea that she herself came into the world free of original sin.

19234-peasants.jpg	Harmen was the son of Frans Hals. He frequently painted the amusements of the humbler classes, like in this picture. The puppet-like figures and the scene itself recall the work of Frans Hals, but this painting is more like a simplified version of one of the father's pictures, and the vigour characteristic of the latter is lacking in the work of his son.In the painting the drunken stupor of the figures in the foreground contrasts with the reeling movements of the figures still dancing in the background. The peasants are seen as ludicrous and insensitive creatures, capable only of the coarse amusements of the drunk.

09139-diane1.jpg	Only two signed paintings by Fran�ois Clouet are known to exist, of which this, generally regarded as one of the great masterpieces of the French Renaissance art, is one. The subject, shown seated in her bath, traditionally was believed to be the famous beauty, Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566), a favourite of Henry II and virtual ruler of France. However, this identification is now rejected, and the dating, placed either in the 1550s or around 1571 is debated. Diane do Poitiers. Other candidates for the identity of the sitter are Mary Stuart (Mary, Queen of Scots) and Marie Touchet, mistress to Charles IX.This is the classic portrayal of a Royal mistress in her official role, cool, beautiful, aloof, bejewelled even in her bath, accompanied by the strappings of her state: fine rooms, a noble child in the arms of its leering, accomplice-nurse, the sly Love-child stealing the fruits, the flower of passion in her hand.Regarding the several influences, Titian's influence has been cited. The motif of the servant in the background performing a domestic chore is seen as deriving from the Venus of Urbino. The painting also shows affinities to the highly polished surfaces and icy eroticism of Bronzino. The pose of the woman in the bathtub was derived from a composition by Leonardo, known as the Monna Vanna (now lost

42618-26lady.jpg	"Signature: Not signed.Provenance: The provenance of the painting is fraught with uncertainties, primarily because several times Vermeer treated the theme of a lady receiving or writing a letter while a maid is present. Thus, no. 7 in the Amsterdam sale of 1696 is described: ""A young lady who is being brought a letter by a maid, by ditto; fl 70."" It might apply to this painting, or to the Love Letter in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. The earlier provenance is therefore spotty. Sale Amsterdam, 1738. Art gallery C. Lebrun; Paris, 1807-8.

12485-10seven2.jpg	"The Flight into Egypt is one of seven scenes from the Life of Christ which originally surrounded the large central panel of the Mother of Sorrows. In the Gospel of St Matthew (Matt. 2, 13-14), the event is mentioned briefly, though narrated in more detail in the Apocrypha. King Herod ordered that all newborn sons should be killed once he had found out that a future king would be born in Judea. An angel conveys to Joseph God's message to leave the town. Thus the Holy Family fled to Egypt.The group of figures, with Mary riding and holding the Christ Child and Joseph leading the ass, is arranged parallel to the picture in the foreground, an arrangement which is repeated in the later woodcut in the Life of the Virgin. In the foreground the path is stony, and in the background a rocky landscape is visible. The rock is a sign of a safe place of refuge, but can also be interpreted as a mariological and christological symbol: ""The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner"" (Matt. 21, 42).

33400-02passio.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 550.Rembrandt received a commission from the court in about 1628 through Constantijn Huygens, secretary to the Prince of Orange, for five paintings of the Passion of Christ. The series started with the Raising of the Cross and Descent from the Cross. He was hired to create small versions of Rubens famous altarpieces in Antwerp, the Raising of the Cross and the Descent from the Cross. Huygens asked Rembrandt to produce paintings less than one-twenty-fifth the size of the Rubenses. It must also have been agreed between Huygens and Rembrandt that the artist would inset himself into the composition of the Descent from the Cross as one of the followers of Christ who eased the body to the ground. Originally the Descent from the Cross was intended to be part of a triptych but finally it became one of the five paintings in this series.The two paintings, finished in 1633 are plainly modelled on Rubens's versions of those subjects. When they were delivered in 1633, a new commission followed, for three more paintings of scenes from the Passion of Christ, The Entombment, The Resurrection and The Ascension. The first to be delivered, early in 1636, was The Ascension, the last in iconographic order. If in the Raising and Descent Rembrandt had vied with Rubens, in the Ascension he had moved back in time to the Venetian master Titian. In a composition based on one of Titian's most famous works, the Assumption of the Virgin in the Church of Frari in Venice, Rembrandt created an image of earth, sky, and heaven, with mortals taking leave of a divine creature being raised by angels to the Godhead itself.The reception of the Ascension was not enthusiastic and did not lead to new commissions from The Hague. The final two pieces from the commission of 1633, The Entombment and The Resurrection, were completed in 1639. The series was finally completed only in 1646, with a commission for two other canvases with scenes from the life of Christ as an infant, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Circumcision (now lost, it is known from a copy in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig)

19619-bonavent.jpg	Francisco de Herrera the Elder was an important member of the school of Seville. His violent technique was more daring than anything achieved by his colleagues. He excelled in depicting character. Herrera's most ambitious commission was the decoration of the church of the Franciscan Colegio de San Buenaventura. Herrera began working for the college in 1626, when he frescoed the nave and the dome of the small chapel with portraits of famous doctors of the order accompanied by painted emblems extolling the glories of their sacred learning. Upon completion of the frescoes in 1627, the patrons immediately commissioned the artist to paint six pictures of St Bonaventura's life to decorate the walls of the church. Herrera completed only four of the projected works (now owned by the Prado Museum and the Bob Jones University, Greenville, South Carolina), one of which is the St Bonaventura Enters the Franciscan Order. In Herrera arranges a row of friars diagonally in front of and altar but makes little attempt to relate the figures to each other; instead each head is individualized as though the were determined to call attention to what is, after all, a powerfully unattractive group of people

The female figure in the yellow coat in front of the pyramid is often interpreted as the personification of Princedom, while the old man with the hat behind the hieroglyphic stone seems to be a sage. The symbol of the snake entwined around a rod reminds us of the staff of Aesculapius and refers to the art of medicine.

26706-lu06jos.jpg	"""Amon begat Josiah. Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brothers around the time they were carried away to Babylon. And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel."" (Matthew 1:10-12)Josiah, the son of Amon, is usually considered to be the man depicted on the right, and Jechoniah the child that he holds on his knees, while, on the opposite side, the child's mother is believed to be holding in her arms another of the sons begotten by Josiah during the Babylonian Captivity. In this case, the family of Jechoniah with Shealtiel as a child is thought to be represented in the spandrel above.The lunette with the tablet bearing the names of Hezekiah-Manasseh-Amon, who, in the chronological order of the ancestors of Christ, come immediately before Josiah, is next to this one on the same wall, instead of on the opposite wall, as it should have been according to the distributive pattern adopted by Michelangelo for the whole cycle. The interruption of this pattern, which was subsequently followed regularly, was probably intended to draw attention to the period of exile inBabylon.For the first time, the artist established a clearly dramatic rapport between the figures in the two groups in the same lunette. In particular, this was assigned to the postures of the two children leaning eagerly toward each other with outstretched arms: the one on his father's lap holds a small object that is no longer recognizable, while the other seems to be trying to grasp it. The man suddenly turns his head with a vigorous mien that is difficult to interpret - possibly he is surprised, as his open left hand would seem to indicate - while the woman suddenly draws back, clasping her son more tightly as if to protect him better, with an expression of great alarm on her face. And, once again, the brighter colours of the woman's figure - a deep rose dress with a green scarf round her waist, a white shirt and a yellow ocher mantle - are in marked contrast with the dominant darker tones of the green cloak with violet shadows that envelops the man"

42100-19studi1.jpg	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments. Two doors, not distinguished in any way from the cupboard doors, cover the only windows: Francesco preferred to work by candlelight.The intimate scale of the project allowed Vasari and his pupils to develop their imaginative abilities, technical skill, and jewel-like delicacy of colour. Eight sculptors made the bronze statuettes, and the paintings were by twenty-four artists.

09144-king_fra.jpg	There are many singular elements in this famous portrait: the refined taste for the sumptuous dress, the precision of the colours (characteristically Flemish), the clearness of the outlines, the precision of the details (characteristically Mannerist); all aspects which do not distance the portrait-painting art of Fran�ois Clouet (son of the similarly well-known Jean) from that of the Fontainebleau school. Clouet's Mannerism is not derived from an imitation of Florentine painters, such as Bronzino, but is rather a spontaneous Mannerism, and therefore fresher and more vital, assimilated from some great master of the north, faithful to a great realism and the precision of the modelling.The identification of the person portrayed as Francis I of France is relatively recent (1769). It is based mainly on the concrete possibility that the painting arrived in Florence with the rich dowry of Christine of Lorraine, grand-daughter and heir of Catherine de' Medici, the queen of France

05314-01tripty.jpg	The inner wings of this altarpiece are occupied by the kneeling figures of the donors, husband and wife, attended by their patron saints Peter and Agnes. The coats of arms behind them identify the couple as members of the Bronckhorst and Bosshuyse families, but nothing is known of these names which would help determine the date of the work or its original destination.The central panel displays the adoration of the Christ Child by the three Kings or Magi. The Infant Christ sits solemnly enthroned on his mother's lap. The Virgin and Child resemble a cult statue beneath its baldachin, and the Magi approach with all the gravity of priests in a religious ceremony. The splendid crimson mantle of the kneeling King echoes the monumental figure of the Virgin. That Bosch intended to show a parallel between the homage of the Magi and the celebration of the Mass is clearly indicated by the gift which the oldest King has placed at the feet of the Virgin: it is a small sculptured image of the Sacrifice of Isaac, a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice on the Cross. Other Old Testament episodes appear on the elaborate collar of the second King, representing the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, and on the Moorish King's silver orb, depicting Abner offering homage to David.A group of peasants have gathered around the stable at the right. They peer from behind the wall with lively curiosity and scramble up to the roof in order to get a better view of the exotic strangers. The Shepherds had seen Christ on Christmas Eve, but they frequently reappear as spectators in fifteenth-century Epiphany scenes. Generally, however, they display much more reverence than do Bosch's peasants, whose boisterous behaviour contrasts strongly with the dignified bearing of the Magi.The most curious detail of Bosch's Epiphany is the man standing just inside the stable behind the Magi. Naked except for a thin shirt and a crimson robe gathered around his loins, he wears a bulbous crown; a gold bracelet encircles one arm, and a transparent cylinder covers a sore on his ankle. He regards the Christ Child with an ambiguous smile, but the faces of several of his companions appear distinctly hostile.Because they stand within the dilapidated stable, time-honoured symbol of the Synagogue, these grotesque figures have been identified as Herod and his spies, or Antichrist and his counsellors. Although neither identification is quite convincing, the association of the chief figure with the powers of darkness is clearly suggested by the demons embroidered on the strip of cloth hanging between his legs. A row of similar forms can be seen on the large object which he holds in one hand; surprisingly, this can only be the helmet of the second King, and still other monsters decorate the robes of the Moorish King and his servant. These demonic elements undoubtedly refer to the pagan past of the Magi.The stable and its inhabitants seem to be the source of the malevolent influences contaminating almost every part of the majestic landscape which unfolds in the background of all three panels. Demons haunt the ruined portal in the left wing, where Joseph sits hunched over a fire. The crumbling walls around him are the remains of King David's palace, near which the Nativity was popularly supposed to have occurred; like the stable, it represents the Synagogue, the Old Law collapsing at the advent of the New. In the field beyond, peasants dance to the sound of bagpipes, a familiar symbol of the carnal life. On the right wing, wolves attack a man and a woman on a desolate road. Behind the stable in the centre, the followers of two of the Magi rush towards each other like opposing armies; the host of the third King appears beyond the sand dunes. The gently rolling countryside contains, in addition, an abandoned tavern and a pagan idol. Even the distant grey-blue walls of Jerusalem, one of Bosch's most evocative renderings of the Holy City, appear vaguely sinister. A little roadside cross leans precariously to one side at the left, and the two watch-towers are architecturally similar to the demonic city which Bosch depicted in the St Anthony triptych in Lisbon.The frame of the triptych is original

09529-saul_wit.jpg	Seventeenth-century artists often made remarkable use of the contrast between foreground and background. A small image in the background provided the key to the meaning of the principal scene. Among those who employed this device were Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer. An early example is found in this painting by Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen, Saul and the Witch of Endor, in which several episodes from the biblical story are depicted in a simultaneous narrative, while the clue to the scene is hidden in the distance.In order to unravel this puzzling picture one has to be familiar with the Old Testament story found in the first book of Samuel, especially chapters 28 and 31, which relates that Saul, the first king of the people of Israel, was counseled by the priest Samuel for many years. Eventually, though, Saul rejected him and began acting in defiance of God's commands, whereupon God charged Samuel with the task of finding a new king for Israel. The choice fell on David, but Saul refused to accept him. He was confronted with mounting difficulties, one of which was a disastrous war with the Philistines. Just before the decisive battle, Saul decided to consult a fortune-teller to seek the advice of the dead Samuel.On the far left, Saul and several of his men arrive to consult the witch, with the tents of Saul's army in the background. The sorceress, half naked and seated in a magic circle, summons a witches' sabbath. This foreground scene does not come from the Bible, although the latter does refer to the witch's magical arts. Witches flying through the skies on a ram, like the one in the right background, were a symbol of the devil in the late middle ages, and it was with their help that the witch could harness secret forces. Through the gateway in the centre one sees Samuel emerging from his grave, rebuking Saul for disturbing the repose of the dead. In the distance is the real key to the meaning of the picture: the battle that Saul lost, after which he committed suicide by falling on his sword. Saul's godless desire to know the future, which led him to disturb the dead, proved fatal.

32859-parnass.jpg	"The third composition for the Stanza della Segnatura represents Parnassus, the dwelling place of Apollo and the Muses and the home of poetry, according to classical myth.Mount Parnassus, the home of Apollo, is, like the hill of the Vatican, a place where in ancient times there was a shrine to Apollo dedicated to the arts. This has a direct bearing on the picture because through the window on the wall where the fresco is painted there is a view of the Cortile del Belvedere and the hill of the Vatican. There were newly discovered classical sculptures in the Cortile, such as the Ariadne that Raphael used as a model for the muse to the left of Apollo.Apollo plays a lira da braccio (an anachronism which, according to some, was meant to symbolize the perpetual value of the poetic message). He sits under a laurel grove with the nine Muses (who personify the nine types of art). The most eminent classical and contemporary poets are depicted together in a harmonic ascending and descending movement from left to right. Homer is flanked by Virgil and Dante, Ovid and Horace are next to Sappho, while from the ""ranks"" of moderns we can identify Petrarch, Boccaccio and Ariosto. Petrarch is recognizable in the group in the left foreground; so is Sappho, who holds a scroll bearing her name; Ennius is seated above them, listening to the song of the blind Homer (who appears as a protagonist, like Apollo), behind him stands Dante, who had also appeared in the Disputa as a theologist, evidently because of the doctrinal content of the Divine Comedy. Some see the portrait of Michelangelo in the bearded figure immediately to the right of the central group, although it is more readily identified with Tebaldeo or Castiglione, for the scene is, after all, a celebration of poetry.Raphael in several sketches significantly changed some of the details, including the musical instruments used. In the early versions Apollo played on a traditional stylized classical lyre, but this fresco shows him playing a Renaissance lira da braccio with a bow. The bow was unknown in Antiquity, although later they attributed its invention to Sappho. It has nine, instead of seven, strings to match the number of Muses; this, in Raphael's conception, signifies timelessness, just as the fact that the classical and contemporary poets are depicted together.While working on this fresco, the artist may have become acquainted with that ancient sarcophagus from Asia Minor which is adorned with the relief sculpture of the nine Muses. This was his source for the three additional instruments shown in this fresco: Erato's kithara, to the right of Apollo, the Lydian aulos of Eutherpe, on the other side, and below, the strange, tortoise-shell lyre of Sappho - all of which he rendered striving for archeological accuracy.In this fresco, music fills the role of moving force behind the Apollonian universe, at the same time being the symbol of poetry.Compositional harmony and visual counterpoint characterize the fresco: the groups of figures are bound together by continuous lines and the single characters are represented in opposed but corresponding poses. Although the Parnassus lacks the high originality of the School of Athens, it demonstrates Raphael's illustrative ability. It is enriched by classical elements which must have held great appeal for a cultural class excited by the recent archaeological discoveries. Thus we must add Raphael's capacity to interpret contemporary taste to his genuine artistic skills"

A contribution of Angelico's pupils can be assumed.The composition of this fresco is severe in the extreme. The Virgin inhabits not a house but a cell as Spartan as that in which the fresco is painted, and beyond Gabriel and Mary the eye meets only a plain blank wall. The one piece of decoration, the capital of the column, is deliberately obscured by the wing of the angel.

19918-05norfol.jpg	Thomas Howard (1473-1554) was a powerful English noble who held a variety of high offices under King Henry VIII. Although he was valuable to the King as a military commander, he failed in his aspiration to become the chief minister of the realm.Howard was the brother-in-law of King Henry VII and the son of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. In May 1513 he became lord high admiral, and on September 9 he helped rout the Scots at Flodden Field near Branxton, Northumberland. He became lord deputy of Ireland in 1520 but soon left this post to command a fleet against the French.Succeeding his father as Duke of Norfolk in 1524, he headed the faction opposed to Henry's chief minister, Thomas Wolsey. Upon Wolsey's fall in 1529, Norfolk became president of the royal council. He supported the marriage of his niece Anne Boleyn to Henry in 1533, but, by the time of Anne's fall in 1536, his relationship to Henry had already been weakened by the rise of Thomas Cromwell. As lord high steward, Norfolk was assigned to preside at her trial and execution. He momentarily regained royal favour by skillfully suppressing the rebellion of Roman Catholics in northern England known as the Pilgrimage of Grace (1536). A conservative in religion, Norfolk became a leading opponent of two influential church reformers: the king's chief adviser, Thomas Cromwell, and the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer. Upon Cromwell's execution (1540) Norfolk emerged as the second most powerful man in England, but his position was again weakened when Henry's fifth wife, Catherine Howard - another of Norfolk's nieces - was put to death in 1542.In December 1546 Norfolk was accused of being an accessory to the alleged treasonable activities of his son, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. Surrey was executed and Norfolk condemned, but before the sentence could be carried out Henry VIII died (January 1547). Norfolk remained in prison during the reign of the Protestant king Edward VI (reigned 1547-53); in August 1553, following the accession of Queen Mary (reigned 1553-58), a Roman Catholic, he was released and restored to his dukedom. He died in 1554 after failing to suppress the uprising, led by Sir Thomas Wyat, protesting the marriage of Mary I to King Philip of Spain

44176-coastal.jpg	Adam Willaerts was one of the followers of Hendrick Vroom who painted historical and quasi-historical maritime events in his style. Born in Antwerp, he settled in Utrecht early in the 17th century and spent the rest of his life there. By the time of his death he had seen what artists of the tonal classical phase of Dutch painting had accomplished. His own works began to show a shift in style with their lower viewpoints and more muted colour harmonies. In addition to the standard repertoire of Vroom's followers his oeuvre includes traditional biblical subjects related to the sea (Jonah and the whale, the miraculous draught of fishes, Christ preaching on the Sea of Galilee), beach scenes with busy large crowds, and views of rocky mountainous shores dotted with pine trees and goats that suggest he had access to works by Roelandt Savery who had settled permanently in Utrecht by 1619

21946-4lastsu.jpg	After Ludovico il Moro was made duke of Milan in 1494, he decided to make the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie his family's burial place. This is the context within which Leonardo was probably commissioned to decorate the monks' dining room, the refectory, with a depiction of the Last Supper. It cannot be determined exactly when the commission went to Leonardo, however, the completion of the painting in 1498 is documented.Leonardo's Last Supper is indisputably one of the most famous and important works in the history of painting. The quality of the wall painting was recognized within a very short space of time after its completion; copies were produced of it and its praises were sung in contemporary sources. After conquering Milan in 1499, the French king is even said to have expressed the desire to bring it to France, but his advisors were apparently able to dissuade him on the grounds that, given the technological conditions of the time, transporting the painting would have been tantamount to destroying it.As in all his major undertakings, Leonardo sought a new technical solution for the process of painting. He decided in favour of mixed media and painted over two ground layers using oil and tempera paints, as was done in panel painting. This particular technique is partially responsible for the fact that the disintegration of the work set in so early, given the unfavourable climatic conditions.Scarcely 20 years after the completion of the work, it was already starting to come to pieces, possibly because the wall had absorbed water. Ever since, every generation has worried and made efforts to a greater or lesser degree to preserve this work. In 1943, during an air raid, a bomb exploded in the refectory of the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie and destroyed the roof and the wall to the right of the Last Supper right down to the foundations; the work of art, protected by sand bags, fortunately survived this catastrophe largely unscathed. Since about 1980, extremely extensive and technologically lavish restoration work has been taking place to preserve it, made particularly necessary by increasingly destructive air pollution. This restoration followed the disputed decision to remove all overpaintings and completions of missing sections, preserving only those parts originally painted by Leonardo.

18221-0402grec.jpg	Commenced in the summer of 1577, and completed in the spring of 1579, for the High Altar of the Sacristy of the Cathedral, where it still hangs. A document of 2nd July 1577 referring to this painting is the earliest record of El Greco in Spain. El Greco has produced one of the most dignified and moving portrayals of Christ in art. The powerful effect of the painting especially depends upon his original and forceful use of colour. Something of the effect of the grand images of the Saviour in Byzantine art is recalled. The motif of the crowding round Christ suggests an acquaintance with the works of the Northern artist, Bosch; the figure preparing the Cross could be derived from the similar figure bending forward in Raphael's tapestry cartoon of the Miraculous Draught of Fishes. This is, however, the last time that there are any hints of specific borrowings.The painting shows Christ clad in a bright red robe and looking up to Heaven with an expression of serenity as he is being tormented by his captors. A figure in the background bearing a red hat points at Christ accusingly, while two others argue over his garments. A man in green to Christ's left holds him firmly with a rope and is about to rip off his robe in preparation for his crucifixion. At the lower right, a man in yellow bends over the cross and drills a hole to facilitate the insertion of a nail to be driven through Christ's feet. The clouds above Christ, painted in strong diagonals, provide a 'path' of uplifting communication between Christ and God the Father. On the left side of the composition, the three Marys contemplate the event with distress. Above them a soldier wearing a suit of armour reminiscent of those fabricated in sixteenth-century Toledo stares out directly at the viewer. El Greco may have intended this figure to be a contemporary portrait.A small, signed version of the Espolio, at Upton Park, Warwickshire, the original preliminary model is probably for the large painting. Many other versions exist, but few can be by El Greco. The only occasion that he treated the subject was for the Cathedral, but the type of Christ created in the Espolio is taken up in the related subject of Christ carrying the Cross, and in other representations of Christ.The initial reception of the painting, when seen by the artists brought to value it, was that it was beyond appraisal. After the artist's death, the first real recognition of the painting was some two centuries later when Goya painted his Taking of Christ for the same sacristy

07166-canal207.jpg	The magnificent Baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute, designed by Baldassare Longhena, dominates the scene at the right. To the left of centre, in the middle distance, can be seen the Doge's Palace, and further over the Campanile of San Marco.Canaletto was to return to paint this view on a number of occasions, and it is instructive to compare this, his first interpretation of it, with a later treatment (in the Royal Collection, Windsor). In this picture the agitated brushwork effectively evokes a stormy sky and blustery breeze. By contrast, in the later painting the scene is one of far greater serenity, with no sails billowing in the wind, and all the architectural details clearly described. The comparison illustrates more than simply a shift in style, however; it suggests Canaletto found a challenge in reworking a familiar subject, so creating a quite different experience for the viewer

It was painted in Bruges and was commissioned to the artist by Tommaso Portinari, an agent of the Medicean bank who resided in the city with his family The painting was intended for the high altar of Sant' Egidio, the church of the Arcispedale of Santa Maria Nuova founded in 1288 by the banker's ancestor Folco Portinari. Shipped from Bruges by sea, with the financial aid of the banker Niccol&#242; di Giovanni Capponi, it arrived in Pisa by way of Sicily. The painting was then transported along the Arno and finally completed its tortuous journey at the Porta San Frediano in Florence on 28 May 1483. From here it was carried to its destination by sixteen strong porters under the surveillance of Meo di Tingo, an envoy of the Arcispedale. In 1567 the triptych was dismembered.When the work arrived in Florence, it immediately caused a sensation among the people and attracted a considerable following among contemporary artists. The triptych had an enormous impact, noticeably influencing the art of manuscript illustration in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries as well as illustrious representatives of Umbrian painting like Luca Signorelli

23774-goldweig.jpg	From about the mid-1660s onward, De Man painted stylish genre scenes that incorporate ideas adopted from works by De Hooch, Vermeer, and their contemporaries. The Man Weighing Gold is one of de Man's best-known and most beautiful genre paintings. In a comfortable interior, a gentleman weighs gold at a table watched by a seated woman, perhaps his wife. The artist cleverly suggests the chill of early morning by the thick garments worn by the pair, the woman's pose, the crumpled bedding beside the box bed, and the presence of a young servant placing peat in the hearth to ignite a fire. The perspective system is constructed upon an oblique, dual-point system. This complex system was common in paintings of church interiors, particularly in Delft, and de Man was undoubtedly familiar with it from his own, earlier renditions of such spaces. The conspicuous floor tiles and beamed ceiling intensify the illusionistic effects of the perspective as does the richly carved wainscoting and mantelpiece

09612-scodella.jpg	This is Correggio's penultimate great altarpiece, painted for the church of San Sepolcro. The frame was made by Marcantonio Zucchi to Correggio's own design.The flight of angels, clinging to the clouds, which so closely resembles the solutions adopted in the dome of the Cathedral of Parma and in The Night, is contrasted by the harmonious and static connection between the diagonal poses of the figures, creating a continuity that is reminiscent of the Madonna with Saint Jerome. The influence of Leonardo can be seen in the smile and attitude of the Virgin, and that of Raphael in the brilliant tints of the violets, the whites, and the orange-yellows

31262-venus_ma.jpg	Despite the different datings they have been given the two panels (Death of Procris, and Venus and Mars) may have formed part of a cycle illustrating themes from ancient mythology. The long shape of the panels suggest that they may have decorated a cassone chest.Another aspect of Piero's artistic personality is his ability to infuse his subjects with wit and fantasy.  The subject matter is sensual in nature, with Cupid nestling beside Venus' breast near a long-eared rabbit, a symbol of sexual excess. The black and white birds down below seem to symbolize the lovers, Venus and an exhausted Mars asleep on the ground.This panel may have been painted as part of a suite of marital furniture, such as a bedstead, hope chest, or frieze.

That this technique might be used to depict moment-by-moment developments within a particular episode is vividly illustrated by Scene 6, which also happens to incorporate a real window in the picture composition. A priest has just finished preparing his Easter dinner. We see him taking it out of the oven in the background. Suddenly Christ appears to him in a vision - he gestures to him from a medallion above the window - urging him to share his dinner with the hermit Benedict. In the foreground to the right the priest recoils from the vision, shading his eyes with his hand.

08887-crucifix.jpg	This large Crucifixion fresco is located on the east wall of the south transept. Its grand pathos surpasses anything of its time. In its overall structure and in several motivic details, it reveals points of contact with the slightly older reliefs of the Crucifixion by Nicola Pisano. The powerful form and dynamic posture of the crucified Christ towers over the groups of mourning and watching figures; they keep some distance from the cross thus leave sufficient room for the particularly expressive gestures of the figures closest to the cross

17977-01scene.jpg	"The first scene shows three events from the saint's life: on the left the Birth of St Francis, in the centre the Prophecy of the Birth by a Pilgrim and on the right the Homage of the Simple Man. A wall of houses towering up in the centre separates the Birth of St Francis from the other two simultaneous scenes. The first takes place inside a building and is determined by the contrasting appearance of the kneeling, sitting and stooping women who are surrounding the child together with an ox and ass. On the left edge of the picture a woman in a red dress is supporting the saint's mother. The circular arrangement on the right conveys an intimacy from which the other two women almost seem to be excluded. The vertical and diagonal compositional lines, which are created by the arrangement of the figures and the architecture of the space, meet in the figure of the holy child, which thereby becomes the centre of the composition.By means of disparities between the spatial and figural scale in the two following scenes, Benozzo creates differing levels of time. Francis' mother is standing at the top of a flight of steps. with her raised hands she is turning away the holy man who is identified as a pilgrim by his staff and bag. This meeting - chronologically the earliest event - is emphasized by the lines of the sloping roof and floor tiles, which converge compositionally at the mother's raised hands. It would be difficult to understand this scene if it were not for the explanatory inscription beneath: QUALITER B. F. FUIT DENU(N)TIATUS A XRO I(N) FORMA PEREGRINI QUOD DEBEBAT NASCI SICUT IPS(E) IN STAB(U)LO QUALIT(ER) QUIDA(M) FATUU(S) P(RO)STE(R)NEBAT B. F. VESTIME(N)TU(M) IN VIA - ""How St. Francis was announced by Christ in the form of a pilgrim, and that he, like Christ himself, had to be born in a stable. And how a certain simple man spread his clothes out where St Francis was walking."" It is Christ himself, therefore, who is heralding the birth of St Francis in the form of a pilgrim.On the right an event from the saint's youth has been added. The young Francis is walking along the street accompanied by a boy. Though further in the background than the two figures on the steps, the two figures are depicted proportionally larger. In the foreground of the picture on the right, a poorly clad man is kneeling, looking up to the small window in the palazzo. He is laying his cloak at the feet of Francis. The direction in which the beggar is looking and the right hand that the saint has raised to fend him off indicate the real reason for the homage: it is not directed at the smartly dressed, youthful Francis, but the new-born child, who like Christ was born in sparse surroundings. In official descriptions of his life, the birth of Francis is not mentioned. Only the ""Vita e Fioretti"", a legend dating from the 14th century which was not included in the official canon of legends about St Francis, describes his birth in a stable. For that reason, this rarely depicted scene is also missing from the cycle of St Francis in Assisi.The ox and ass, as well as the Prophecy of the Birth by the holy man, are motifs which create direct links with the birth of Christ and the annunciation to Mary. Even at the beginning of the cycle, analogies are already being created between Christ and Francis. With the deviation from the chronological sequence of events in the picture, Gozzoli is achieving a heightening of the tension within the picture"

25044-2flowers.jpg	On a broad shelf, whose colour is almost indistinguishable from that of the back wall of a room lit from a light source in the top left-hand corner, a display of objects is elegantly laid out: a majolica vase of flowers, a basket of fruit, some fruit and vegetables scattered about and two lizards, one of them green. This painting is the pendant to another (Galleria Borghese, Rome) whose subject is a multi-level display of dead birds. The two were listed in the 1607 inventory of the works sequestered from Cavaliere d'Arpino's studio. At one time it was suggested that these two paintings as well as A Table Laden with Flowers and Fruit marked Caravaggio's d�but in the field of still-life painting. Few scholars maintain this theory today, but more recent proposals attributing the Borghese paintings to Tommaso Salini, Francesco Zucchi or Frans Snyders have not fared any better.Doubt has rightly been cast on the homogeneity of the Master of the Hartford Still-life group, and the resulting confusion has prevented agreement on the dating of the paintings. When they were attributed to Caravaggio it was assumed that they were painted about 1593, soon after the artist's arrival in Rome. The likelihood that the Borghese pendants are by another painter, albeit one close to Cavaliere d'Arpino, from whose studio they definitely come, makes it possible to hypothesise a date any time before the fateful year 1607. The execution of the individual elements, such as the onion, Savoy cabbage, cardoon, apple and pear, demonstrates the artist's direct observation of nature, but the episodic spatial arrangement of the painting makes it almost impossible to imagine that it could have been painted by Caravaggio, who at this same date was painting Boy with a Basket of Fruit. The imaginary ambience, which embraces the subjects in Caravaggio's early works, is here a mere background.The impressive size of the two Borghese canvases suggests that they may have been painted for a particular client with a specific location in mind

04612-furtrade.jpg	Bingham was a specialist in subjects drawn from the American countryside, particularly life on the frontier. In this masterpiece of American genre painting, a unique document of river life in the Midwest, he has depicted a moment in the life of a French-Canadian fur trader, one of the voyageurs who combined commerce with exploration and adopted many ways of the wild. Bingham has raised anecdote to the level of poetic drama by setting up a tension between the suspicious stare of the old trader, the unconcerned reverie of his sprawling half Indian son, and the compact, enigmatic silhouette of a tethered bear cub. Parallel planes recede into the distant background, suggesting that Bingham was familiar with engravings of European paintings, yet the strict formality is softened by an exquisite luminosity

21149-schmadri.jpg	"In a letter  written in 1797, the artist stated: ""My genre is landscape painting, historic or poetic landscape.""In this painting we see a view out of the Lauterbrunnental to the Schmadribach falls in the Bernese  Oberland. This brings us closer to Koch's idea of the ""poetic"" landscape, and to ""heroic"" landscape as well. By poetic he meant the combination and compression of several elements that are never experienced together in nature. Here, in this powerful depiction of the mountains, the view is directed both downwards and upwards at once. Peaks that in reality conceal each other now tower one behind the other, all in view. This makes the Alps look as monumental as a range in the Himalayas. But at the same time details in the foreground are clearly visible.In all of Koch's paintings, nature retained its inviolable, indestructible grandeur and dignity.

18241-0602grec.jpg	This is probably the earliest extant portrait which El Greco painted in Toledo. The treatment, with the greater continuity of brushstroke, is related to that of his portrait of Vincenzo Anastagi of his last years in Italy, and to his first paintings in Spain. In the manner of Titian, the lynx fur is freely and vigorously painted. The dark tafts have been cleverly arranged so that they seem to splay out from the sitter, thereby enhancing and vivifying her. The identity of the sitter is not known, but clearly the portrait is too informal and intimate for a sitter of royal or aristocratic blood. The fact that El Greco painted very few female portraits, the intimate quality of the portrait, the apparent age of the sitter, and the correspondence in time with the setting up of the household, lead some critics to the conclusion that this is a portrait of Jer�nima de las Cuevas, his life-long companion in Spain, and the mother of his son, Jorge Manuel. Since evidence for Jer�nima's appearance is completely lacking there have been more reasoned proposals on the basis of comparison with other portraits. However, these identifications present problems of their own.Regarding the authorship of the painting, several other attributions have been put forward. It has been proposed as a work of Tintoretto, of an artist in the circle of the court painter Alonso S�nchez Coello, and most recently, of the Cremonese portrait painter Sofonisba Anguissola. None of these is any more convincing, however, than the traditional attribution.C�zanne's copy of the painting (1879-80; Pellerin collection, Paris) heralded the ultimate recognition of the artist

07279-canal808.jpg	If the attention of Rosalba Carriera and Pietro Longhi was drawn to the life and customs of their own day, Canaletto left for posterity a panorama of the colourfully spectacular public life of Venice, all registered in his precisely drawn and perspectively accurate scenes. He soon turned his back on the confident virtuoso displays of scenery painting and designing which he had been given a start in by his father Bernardo. And after a period in Rome where he was struck more by the objective reporting of reality by Viviano Coduzzi and painters from the Netherlands like Berkheyde than the decorative vivacity of Pannini and Van Wittel, Canaletto applied himself to setting onto canvas scenes from Venice as later he was to paint views of London and the English countryside. In these paintings he conceded nothing to the episodic and the picturesque and concentrated his clearsighted vision instead on creating a space-light synthesis of extraordinary truthfulness.The Perspective - donated by Canaletto to the Accademia in 1765 for his admission in the capacity of a painter of perspective in September, 1763 - is a fine example of his extraordinary recreation of real data in prodigiously stylized form.

44289-rome.jpg	Approximately half of Van Wittel's Roman vedute are views either of or along the Tiber. Made at fifteen different locations, most of them were repeated at least twice, as in this case. The present view represents the southernmost point Van Wittel ever painted along the Tiber. It was taken looking towards the north from the eastern bank, opposite the Porta Portese. To the left, across the river, we can see the quay known as the Porto di Ripa Grande, with the two long stairways and the customs building, behind which the small tower of Santa Maria della Torre is just visible. Further along the same bank of the Tiber, right before the river bend, lies the Palazzina Pamphilj and its garden, obscuring the Ponte Rotto. Most of the complex was demolished in the late nineteenth century to make way for the Ospizio di San Michele, except for the customs building, which was razed in 1914&#151;15.The tall tower on the horizon in the middle of the composition stands on the Capitoline; to its right are the Torre delle Milizie, the dome of Santi Luca e Martina, the Quirinal and the campanile of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. On the right riverbank near the Via della Marmorata, marked by a few blocks of marble, is an array of houses of various shapes and sizes, gardens and places of work. Lying in the Tiber below, there are the remains of a bridge that has long since collapsed and, further in the distance, those of the old Ponte Sublicio. There is almost no traffic on the river. A galley and two two-masters are moored at the Porto di Ripa Grande, while some rowboats, a large, flat-bottomed barge and an impressive rowing-sloop can be noticed. Among the figures strolling on the right a few monks can be distinguished as well as a gentleman who looks rather Dutch.This painting is a good example of Van Wittel's ability to group all the various elements of a sweeping panorama into one harmonious and well-ordered whole. A recurrent feature in his panoramas is the plateau in the foreground or a section of a wall or a cliff, enlivened by a small group of figures. One of them, in this case the man with the oar, serves to lead the spectator's eye into the composition. Van Wittel's vantage-point is generally rather high, according to the traditional Dutch formula he had learned from his teacher Withoos. In the foreground the painter looks down &#151; in this case at the men in the rowboats &#151; and then his eye is drawn to the middle of the composition and finally into the background. The painter induces the viewer, through the guide with the oar, to revolve a quarter circle from left to right, to survey the entire panorama.Finally, Van Wittel's extraordinary ability to represent water, with its shifting, shimmering reflections and almost palpable wetness, should be mentioned. This effect, unequalled by any other painter, is especially characteristic of Van Wittel's works from the early years of the eighteenth century

04254-david.jpg	The painting has been identified as a youthful self-portrait of Bernini, dating to 1625 and connected to the painted self portrait now in the Borghese Gallery. The iconographic choice of self-portrayal in the guise of David is interesting: self-identification with the biblical hero is both a recurring motif in Bernini's art and a theme in the poetry and image-making of his great patron, Pope Urban VIII. The painting technique is dashing and fast, with strongly visible brushstrokes and luminous touches. The treatment of physiognomy seems idealized when compared to a drawing with analogous iconography, at Windsor.

41140-holy_fam.jpg	"This picture introduces us to a busy moment in the Holy Family's everyday life. It is evening, the time of the evening meal, and the bathing of the Infant. Underneath a thatched building without walls on the sides, the Virgin is seated on an ornate brocade mattress. At her head an angel is arranging her pillow, whereas on her right two shepherds watch humbly but inquisitively how the family arrangements are proceeding. The Virgin - quite unusually - is not in charge of the situation: although she would like to feed Jesus, He flees to Joseph, to escape dinner. He trails a diaper behind Him and looks back at His mother to see the effect of His action. Old Joseph, who looks like Santa Claus, with a white beard and dressed in red, is sitting at his work-bench. He is holding flowers in both hands to lure Jesus to him. There is a hustle and bustle in the whole scene. The dilapidated thatching is being repaired by two angels. Three other angels are singing beside a gorgeous golden fountain in the bottom left corner, while two more angels are carrying water from there to the bath-tub, which, to quote Panofsky, ""is enclosed by one of the earliest and most elegant shower-curtains in history"". Beside it a woman is also busy preparing the water for the bath.Some of the charming details which emanate a warm atmosphere have a symbolic meaning too. The motif of repairing the roof refers to the fact that the institution of the Church needs perpetual repair. The lovely golden fountain symbolizes the Fountain of Life in Paradise.It is not easy to be certain where the picture was created. It was certainly not made in a first-rate court workshop; neither the manner of the painting nor the character of the whole scene is refined enough for this. On the other hand, it is obvious that the painter had been touched by the elegance of the International Gothic style. This is evinced, for example, by the brocade mattress of the Virgin's bed, by the shower-curtain and the graceful movement of the figure scooping water. The naturalness of the stocky, popular figures, the lavish attention to small details illustrating the story (for example, the five toes of the angel standing in the bottom left corner, Joseph's work-bench, the ladder, the nails of the hut, etc.) are reminiscent of the art of the southern part of the Netherlands. On the other hand, here and there the definitely expressive manner of painting and the mood of the representation reflect the proximity of the North German provinces. Such elements are, e.g., the bare little tree sketched with quick white strokes of the brush into the foreground of the painting, or the animated scene in the background on the left side, where against a dark green ground the steep rocks and the figures of the two shepherds are depicted only with black outlines and white lines which zigzag like strokes of lightning.This scene shows the playful spirit of the early fifteenth century"

38484-johnbapt.jpg	The subject of the childhood, or rather the adolescence, of St John the Baptist was treated several times by the artist. The very iconography of the ascetic adolescent preaching penitence in the desert of Judea is particularly well adapted to the style of the artist, both tense and impassioned. Here, St John the Baptist is actually represented in his mission as a harbinger. He points towards the lamb, and gazes heavenwards. With his right hand, he holds the cross, symbol of his sacrifice. The opening onto the landscape on the right is also characteristic of this artist.The great expressive force of this painting, with its concern for a more immediate realism would seem to approach it to the St Jerome in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City

39404-5maryma.jpg	In the Sala Inferiore there are two paintings of a solitary woman in a twilit, well-wooded and -watered landscape. Traditionally, but unconvincingly, the women are identified as St Mary Magdalen and St Mary of Egypt, penitent hermits who have nothing to do with context of the decoration of the room. The woman is the same in both paintings sitting in two adjacent spots by the same stream and wearing the same clothes. In one painting she faces the observer virtually head-on and in the other almost completely turns her back on us. In one pose she lowers her gaze to her closed book and in the other raises her eyes from the now open book in rumination. In all likelihood this is a dual picture of Mary as the protagonist of the story of redemption.St Mary Magdalen is captured from the front, engrossed in reading, and given prominence like the large tree trunk on the left by a phosphorescent light falling on a magically mysterious nature. She is succinctly defined in the final fleeting instant before the night shadows fall on the outline of the rustic cottages, on the rolling plains, on the ridges of the hills and mountains.Like the landscape with the figure of St Mary of Egypt, this work too was influenced by northern models: it suggests the paintings and prints of the Danube School (for instance by Albrecht Altdorfer and Wolf Huber), and woodcuts by Hans Baldung Grien, the Nuremberg graphic artist Virgil Solis, and the mysterious artist, known only by his monogram of HWG, who depicts St John the Evangelist on Patmos, surrounded by a fantastic landscape

32279-07landsc.jpg	Poussin was the innovator of Classical landscape, although only about a dozen of his pictures of this type survive. Their stylistic source was the Aldobrandini Lunettes by Annibale Carracci, assisted by Domenichino and Lanfranco. Poussin abandoned many of the Italians' concessions to realism and retreated into a totally artificial world devoid of subtle light or atmosphere. The earliest of the truly Classical landscapes is probably the Landscape with a Man Killed by a Snake.In this picture a drama is taking place, but it is not immediately apparent. it was Poussin's aim to bring about this realization slowly in the spectator, through contemplation. A man lies dead in the foreground in the coils of a snake, and another man has come across the spectacle and is fleeing in terror. In the background a woman reacts to the terror of the man in flight, and in turn her reaction is noticed by a fisherman.. Poussin has depicted a series of emotions in this extensive panorama which is painted in dense blues, greens and browns. The gloom of the scene is intended to provoke the spectator to contemplate the triumph of nature over man.The painting probably was painted for one of Poussin's main patrons, Pointel

21566-balaam.jpg	The biblical story (Num. 22:1-35) represented here is the following. The arrival of the Israelites in the Jordan valley alarmed Balak, king of Moab, who sent for Balaam, a foreigner, to pronounce a curse on them. On his journey an angel, invisible to Balaam, barred the way, causing his ass to turn aside. This led to an altercation between the man and his beast in which the latter, like the animals of fable, acquired the gift of speech. Balaam's eyes were then opened and he saw the angel with a drawn sword. The conversion of Balaam by the vision of the angel was regarded as prefiguration of the appearance of Christ to the apostle Thomas.This subject is rarely depicted in paintings and prints of the sixteenth and seventeenth century. Also in post-Reformation illustrated bibles the subject is exceptional. However, Balaam played a significant role in Netherlandish processional and festival culture of the late Middle Ages and early modern period. Lastman's Balaam and the Ass from 1622 was important for Rembrandt, who studied with Lastman for six months in 1624/25. In his painting of the same subject made in 1626, Rembrandt was clearly influenced by the composition as well as by the lighting and the use of colour of his former teacher

23370-07loreto.jpg	This painting, the first work Lotto painted for the basilica of Loreto, is one of the several altarpieces that he executed in the Marches in the 1530s. It depicts an unusually dramatic group of saints, in which a colossal St Christopher dwarfs his two companions. The three represented saints have intimate connections with the cult of the Madonna of Loreto, one of whose principal roles was as a protector against the plague, and with the shrine of the Holy House as a goal for pilgrims in search of a miraculous cure from disease.There is a curious motif in the central foreground: a paper scroll, inscribed with an eye and the painter's signature (Laurentii Loti pictoris opus), wrapped round a snake. The snake is a symbol of evil, while the eye alludes to the all-seeing eye of God. In combination, the motif signifies the power of God over evil, and perhaps over the evil of plague, in particular. Thus the motif is connected with the curative and prophylactic powers of the represented saints

The painting portrays real and picturesque figures, all of whom English gentlemen who instead of being shown in a sumptuous representation, as in the case of Raphael's School of Athens, are very ill-mannered fellows. One is even lying on the ground, modelled after Raphael's Diogenes, and, naturally, there are dogs. This coterie includes other figures who are laughing and making faces.

11621-landford.jpg	"It seems certain that it was Monsignor Agucchi, the majordomo of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini, who brought the works of the young Bolognese painter, Domenichino, to the attention of his master, who had moved to Rome in 1602. Under the guidance of Annibale Carracci, Domenichino helped to establish the popularity of the classical and ideal landscape.The anecdotal content of the painting lends itself to a variety of interpretations. The attitudes of observation, action, and expectation adopted by the figures - represented from left to right by a single person, a couple, and a family group, and differentiated by colour into red, blue, and yellow appear to correspond to three different historical perspectives: past, present, and future. They are presented, respectively, as a woman musing over the way she has come, a man carrying his companion across the river, and a peasant with his wife and children who are removing their boots. Perhaps the picture is intended as an illustration of the proverb ""he who has crossed the ford, knows how deep the water is."" Yet the ending remains open to conjecture: will the man in the middle of the ford reach his goal and will the others, waiting on the bank, follow him? The significance of the picture can only be grasped if we bear in mind the high intellectual level Aldobrandini - Agucchi. The episodic composition, the smooth brush strokes, the sober and yet joyous palette, and the clear air might even seem ingenuous, but it is a refined naivete, more deliberate than natural"

42842-09buckin.jpg	In the last decade of his life Veronese painted a major cycle of religious pictures made up of ten oblong canvases of equal size inspired by stories from the Old and New Testament, known to scholars as the Duke of Buckingham series, after the name of the nobleman who owned them in the early seventeenth century. The canvases, now divided among the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, which has seven of them, the National Gallery in Washington (one) and the Narodni Galerie in Prague (two), were probably intended for a convent. They are the following: Lot and his Daughters Leaving Sodom, Hagar in the Wilderness, Rebecca at the Well, Susanna and the Elders, Esther and Ahasver, Adoration of the Shepherds, Christ and the Centurion, Christ and the Adulteress, Christ and the Woman of Samaria, and Christ Washing the Feet of the Disciples.The striking feature of the series, to which the canvas Christ Washing the Feet of the Disciples belongs, is the unusual monumentality of the figures, most of them located in the foreground

33581-122portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 118.Hendrickje Stoffels (1626-1663) was the daughter of an army sergeant. She advanced in Rembrandt's household from servant to mistress, presumed model, and common-law wife, as well as stepmother to the artist's son Titus (1641-1668) and mother of his daughter Cornelia (1654-1685).

13850-4element.jpg	Personifications of the Four Elements were conventionally depicted as four females distinguished only by their attributes. Louis Finson, however, used a different type of presentation; the elements as male and female, entangled in a fierce struggle. Fire (upper right) is depicted as a strong, young man surrounded by flames. He is in a firm grip with Water (lower left) and holding Air (upper left) down. Air, an almost floating woman, is literary pushed up in the air by water. She grabs fire by his hair and at the same time holding him back with her right leg. Water, a bearded, older but very strong man is seated with his knees up and surrounded by small waves. He tries to push the element of Earth away with his feet. Earth (lower right) is depicted as an older lady lying on her back and grabbing the chest of water. She is surrounded by brown earth and tries to grip Fire by his left leg, who carefully steps over her.The present painting, made in April 1611, dates from Finson's Neapolitan period and clearly shows the dominant influence of Caravaggio, although he has not entirely abandoned the etiolated figural style of Giuseppe Cesari, called Cavaliere D'Arpino, whose work was also to be found in quantity in Naples, and whose influence can be noted in other works from his Neapolitan period,The painting is signed and dated lower right: Lovs. Finsonsivs Fecit/ APRIL A^(o) 1611.

44080-04philip.jpg	The Duchy of Burgundy had its heyday under Philip the Bold, John the Fearless, Philip the Good and Charles the Bold. Between them, they acquired countless new territories, through a cunning combination of astute marriages, timely purchase and the barely legal diversion of other people's inheritances. Rogier van der Weyden received many commissions from the Court of Burgundy. He excelled in portrait. He was not a realist, he did not seek to capture the particular characteristic of his model, but instead tried to create an ideal image. This approach was very popular with his contemporaries, and brought him considerable success in this genre. He was sought after by the grandest aristocrats and prelates, as well as by the wealthy bourgeoisie, who wanted him to record and embellish their features for posterity.Several writers have drawn attention to Van der Weyden's treatment of his sitter's hands, which he almost always painted joined together, discreetly, so as not to distract from their faces, yet quietly present, always serving to underline their serenity.This painting is one of the several versions and copies of the portrait of Philip the Good executed by Rogier van der Weyden and his workshop

32061-cremona.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The Golgotha by Pordenone dominate the nave; an elevated Golgotha towers over the portal of the entrance. Pordenone places the cross at an angle in the picture plane, which moves Christ to the right of centre, making the composition more dynamic. The movement of the riders beneath the crosses echoes the crosses above them. A circular configuration results, and Mary has fallen into a faint at its centre.In the lower zone of the wall next to the portal to the church Pordenone painted the Lamentation in 1522. Not until 1529 did the Lamentation receive its pendant, when Bernardino Gatti painted the Resurrection on the other side of the portal

11146-1870s_11.jpg	Degas, free of the need to sell pictures in order to live, pursued his interest in people, their characters and temperaments, their faces and body language. He painted uncommissioned portraits or had his acquaintances present situations that conveyed typical behaviour. Crowds at racetracks and the lean, diminutive jockeys on their delicate, nervy horses supplied him with open-air motifs

17159-portra11.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 493, JH 1643.Van Gogh painted two portraits of the Roulin's seventeen-year-old son, Armand. Both were completed in November 1888 but neither on the size of canvas originally planned. One  shows a young man in profile, dressed in a dark blue suit and matching hat; the other, probably the first version, presents Armand Roulin full face, in a citrine jacket and contrasting hat and waistcoat of blue. Both paintings are very simple in their composition, presenting the young man without any additional details, decoration or scenery such as are provided in the portraits of the Roulin parents or in others where colour, setting or costume attempt to introduce layered meanings. What is remarkable in both these pictures is the seriousness of expression, which is almost sombre and sad. This effect of the features contrasts with Armand's almost dandyish dress, the rakish angle of his hat, and the carefully painted knotting of his cravat

14941-6pould11.jpg	In October 1889, Gauguin settled in Marie Henry's inn at Le Pouldu, an isolated village in Brittany. One after the other, he produced such works as The Yellow Christ, The Green Christ or The Calvary, La Belle Ang�le. These works showed that he was in full possession of his art, with an equally masterful control of vision, plastic form, and technique.Things sacred are present in the background of Gauguin's portraits, which he wanted to put in expressive harmony with the faces, according to the Symbolist doctrine which inspired also Van Gogh. Strange anguished faces are whirling around Meyer de Haan in Nirvana. Gauguin regarded things sacred as linked with a darkly virgin and barbaric power. The Idol was to bring him that which God no longer gave him.Gauguin placed the first of his idols, motionless and mysterious, near the Belle Ang�le. He no doubt was inspired by the Chimu pottery of the northwest coast of Peru and its stirrup portrait vases. A branch of Gauguin's family is Peruvian and there is definite evidence that he was familiar with Peruvian vases

In fact, the subject of the Martyrdom and Last Communion of St Lucy closely reflects two of the themes most earnestly propagated by Counter-Reformation religion: the glory of martyrdom for the true faith; and the salvation of the soul through the sacraments of the Catholic church.The painting shows St Lucy who, refusing to give up her Christian faith, was condemned to death during the persecutions of Emperor Diocletian at the beginning of the fourth century. In this case the work was not painted for display or devotion in a private house, but for the public surroundings of a church, where its religious message would have served to stimulate the piety of the faithful

44089-1hubert2.jpg	"In 1436 Rogier van der Weyden was appointed to the office of town painter of Brussels, the most important city in  the duchy of Brabant and one of the main residences of the Duke of Burgundy. Rogier's position is probably connected with his acceptance of the most important commission the city could give an artist, the huge Scenes of Justice for the town hall. (Unfortunately these were destroyed during the bombardment of Brussels by the French troops of Louis XIV in 1695.)This huge commission from the city must have demanded an enormous amount of working capacity on Rogier's part, and at the same time would have raised his reputation greatly. In Brussels, which appears to have had no artistic tradition of any significance before his arrival, he must soon have become a fashionable painter in great demand. For this large civic commission of course he needed assistants, who would also help to supply other demands. The regulations of the Brussels painters' guild allowed a master to have only one apprentice at a time, but placed no restriction on the number of journeymen he could employ. Rogier presumably employed more and more assistants to work on the pictures, though only a single original source refers to them: when an altarpiece was installed in Cambrai in 1459, several ""ouvriers"" (workmen, or more likely assistants) are mentioned.Among extant paintings, there are already works from around 1440 which closely resemble Rogier's artistically, but are different from paintings by his own hand, and so are probably by the employees of his workshop. At this point he would not have had time to train more than one apprentice to the point of being qualified to set up independently, so there can hardly have been any ""successors"" of Rogier yet. However, he could already have passed on his technique and style to a number of journeymen, who would then have been able both to assist him in working on the city's huge commission, and also to produce independent paintings of their own which could leave the workshop under the name of ""Rogier.""Two panels with scenes from the life of St. Hubert show that he did in fact employ several relatively independent assistants. These scenes are very much in Rogier's style, but diverge from his major works in both execution and layout. Both panels were originally in the chapel of St Hubert in St Gudule, the main church of Brussels. The chapel was donated in 1437 by two prosperous citizens, Jan Cools and Jan Vrientschap, who probably commissioned the paintings at the same time; the two paintings seem originally to have been part of a larger series, and may well have been ready for the dedication of the chapel in 1439. These two extant panels are clearly the work of different artists, and indeed it seems likely, judging by the various different ways of painting faces, that several painters may have worked on the Exhumation of St Hubert. The two pictures are considerably different from each other in design, a feature particularly obvious in the differences of spatial depiction; the Exhumation of St Hubert, which is executed to a very high standard, is more convincing in this respect, and does not show the exaggerated effect of depth that makes the room in the Dream of Pope Sergius look like a tunnel.The scene showing the exhumation of St Hubert in 825 from his tomb in St Peter's Church, Li�ge, has been transferred to the choir of a modern Gothic church of Rogier's time. Bishop Walcaud of Li�ge, planning to move the corpse to the Benedictine abbey of Andage, is swinging a censer in the foreground left; Emperor Louis the Pious (778-840) and Archbishop Adelward of Cologne are kneeling one each side of the altar. The onlookers, who wear contemporary clothing, probably include the two donors of the pictures, with their families.The men who worked in Rogier's workshop were obviously more than mere humble assistants in the execution of paintings; when the number of commissions on hand made it necessary, they even designed pictures with relative independence. In doing so they naturally used their master's formulae and his figure types. Rogier's assistants also resorted to models already in the workshop for such features as the pattern of textiles; the patterned green fabric of the altar cloth in the Exhumation of St Hubert had already featured in the under-dress of the young woman to the left in the Deposition (Prado, Madrid), and the pattern appears again a good deal later in the scene of the Annunciation on the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), on a carpet"

03318-portgent.jpg	"Earlier this picture was described as a work of Leonardo. Later, the panel was attributed to Holbein. Finally, of exceptionally high quality, the painting was given to Bartolomeo Veneto by comparing it to two other portraits by the same painter, now at Houston and Washington. The proposed dating is the second decade of the sixteenth century (perhaps 1512), in the wake of Bartolomeo's sojourn in Ferrara between 1506 and 1508.Bartolomeo Veneto (Bartolommeo Veneziano) attracted attention at the end of the 19th century. He was a pupil of Gentile Bellini, he worked at the Court of the Grand Duke of Ferrara and elsewhere. There he came under the influence of Lombard artists.The artist enriched his original Venetian pictorial language with direct exposure to the influence of Albrecht D�rer, who had been active in Venice in the first years of the sixteenth century. The figures of the knight and the soldier, visible in the background, are literally copied from a 1496 woodcut by D�rer. The identity of the sitter, however, remains a mystery. We do know, however, that he must have been a gentleman attached to the Mantuan court of the Gonzagas.Recently, it was suggested that Bartolomeo Veneto may have been the talented portraitist working in Raphael's workshop who was responsible for the faces of the chair-bearers in the Vatican Palace's Mass of Bolsena.Several inscriptions are legible in the painting: on the medal of the sitter's beret is written ""Probasti e Chognovisti""; on the placard above the animal on the medal are the Greek letters epsilon and tau; and along the edge of the plaquette that decorates the sword handle, ""IN(?) B:VF"" and ""NO SPI(E)"""

42293-0711vela.jpg	"""He was tall in stature, thin, choleric, splenetic, with a red face, bald in front with thick eyebrows bent above the nose [...], that revealed his severity and harshness..."". These were the words used by Giacinto Gigli in 1655 to describe the pope (Giovanni Battista Pamphilj [1574-1655], made a cardinal in 1629 and elected to the throne on September 16, 1644), adding that ""his face was the most deformed ever born among men."" Justi and later Morelli considered his head ""the most repugnant... of all the Fisherman's successors"" and ""insignificant, indeed vulgar,"" with an expression similar to ""that of a cunning lawyer."" And yet this ugly and sullen man was paradoxically the subject of one of the most admired portraits of the seventeenth century, and perhaps of all time.Pope Innocent, aged seventy-five at the time, was a man of remarkable vigour, with a great capacity for work and a hot and violent temper. In the painting he wears the white liturgical under-vestment known as an alb, a biretta, and a red cape to which subdued highlights lend a sheen suggesting the texture of fabric. The Pope is seated in a red armchair, which is picked out from the opulent red of the curtain behind it by its gilded ornamentation. In the strong, almost rustic features of the Pope's reddened face with its fleshy cheeks, the critically keen suspicious eyes strike a note of lively intelligence. The fascinating nature of a man aware of his own power is wonderfully expressed in the contrast between the face and the fine nervous hands, which convey the sensitivity of this powerful figure. Mention has often been made of the chromatic unity of this portrait, in which the red flesh tones, the red cape, the red camauro, and the armchair of red velvet against the backdrop of a red door create such a dramatic effect that, if the pope were to open his mouth, even his saliva would be blood red. This marvelously orchestrated profusion of crimson tints - sometimes, as in the cape, with cold reflections as if ""lit by neon"" - undoubtedly derives from the example of Titian, while the representation of the contrasting white gown certainly harks back to Veronese, the only sixteenth-century Venetian painter who knew how to handle this difficult ""non-colour."" A man of power, bolt upright, depicted in magenta, an aggressive and vital colour, that together with white symbolizes creation.The portrait of Pope Innocent X is by common consent one of the world's supreme masterpieces of portraiture, unsurpassed in its breathtaking handling of paint. Apparently the Pope was not at first very enthusiastic about his portrait, describing it as troppo vero, ""too real"". However, we are told that it eventually won his approval, and he presented the Spanish painter with a very valuable gold chain. Vel�zquez himself must presumably have been very pleased with the portrait, or he would not have taken a replica back to Spain with him. His art colleagues certainly praised it, and many copies of the work were made.With this portrait Vel�zquez joins the ranks of those painters who, from the Renaissance onwards, produced magnificent papal likenesses. Outstanding examples, which he must have known, were Raphael's portraits of Pope Julius II (c. 1511/12; London, National Gallery), and Pope Leo X with two cardinals (1518/19; Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi), and several pictures by Titian of Pope Paul III, still extant in Naples"

07601-59jerome.jpg	This picture of the holy scholar was made for Ippolito Malaspina, a Maltese knight whose coat of arms is on the wooden panel to the right. He was connected by marriage to Caravaggio's patron Ottavio Costa and was a confidant of the Grand Master, who may have been used as the model for the saint (similarly Van Dyck was to use the sister of the Queen of England as model for the Madonna). The saint does indeed look like the knight in a recently discovered portrait by Caravaggio, who has been identified by some as Wignacourt himself.The composition is planned in terms of triangles. One rises from the table to the saint's head, another has its apex at the cardinal's hat on the wall to the left, a third recedes to the bedstead at the back on the right. This simple design helps convey an idea of simplicity. St Jerome has no halo, his workbench is rudimentary, he does not own any folios, he has one candle to see by, a crucifix to meditate on, a stone to beat against his chest, and a skull to remind him of his mortality. He is partly naked because he lives an eremitical life in the desert of Judaea. A steady light shines on his torso and picks out the red cloak round his legs. The source of the light is outside the picture, and can be interpreted as Christ, Light of the World

28498-early07.jpg	Encouraged by some success in the 1865 Salon and spurred on by Manet's Le D�jeuner sur l'herbe, which appeared two years earlier, Monet began work on a huge canvas measuring approximately 4,5 m x 6 m. He worked on it in his studio with the aid of individual studies which had been done in the open. In 1866, he abandoned this ambitious work and left the painting unfinished.Having been forced to leave the canvas with a creditor as security, he was not able to redeem it until 1884. In the meantime, the painting had unfortunately been damaged. Consequently, Monet cut the composition up in three sections, only the left-hand and middle sections have been preserved. A study carried out in September 1865 (now in the Pushkin Museum, Moscow) gives an impression of the full-scale painting which contained no fewer than 12 life-size figures

15818-horses1.jpg	The present painting depicts a dark bay and a grey horse in a fenced paddock by a wood. It repeats a motif to which Gilpin returned frequently throughout his career: the portrayal of two animals head-to-head in a parkland setting. It also includes the large dock-leaves in the foreground which appear in innumerable pictures, a habit he shared with Stubbs

07777-70arriva.jpg	"Canvas No. 7 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".In the scene of the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne some details of the event are relegated to marginal positions. While in the distance some of the vessels of the retinue are still out at sea, to the left the flagship has already docked; Ursula and Pope Cyriacus lean out to ask information from a boatman. To the right, in the foreground, four armed envoys have just finished reading out the message warning the Hun princes of the arrival of the Christian pilgrims. Carpaccio does not really demonstrate great self-assuredness in the composition of the scene or in the way the individual events are related to one another. But we can already begin to make out the characteristic features of his visual language: the slow, almost magically suspended rhythm of the narration, fixed in its most salient moment; the attention to the lighting of even the smallest details; the extraordinary brightness of the colours.The event is portrayed in a fresh and lively scene of movement. At the top, the vessel's pennant and the mast are cut off abruptly, while to the left there is the suggestion of a vast expanse of water and to the right the urban density of Cologne. The setting is reminiscent of a misty autumn morning in Venice. In the greyish light the ships glide slowly over the still water, reaching the harbour just outside the city walls depicted in perspective towards a vanishing point on the horizon: this whole part of the scene looks very much like the older sections of the Arsenal in Venice"
