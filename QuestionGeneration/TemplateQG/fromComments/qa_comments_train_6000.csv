32050-croesus.jpg	The subject is taken from the Greek author Herodotus. Croesus, king of Lydia, whose riches were proverbial, was said to have been visited by Solon (638-558 BC) the Athenian sage. The words of Solon - that the humble, when blessed with good fortune, were happier than Croesus with all his wealth - earned the king's displeasure. Later the Persian king Cyrus conquered Lydia and built a pyre for his vanquished foe. About to be burned alive, Croesus remembered the wisdom of Solon and thrice called out his name, which so roused the curiosity of Cyrus that he spared his victim's life.Willem de Poorter's painting illustrates the conversation between Croesus and Solon. Between the king and sage, a third man can be seen straining his neck to glimpse the splendour on display. A variety of vessels and urns, all elaborately embellished and shining with gold, lie scattered on the floor and on a table covered in dark red velvet

42264-0508vela.jpg	Philip IV succeeded his father, Philip III of Spain, in 1621, and, for the first 22 years of his reign, Philip's valido, or chief minister, was the Conde-Duque de Olivares, who took the spread of the Thirty Years' War as an opportunity not only for resuming hostilities against the Dutch at the end of the Twelve Years' Truce of 1609 (1621) but also for an ambitious attempt to restore Spanish hegemony in Europe, in close alliance with the imperial branch of the Habsburg dynasty.Vel�zquez' most impressive equestrian portrait, painted in 1634, did not depict any member of the royal family but took as its subject Count-Duke of Olivares on Horseback. At that point in time, Olivares, by now the most powerful man in the kingdom, sometimes even more powerful than the king, could describe himself by the title of Count-Duke. He expressed his sense of his own dignity by having himself painted on horseback, an honour usually accorded only to ruling heads of state, and Vel�zquez constructed a Baroque equestrian portrait of extremely bold composition.Olivares, famous for his horsemanship, is shown as a field-marshal with a plumed hat, a cuirass adorned with gold and a baton; seated on his mount, he is leaping down from a height into the depths below, and his figure fills the entire breadth of the canvas. The viewer looks diagonally upwards at the horseman, whose head is turned well to one side, so that he himself is looking down on the viewer from above in a lordly manner. The magnificent chestnut horse has its head turned the other way and is looking down into the depths of the picture, where the smoke of fires and gunpowder rises on a wide plain, and the turmoil of battle is show raging in miniature. Despite theories that have often been put forward, this picture does not necessarily show any particular battle; instead, it alludes in general to the military skill of the man who led the king's armies from triumph to triumph.The bottom left corner of the picture shows an unfolded empty sheet of white paper. Curiously, although he usually failed to sign and date his paintings, Vel�zquez often added such blank pieces of paper to his pictures but wrote nothing on them

10912-cambyse2.jpg	David's first paintings probably date from the years between 1480 and 1484. They reflect a Dutch influence in his early training. Soon after he arrived in Bruges, however, in 1487 and 1488, the municipal authorities requested him to paint a series of panels for the deputy burgomaster's room in the town hall. This major commission took the form of a large diptych that was first mentioned in the city archives as a Last Judgment, but which in fact depicts The Judgment of Cambyses. The subject is taken from Herodotus: the judge Sisamnes, who had been guilty of prevarication, was arrested and punished by Cambyses, the King of Persia. For his crimes, Sisamnes was condemned to be flayed alive. David represents this scene with a cold and exemplary cruelty. Like the paintings Dieric Bouts made for the town hall in Louvain, David's panels were intended as a stern warning to judges against the temptation of corruption.The right panel depicts: The Flaying of Sisammes

00798-perugia2.jpg	St Dominic and St Nicholas of Bari stand to the Virgin's right. They lack the sculptural monumentality of the saints in the Linaiuoli altarpiece, are lit in a softer and more diffuse manner, and are not made to stand in a darkened niche. Here, for the first time Angelico breaks away from the convention of the abstract, all-surrounding gold, and places the figures in front of a long table, whose end can be seen behind St Nicholas of Bari who has placed his mitre on it. This is not, however, so great a departure from convention as might be implied, as the table is covered with a golden cloth and beyond it is the usual gold background.The two figures stand at the very front of the space created, St Dominic's foot and St Nicholas's vestments touching the edge of the step. St Nicholas wears his bishop's cope and supports his crook, while at his feet are three full leather bags. These refer to the most popular legend concerning this fourth-century churchman. He reputedly tossed bags of gold through the open window of a house, providing the three women who lived within with dowries and thus saving them from turning to prostitution. The event is shown, with two other scenes from the saint's life, in one of the predella panels from the altarpiece

22341-1girl.jpg	This is a characteristic early painting of the artist from his Leiden period. It is certainly not a portrait. Some experts assumed that it is a fragment of a larger composition, perhaps Mary from an Annunciation, but it is not convincing. The painting is probably a tronie of a young girl. (Tronies are representations of particular character types, such as soldiers, orientals, old men or young women.)

38979-01labia.jpg	The decoration of the ballroom covers the entire wall surface. The faux perspectival architecture laid out by Mengozzi-Colonna  prior to Tiepolo's involvement is particularly effective; in keeping with a frequently repeated scheme, it illusionistically expands the relatively modest-sized cubic room, making it appear much vaster and creating a fictitious space that seems to extend infinitely

29700-bathsheb.jpg	The subject of this painting is a rare one, and is often confused with the story of Esther and Ahasuerus. King David is old and weak when Bathsheba visits him. Bathsheba reminds him that he promised that her son Solomon would be king after him. This is a sensitive matter, as David's son Adonijah has already made himself king - without telling his father. David listens to her and orders that Solomon is to be anointed king over Israel.For Jan van Noordt the source of inspiration was certainly the 1646 painting of the same subject by Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, now in Prague.The painting is on long-term loan to the Sz�pm�v�szeti M�zeum, Budapest from a private collection

14826-circumci.jpg	In its use of strong colours and miniaturist detail, the work is typical of the Ferrarese High Renaissance. The panel is thought to have formed the central section of the predella for Garofalo's altarpiece of the Massacre of the Innocents painted in August 1519 for the church of San Francesco in Ferrara and now in the city's Pinacoteca Nazionale. As early as 1632 the Louvre picture is known to have been removed from the Ferrara altarpiece and substituted by a copy.

23724-kensingt.jpg	Whistler's followers included Theodore Roussel, Paul Maitland, Walter Richard Sickert and the young Wilson Steer - that is, the artists widely considered the leading British Impressionists. With Sidney Starr they split off from the New English Art Club. This sub-group used the label London Impressionists. The driving force was Sickert who outlined the task facing British Impressionism: to record the magic and poesy that lay all around in everyday life. London, the great metropolis, provided all the stimulating subject-matter that was necessary.The concentration on London subject-matter was apparent in the work of Sickert, Starr, Roussel and the latter's pupil Maitland. Urban problems resulting from 19th-century expansion in the cities - such as unemployment, poverty, child labour, alcoholism and prostitution -  were almost totally absent from this art. The city was being viewed as a predominantly middle-class thing

32126-cattle.jpg	The atmosphere in this small painting appears almost threatening. The dramatic formation of white and dark gray clouds contrasts with a few patches of blue, and it is uncertain whether a storm is building or the sky is about to clear up. Seen from below and positioned against the brightest portion of the sky, the young bull and the black cow in the foreground become monumental, commanding presences. In the background the lighting is reversed, Here, the peacefully resting and grazing animals, bathed in sunlight, are surrounded by windswept trees and silhouetted against the menacing dark clouds.Cows have traditionally been associated with the earth, fecundity, prosperity and spring - associations that in the context of seventeenth-century Netherlands can be linked to the importance of dairy farming to the Dutch economy. Dairy farming was at its most successful toward the middle of the century, and during this time cows became popular pictorial subjects.The painting is signed and dated lower left: Paulus.

32793-29christ.jpg	Leonardo's influence is particularly strong in the Blessing Christ in Brescia. Here Christ is shown emerging from the tomb. He is no longer an object of compassion, as in 14th and 15th century panels. Rather, he is depicted as the Resurrected Christ; he still bears the symbols of the Passion, the crown of thorns and the marks of the nails which bound his hands and feet to the Cross. Every element of the artist's experience with Perugino has by now been abandoned. The figure displays a smoothness of surface and a soft chiaroscuro modelling which clearly surpass the abilities of Raphael's master

The theme of this representation is the appearance of the angel, who saves the completely exhausted Hagar, leaning against an empty barrel in the desert, and her son from dying of thirst, and who prophecies that Ishmael shall be made the ""father of many nations"". With an energetic gesture he points out the way, which, in reference to the central ceiling painting The Sacrifice of Isaac, leads away from the divine light.

03770-037prese.jpg	A direct comparison between two artists is made startlingly clear by the two Presentations at the Temple, executed by Giovanni Bellini and by Andrea Mantegna. The two paintings, now housed respectively at the Galleria Querini Stampalia in Venice and the Staatliche Museen in Berlin, have an identical structure and the same characters: in the foreground, leaning against a marble ledge, the Virgin is holding the swaddled Child while the old priest stretches out to take it. At sides and in the centre are several characters identified as Jacopo Bellini (the old man in the middle) and as Nicolosia and Andrea Mantegna, possibly recently married (the young couple standing at the sides facing left). In the painting by Bellini there are two more figures, identified by critics as the mother Anna and Giovanni himself. The invention was probably Mantegna's, as can be assumed from the inflexibly austere framing of the scene, the Child of Donatellian inspiration which placed on the ledge becomes a unit of measure for the scene's spatial depth, and even the physical features of the priest, resembling Squarcione's prototypes which had been familiar to Mantegna.Mantegna's Presentation is enclosed ineluctably within a square frame, a screen separating the group from the spectator; the figures are absorbed in an incisiveness that renders them detached and eternal in an absolute vision. In contrast with its architectural solidity and marmoreal rigour, Bellini's scene has a quite different rhythm, with modifications that are apparently insignificant but in reality substantial: the addition of two characters gives the group more life, splits it up and reassembles it into a small human crowd. The elimination of the frame, or rather its reduction to a pale, marbled shelf, somewhat akin to a church altar-top, suddenly removes every barrier and draws one toward the scene with a sense of intimacy. To the solid as rock colours of Mantegna, who blends flesh-tones, stones and drapery, he responds with a pure and orchestrated play of whites and reds in clear alternation.The views of critics about when the two works were painted do not concur, but it seems impossible to imagine that a long period of time separated their respective execution, as had been initially suggested, also by virtue of the diverse opinions regarding the precedence of the conception. It would be illuminating perhaps to discover the reasons that led to their execution, which do not appear to be a matter of chance, but almost certainly linked to family events, which with this important family portrait were solemnized

02884-apotheos.jpg	This small oil painting showing the Apotheosis of St Ignatius, the founder of the Jesuit order, is a bozzetto - a preparatory sketch for the fresco Baciccio executed for the vaulting of the left transept of the order's principal church of Il Ges&#249; in Rome. The bozzetto differs from the fresco only in a few of the angel figures and in the use of stronger colours. Although the apotheosis of the saint has a firm place in the overall ecclesiastical programme of the church, from which it cannot be dissociated, this oil study is nevertheless an independent painting, executed with greater care than one might expect of a sketch.The saint is carried heavenwards by a group of music-making, flower-strewing angels that are inebriated with joy. His arms spread wide, he soars towards a golden stream of light that is breaking through from the depths of the heavens. Baciccio does not treat this supernatural triumphal procession as a transcendental vision, but as a real occurrence. The body of the saint and the angels are not transcended by light, but are sculpturally tangible, and in its earthly corporeality, the painting mediates between the world of the spectator and the light whose source remains invisible to us, but which is perceptible in the figure of the saint.

10238-1venus11.jpg	Around 1525, Cranach (a leading painter of the German Renaissance, who had trained in Flemish studios) painted a Venus draped in a transparent veil gazing directly at the spectator, whose refined flowing lines are far-removed from the style of ancient statues. The fine brushwork captures every wrinkle in the bark of the tree and every feather in the wings. Cranach decided to accompany his nude figure with a moralizing couplet by the Humanist Chelidonius which reminds us that 'voluptas' is transitory and accompanied by pain, as the little Cupid realizes when he tastes the honeycomb with its stinging bees.The date 1531 inscribed on the painting is not thought to be original and it is believed that it has actually been executed around 1525.

05697-venus_ba.jpg	This canvas was painted for Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, marquise de Pompadour (1721-1764), mistress of Louis XV. It was installed in the bathroom in the Ch&#226;teau de Bellevue, outside Paris. Its more well known companion piece The Toilet of Venus is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The two paintings are among Boucher's most poetic and graceful images of one of his favourite subjects.The focus of the composition of the Bath of Venus is the youthful and beautiful Venus, the soft contours of her figure highlighted against the rich greens and blues of the background. A fine study in red and white chalks, drawn from a live model in the studio, demonstrates the care Boucher took in working out the pose. The youthful goddess is one in a long line of Boucher's female nudes. Although Boucher made life studies for each of these figures, their ultimate source is one of the most ravishing of all Rococo nudes, The Bather, painted by Boucher's teacher, Fran�ois Lemoyne, exhibited at the Salon of 1725

17229-copies21.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 677, JH 1972.A Scene from The Raising of Lazarus, after the etching by RembrandtOil on canvas, 48.5 x 63 cm. May 1890. Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Vincent van GoghIn Saint-R�my, van Gogh became interested in making copies in oil paint of prints by or after the works of those artists who represented for him the pantheon of modern art - Millet, Delacroix and Rembrandt, and Daumier, Dor� and the illustrators. He explained these copies in many ways. At one level, in the absence of models, he used them to practice his figure drawing and painting. At another level, he stated that by painting them in colour he was attempting to bring these artists, and what they stood for, before the public once again. This also enabled him to update them by demonstrating what he identified as his contribution to the tradition of modern art - colour. Thus he claimed, with reference to his copy of Rembrandt's Raising of Lazarus, that he was using colour to convey what Rembrandt had used chiaroscuro - tonal contrasts of black and white - to do.However, in the Rembrandt etching the pictorial device of light against dark was used to represent a religious theme; light emanates from the figure of Christ to dispel the surrounding darkness and thus depict the miracle of Christ raising a dead man. Van Gogh did not include the figure of Christ, and this omission precludes a religious reading of the image. Although there is a huge sun in the picture, it is not a pantheistic substitute; it is not a source of light.

36726-1allegor.jpg	The two paintings (Allegory of Time; Alexander the Great before the Tomb of Achilles), similar in size, were probably originally part of a larger cycle, to which a third canvas of Saul and Endor the Magus also must have belonged. These complicated subjects are not always readily comprehensible to modern scholars.After an initial artistic training in southern Germany, Sch�nfeld came to Rome in 1633. There he joined the Schildersbent, the informal band of Flemish, Dutch and German painters in Rome that included Poelenburg, Both, and Swanevelt. From a stylistic point of view, however, he was more influenced by his exposure to the neo-Venetian, classical experience of Poussin and his circle. Moving from Rome to Naples, where he stayed from 1638-39 to 1648, Sch�nfeld was an important vehicle for the transfer of this Roman style to that city. In the art world of Naples, where the hierarchical division between the genres was more pronounced, he specialized in painting subjects from ancient history and mythology. It was his aptitude in this area that drew the attention of Flavio Chigi, whom he met during the course of his second stay at Rome. Sch�nfeld would become one of the cardinal's favourite artists.The clear and subtle colours, the vibrant and nervous brushstrokes, and the strong, direct light render his figures evanescent and almost unstable. These elegant and elongated figures, derived from the engravings of Callot, are placed in strongly classical settings that are similar to contemporary theatrical scenes

20682-02jongk.jpg	When Jongkind visited Paris in 1860, with watercolours and wintry or moonlit landscapes he had done in Holland, he was so great a success with his fellow artists and the critics that he decided to concentrate  on the sought-after Dutch motifs of his home, Paintings such as View of Rouen date from the decade of his artistic breakthrough.

17401-ceres_ba.jpg	The Goltzius drawings that his contemporaries admired above all were his highly finished pen and inks drawings that simulate the swelling and tapering lines of engravings - they were called 'penwerken' (pen works). Dazzling examples of these virtuoso performances depicting Without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus would Freeze are at the British Museum, London, and the Hermitage, St. Petersburg). They illustrate the popular adage that without food (Ceres, the Roman god of agriculture) and wine (Bacchus), love (Venus) is left cold. Venus's need for the assistance of food and drink for invigoration was one of Goltzius's favourite themes, he represented the subject in various ways and media at least ten times. His most stunning illustration of the proverb is now at Philadelphia.Drawn with elaborate pen lines in ink that give the effect of an engraving, half-nude Venus is seen close-up accompanied by an adoring young satyr bearing fruit and a smiling old one with his hands full of luscious grapes, obvious representatives of Ceres and Bacchus. Handsome Cupid who turns sympathetically to us, holds a large flaming torch that warms as well as illuminates the figures. Unlike most of Goltzius's penworks which are done on paper or parchment, this one is on canvas with a grey-blue oil ground that is an integral part of the scene's nocturnal effect. Unique is the conspicuous addition of flesh tones in brush and oils that are literally and figuratively warmed by the vivid red, orange, and yellow flames of Cupid's torch, also done in oil paint.

24940-bielefe2.jpg	This panel showing the Crucifixion comes from a large dismantled retable probably made for the high altar of the former Kollegiatstift Sankt Maria und Sankt Georg, now the Neust&#228;dter Marienkirche in Bielefeld.One of the key monuments of late medieval painting in Westphalia, completed in 1400, the altarpiece was a triptych with folding wings about 6,56 maters wide when fully opened and about 2,18 meters high, including its lost frame. In the open state, it displayed a large central image of the Virgin and Child enthroned in the company of saints, flanked by thirty smaller scenes ranging from God Warns Adam about the Tree of Knowledge, through the life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion of Christ, to the Last Judgment, all on gold ground. The small scenes were arranged in three rows of ten, with the subjects progressing chronologically across each row, skipping over the Virgin and Child at centre, from the upper left to the lower right.The Crucifixion was located at the bottom row of the left wing. It shows the dead Christ on the Cross flanked by the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist. An additional female figure, probably the Virgin's sister Mary Cleophas, stands at the far left

15108-st_john.jpg	With Geertgen tot Sint Jans Netherlandish painting ventures into the deep waters of a mysticism and fantasy which are nearer to those of the German painters. The secular spirit seems to be beginning to take the stage: we are entering into a different kind of expression, in which man's own thought, his inventions and his dreams will impregnate his life and his surroundings.A good example is the St John in the Wilderness. With his cheek resting on one hand, the saint sits dreaming, thinking, meditating in the loveliest, most subtle, most tenderly green of landscapes, as the sun sets amid the flutter of wings, the piping of birds and the gentle ripping of the brook to which a stag has come down to drink. Behind St John the lamb is seen sitting, waiting for the prophecy to be accomplished and for the Lamb of God to came to him for Baptism. This link the picture with Van Eyck's Mystic Lamb - but in reverse order, so to speak, since here the scenes do not take place in their historical and chronological sequence.

Against the radiant sky that opens up beyond the faux balustrade painted by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna, four impetuous gray horses pull Apollo's chariot, which carries the betrothed couple, the god of light stands behind them. Cupid, blindfolded and bearing a torch, flies next to the chariot. Allegorical figures of the virtues, alluding to the couple's fortunate destiny, circle the scene. These include Fame, blowing a trumpet; the Three Graces, seated on a cloud just beneath Apollo's chariot; and Prudence, to whom flying putti bring a mirror. Beneath the cornice, on a large dark cloud, is an elderly bearded man wearing a laurel wreath. A representation of Merit, he holds a banner with the juxtaposed coats of arms of the two families. Next to him is a lion, symbol of Venice

26580-05_2ce5f.jpg	The fifth scene in the chronological order of the narrative, The Creation of Eve, is depicted in the centre of the vault of the fifth bay, between two pairs of ignudi with medallions. Michelangelo painted this scene immediately beyond the screen that originally divided the interior of the chapel into two almost equal parts. Proceeding from the entrance of the chapel towards the altar, the figure of the Lord appears for the first time in the Creation of Eve. He is also present in all the following scenes. The central position of this scene creates a further division in the nine scenes in the ceiling. This is in addition to the pattern created by the alteration of larger and smaller panels, and the arrangement by subject; three stories of the Creation of the world, three of Adam and Eve, and three of Noah, presented as the second Adam, saved from the flood, through the flood, seen as the symbol of the baptism.In the four ignudi who hold the yellow ribbons interwoven with the bronze-coloured medallions, the use of contrapposta with a variety of gestures and poses has now been replaced the symmetrical arrangement of figures. The relationship between the figures, placed opposite each other in pairs, is based on increasingly free and complex rhythmical correspondences, with rotating movements and pronounced bendings of the limbs.The subjects of the scenes painted on the bronze-coloured medallions are a matter of debate: the one surmounting the figure of the prophet Ezekiel (at the left) might represent the Destruction of the Tribe of Ahab, Followers of Baal, according to a different interpretation, the Death of Nicanor; the one above the Cumaean Sibyl (at the right) depicts either David before the prophet Nathan, or Alexander before the High Priest of Jerusalem

36611-morning.jpg	In his allegory of German regeneration, Morning, painted in 1813 for the militant Prussian nationalist August Wilhelm von Gneisenau, the view is imaginary, leading to a classical city by a sunlit sea, antique fragments of which lie overgrown in the foreground. This Mediterranean culture is intended to denote the Renaissance, and it is approached by two women in old German costume, with their children rushing before them. Like Friedrich's chasseur, two guards in plumed helmets symbolize the Napoleonic order now passing.

21715-p_interi.jpg	In the pictures of peasant interiors by the Le Nain brothers there is as much diversity as in the exterior scenes, and attempts have een made to group them round each of the brothers. The categories into which they have been divided make sense, even if no name can convincingly attached to each one. Closest to the Dutch models, especially to the art of Jan Miense Molenaer, is the group of peasant scenes painted on a minute scale. One of the best is the Peasant Interior in Washington, signrd 'Lenain fecit' and dated 1642.Although exquisitely painted, the figures seem to be in a very curious spatial relationship with one another; the mother seems far too small and the children far too big.

24100-7parnas1.jpg	Around 1495 Isabella d'Este planned to have the most famous painters of her time contribute pictures for her studiolo; she was unsuccessful in obtaining pictures from Leonardo (although he drew her portrait) and Giovanni Bellini, but not for want of trying. Mantegna, her court painter, and Lorenzo Costa, Mantegna's successor, each completed two canvases and Perugino one. Mantegna's so-called Parnassus, completed by 1497, is one of his finest works, much discussed and admired, although the exact meaning of the allegory remains elusive. As a painter dedicated to the study of antiquity and ancient archaeology, it is fitting that Mantegna should have produced a masterpiece with a classical theme.In the centre of the painting representing a mythological scene the dancing Muses are easily identifiable, both on account of their number and the presence of the mountains in the top left of the picture. There was a tradition that the song of the nine sisters caused volcanic eruptions and other cataclysms which could only be stopped by Pegasus stamping his hoof - and indeed we see, on the right, the winged and bejewelled horse engaged in his providential pawing of the ground. Beside him is Mercury, whose presence is justified by the protection which he (together with Apollo) afforded the adulteress in the love affair between Mars and Venus. The two lovers hold sway over the scene from the top of Parnassus; a bed is beside them. The cuckolded husband, Vulcan, springs out from the entrance of his forge, fulminating against the faithless pair. Apollo is seated lower down, his lyre in his hands. Mantegna has integrated the landscape elements with the figures, using rocky cliffs as foils, while the central arch permits a deep vista into the rolling landscape.In this late work Mantegna has maintained a monumental approach to human figures. Stocky and heavy-limbed, they plant their weight solidly in easy contrapposto

44612-mystic_m.jpg	On the basis of the coat of arms (top left), the picture can be linked to the wedding of Anna della Torre and Giambattista Pindemonte in Verona in 1547. There are problems with the state of conservation of the picture. Paint has rubbed off in places, and corrections and overpaintings by other hands make it difficult to judge the original work. X-rays of the right-hand side revealed another figure in the curtain area that was possibly lost during an earlier restoration. In the past, the painting was often attributed to the young Veronese. It is however an exemplary documentation of the mutual links between him and a group of contemporary Verona-based painters that included not only Zelotti but also Battista dell'Angelo del Moro, Paolo Farinati and Domenico Brusasorzi

24535-06olona.jpg	In the upper, semicircular panel of the east wall of the Baptistery, the scene representing the Baptism of Christ is depicted. Although the picture is divided into three separate settings, the connecting rock formations make it clear that we are witnessing a single event, where the baptism of both Christ and the neophytes in the Jordan are combined in a single composition.The Christ figure, which dominates the picture, stands knee-deep in the river's green waters, which snake forward out of the depth of the picture. To the right of John, who is administering baptism, are four men preparing for their own baptism by stripping off their clothes. The animated poses of the two men clad only in their undergarments show Masolino's mastery of human anatomy, doubtless acquired through life drawing.In the barrel vault, God the Father appears in a circular opening

18300-1014grec.jpg	"Likenesses have a special place in El Greco's work. Although he was primarily interested in painting religious subjects for ecclesiastical commissions, he also produced some outstandings portraits, often inserting them into his religious compositions, as for example in the famous ""Burial of Count Orgaz"" in Toledo. His formal portraits and studies from life are characterized by an element of drama and a penetrating insight into the character of the sitter. He was not interested in depicting the background, nor in the insignia of rank or office which would indicate the subject's worldly status or occupation, and his sitters nearly always face the spectator and their faces reveal the soul within.No doubt the Study of a Man is a likeness, though we do not know the identity of the model nor in what connection it came to be produced. The sketchy greenish-purplish draperies and the cloud-streaked blue background are a perfect foil for the thin ascetic face with its sparse beard. The picture was usually believed to represent El Greco himself, but as a result of recent research it is now thought to be one of a series of likenesses of the Apostles - painted from an unknown model in Toledo"

31251-perseus.jpg	"None of Piero di Cosimo's works are signed or dated, making a reconstruction of his stylistic development extremely tentative. The dating of this Andromeda Frees Perseus is therefore unclear, although critics are generally agreed that it is a work of the artist's maturity since it contains stylistic elements reflecting the transition to sixteenth-century art: the presence of Leonardesque ""sfumato"", the Raphaelesque typology of the figures and the proto-Mannerist character of the overall structure.Ovid tells how Andromeda, daughter of an Ethiopian king, was chained to a rock by the sea-shore as a sacrifice to a sea-monster. Perseus (the son of Dana&#235; whom Jupiter caused to conceive after turning himself into a shower of golden rain) flying overhead on Pegasus, the winged horse, fell in love at first sight.

35684-bentheij.jpg	Ruisdael's views of Bentheim Castle are perhaps his most famous works. Some sixteen of them survive, and they form a largely cohesive group of works in which the greatest of all Dutch landscape painters reveals an almost obsessive fascination with this memorable subject.Bentheim, a small town clustered round the foot of a hill dominated by a large castle after which it is named, is in Westphalia in Germany, about six miles from the border with the Netherlands. When Ruisdael visited it, almost certainly in 1650, and probably accompanied by his townsman Nicolaes Berchem, the town was no more than a few scattered houses on the lower slopes of the hill partly covered in oaks, but the castle was very much as it is today, dominating the surrounding plain. Travelling east from the province of North Holland, this is the first proper hill that Ruisdael would have encountered, made all the more dramatic by the fortified Schlo&#223; on its crown, and it is hardly surprising that it should have made such an impact on the young painter. The lowland landscapes, rivers, watermills and woods and the distinctive timber-framed buildings that Ruisdael saw in the Dutch province of Gelderland on his way to and from Bentheim served as the inspiration for much of his work in the ensuing years, and Ruisdael drew on them for the rest of his career.Ruisdael's characteristic response to Bentheim was to adapt what he had seen and drawn, and to recreate landscapes that are completely plausible but not topographically accurate. Ruisdael consistently exaggerates the height and steepness of the hill of Bentheim, his purpose in doing so is to show the castle atop its sandstone outcrop, dominating the viewer and towering over him

43758-02theait.jpg	In 1734 the French Comedy and the Italian Comedy were reproduced as copper engravings by C. N. Cochin. He named them respectively 'L'Amour au th�&#226;tre fran�ais' and 'L'Amour au th�&#226;tre italien', thus making the artist's intentions clear.The theatre plays an important part in Watteau's art. His teacher Gillot, with whom the twenty-year-old Flemish-born painter began his work in Paris, appears to have encouraged this interest in the theatre. Watteau's most famous portrait, the Gilles in the Louvre, is the portrayal of a stage character. Stage-play and reality are strangely interwoven, as they are also in his pictures of social occasions, the f&#234;tes galantes, which Watteau originated and executed with such artistry. These gained for him recognition by the French Academy.There is documentary evidence to show that, from 1769 onwards, this painting and its counterpart, the French Comedy, were in the picture gallery at Sanssouci, having previously formed part of the Henri de Rosnel Collection. The founders of the Berlin Museum, however, steeped as they were in the tradition of Goethe and Winckelmann, had no time for Watteau's art, despising its frivolity. The outstanding collection of the works of French painters that Frederick the Great had built up in Potsdam remained almost untouched when pictures were selected for the Berlin Gallery in 1830. Only two paintings by Watteau, which happened to be the smallest, met with the Commission's approval and were accepted for the Museum: The French Comedy and The Italian Comedy. The Enseigne de Gersaint, at that time only a few steps away in the Berlin Palace, was completely ignored.

The landscape backgrounds in these paintings - views through on the left, punctuated by impressive buildings - succeed in varying measure in avoiding the feel of a backdrop rather than real space.In the present painting the Precursor of Christ, having spent his entire life to date in the wilderness, enters the world to address the multitude.

25093-wings.jpg	"These two panels are the wings of a triptych, the central panel of which, the Last Judgment, is also found in the Brussels museum. The latter, however, is by a weaker hand. All three panels come from Zierikzee, where presumably the triptych originally hung in the courtroom in the town hall. This is one example of a so-called ""justice tableau"" (gerechtigheidstafereel), as commonly found in courtrooms in the Low Countries. The presentation of the Last Judgment and other edifying justice tableaux were intended to encourage judges to judge equitably.On the left hand panel we see Philip the Fair, in full armour, with uplifted sword in his right hand, presented as the ultimate earthly judge. He is crowned and wears, on his ermine cape, the chain of the Order of the Golden Fleece. His breast armour is decorated with the Burgundian, Austrian and Spanish coats of arms. His wife, Joan of Castile, also known as Joan the Mad, wears, above her brocade dress, a wide royal mantle on which the same coats of arms are recognisable. She too wears a crown on her head.Philip, the son of Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian of Austria, was born in 1478. In 1496 he married Joan of Castile, the daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. The latter died in 1504, allowing Philip to claim the Spanish throne as his inheritance. Given that Philip is clothed here with the symbols of royal power and himself died in January 1506, these portraits can be dated with considerable accuracy.Both the sovereigns are shown in the gardens of the palace of the Dukes of Burgundy on the Coudenberg in Brussels, more specifically in the area where the tournaments took place. In the background can be made out a part of the Brussels city wall and the two western towers of St Michael's cathedral, in those days dedicated to St Gudule.These panels belong to a group of works, the painter of which is known, in the absence of further details, as the Master of the Joseph Legend. It is not impossible that this master was Jacob van Laethem, who was admitted into the painters' guild in Antwerp in 1493. Van Laethem received commissions from the court, mainly for decorative works, on various occasions and accompanied Philip the Fair on his trips to Spain"

Our gaze is drawn upwards towards the saint, whose eyes are also looking upwards to higher things.

17155-portra07.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 462, JH 1574.In August 1888 van Gogh told his brother of his plan to paint a picture of an artist friend - he called him a dreamer - using exaggerated colours. Instead of the plain background of an ordinary room, he would create the effect of a night sky, against which the head would stand out 'like the mysterious brightness of a pale star in the infinite'. This letter indicates the kind of meanings van Gogh wanted portraits to convey. As ever, he did not feel constrained to attend to the specific identity or character of the person who sat as his model.In this portrait the Belgian Eug�ne Boch, a painter by profession, is portrayed as van Gogh's image of a dreaming poet. He is simply shown, dressed in modern costume, but to the background stars have been added. Van Gogh later called the portrait 'Poet against a Starry Sky'. Boch is painted in a combination of brilliant yellows against deep blues. The placement of a man's head against the imaginative background of a starry night was meant to raise the portrait to the level of a more symbolic representation, the artist as dreamer, a statement about the artist's own dislocation from immediate social reality. The problem was that despite such ambitious ideas for the modern portrait, based on combinations of colour and assisted by symbolic attributes, van Gogh could not convey such a burden of meaning without the ample textual explication he was obliged to offer in his letters

It is likely that this painting, as well as the entire fresco cycle, was commissioned by Gottardo Panigarola, Chancellor to Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan. According to Lamazzo, the cycle portrays the most famous men-at-arms of the time; Pietro Suola the Elder, Giorgio Moro da Ficino and Beltrame.A certain exuberance in the architectural details of the niche, as well as the lucid, incisive form of the drapery and the hair, show the probable influence on Bramante of north Italian art. The example of Melozzo da Forli and Mantegna is also apparent. Bramante's desire to make the figure heroic, and the frozen violence of the Roman pose, give the composition a remote rarefied air

15339-poggio1.jpg	Of all the Medici villas in the environs of Florence, Poggio Imperiale has the most imposing site and is also closest to the Palazzo Pitti, which became the official residence of the grand dukes in 1561. The property came into the possession of Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565. From 1618 Maria Magdalena of Austria, the wife of Cosimo II de' Medici invested  a great sum on improvements made under the direction of Giulio Parigi. In 1624 the property was officially named Poggio Imperiale with reference to the grand duchess's imperial lineage. The lineage was also featured in the ambitious pictorial program of the public rooms and bedrooms which lay on the ground floor. However, the villa was stripped of its precious furnishings and art treasures from the seventeenth century under the Habsburg-Lorraine regency (1737-65).The decoration of Poggio Imperiale started again under the reign of Peter Leopold (1747-1792) who succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Tuscany when his eldest brother became emperor as Joseph II in 1765. This decoration was intended to set a new artistic direction and propagate new standards of taste: Neoclassicism.Three rooms in the south wing were frescoed in 1768-72 by Tommaso Gherardini and Giuliano Traballesi with the collaboration of Giuseppe del Moro, one of the best Tuscan perspective painters of the time. It was followed by the decoration of five rooms in the west wing in 1773-78. Here the frescoes were executed by Giuseppe Maria Terreni, Giuseppe Gricci, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini, and Tommaso Gherardini.The distinctive pictorial program in the south suite, blending mythological, allegorical, and historical elements, is still largely undeciphered. In the first room, Gherardini and the quadratura painter Giuseppe del Moro painted on the ceiling the Origin of the Roman Empire. In the lower portion of the tall rectangular panel, in a rolling landscape guarded by the river god Tiber, is the classical motif of the she-wolf nursing the abandoned twins Romulus and Remus, children of the vestal virgin Rhea Silvia and the war god Mars.Images showing the decorations of the various rooms in the Villa Poggio Imperiale can be viewd on the respective pages of Tommaso Gherardini, Giuliano Traballesi, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Maria Terreni, and Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini

18761-guard303.jpg	This canvas is one of the 12 Venetian Festivities that Guardi painted, based on engravings made between 1763 and 1766 by Giovanni Battista Brustolon, modelled on original drawings by Canaletto. They begin with the ceremonies organised in May 1763 marking the election and enthronement of Doge Alvise IV Mocenigo, who was to reign over Venice for 15 years. This painting illustrates the first of the solemnities in the chronological order of events.The newly-elected Doge is led to the basilica where he swears his oath of office before being presented to his fellow-citizens and enthroned. Flanked by two electors, he is addressing the people from the raised pulpit to the right of the choir. On his head he wears a square barretta and not the ducal hat, as he has not yet been crowned. The rejoicing crowd has invaded the basilica, is pressing into the nave and aisles, has climbed onto the bases of the columns and is even occupying the upper galleries. It is acclaiming its future sovereign with such exuberance that arsenal workers, armed with long red staves, have to clear a pathway for the Doge. The latter has still to show himself on the sella gestatoria or pozzetto in front of the choir screen, and then to be carried on the arsenal workers' shoulders towards St Mark's Square.In this perfectly symmetrical composition, in which he has applied the rules of a broad, dilated central perspective, Guardi presents a multitude of excited figures with an almost carnival-like flavour. The bustling little silhouettes are seized with astounding virtuosity with a few nervous brush strokes and quick, fragmented touches of bright colours. This milling throng is in contrast to the imposing solemnity of the building, the vast interior of which bathes in a warm, golden atmosphere. The play of light and shadow imparts a glitter to the gold of the mosaics and shows off the mattness of the marbles. The precise chromatic range, the light, elegant touch, and the brilliant, dynamic arrangement, full of imagination, which distinguish this work, allow us to situate it around 1775/77. This series, the other parts of which are preserved at the Louvre in Paris (10) and the Museum of Grenoble (1), is one of the most remarkable creations of 18th century Venetian painting

36083-2david1.jpg	On the other shorter wall (the window wall) there are three other scenes. In the centre David Dances before the Ark of the Covenant. We can see the figure of Michal, gazing out of the window, who sees David dancing and despises him for it, because he had thereby uncovered himself before the handmaids of his servants as only fools uncover themselves.The scene above the centre image represents David Spares the Sleeping Saul. The third scene at the top left corner depicts Michal Rescues David from Saul's Persecution.To the left and right of the picture of David dancing, we find, on the picture frame, two naked or only very lightly clothed youths. They belong not to the depicted scene but rather to the world of paired figures who hold chiaroscuro images on the other walls above the scenes.

Instead, he had a new painting on the same subject executed by Romulo Cincinnato. Since both works have survived, we can gain a good idea of the king's points of criticism. Surprisingly, there is a great conformance between the two pictures in terms of composition, so we may assume that Cincinnato was asked follow El Greco's model. A difference, on the other hand, is seen in Cincinnato's stronger emphasis on the execution scene, which has been brought into the foreground

31012-st_jamex.jpg	To the testament of Andrea Stazio, a Venetian nobleman who died in 1722, we owe a cycle of paintings of great importance in the history of Venetian art. The will provided that twelve canvases should be painted for the church of San Stae (Venetian for St Eustace). All similar in size, they depict episodes in the lives of the Apostles and their martyrdom. The commission was given to twelve different Venetian painter, ranging from the aged Nicol&#242; Bambini, then seventy-one, through to Giambattista Tiepolo, almost at the start of his career.All the paintings were completed within a few months, in 1722 and early 1723. The artists were the following in alphabetic order: Antonio Balestra, Nicol&#242; Bambini, Gregorio Lazzarini, Silvestro Manaigo, Giambattista Mariotti, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giambattista Piazzetta, Giambattista Pittoni, Sebastiano Ricci, Giambattista Tiepolo, Angelo Trevisano and Pietro Uberti. They vied with each other to transform the church into a remarkable showcase of currents and developments in eighteenth-century Venetian art.Piazzetta's Martyrdom of St James is part of the cycle of the Apostles which as a 'collective exhibition' fortunately remained intact in the choir of the Baroque church San Stae, giving an outline of Venetian painting of the period.The small, light-suffused head of the rider emerging from the deep shadows in the foreground only just manages to soften the tension created by the contrast between the ruffian's brutality and the obstinate determination of the apostle, guided and illuminated by his faith

As the artistic production of this master continues to be more clearly defined and studied from the technical point of view, it has become evident that some works in the oeuvre of Jan Gossart most likely belong to this group as well: the Holy Family in Saint Louis, the Lucretia in a private collection, and the Portrait of a Man in Hamilton.This master was influenced in part by Gossart's works in the 1520s but never entirely abandoned his attachment to Antwerp Mannerism

24352-insects.jpg	Among the Dutch still-life painters Otto Marseus van Schrieck has a special position. His somewhat exotic oeuvre has only come to be appreciated in more recent decades. He nearly always presents a small section of the woods with thick dark undergrowth, and a hidden microcosm in which frogs, toads, snakes and lizards crowd together, fighting for their lives. Marseus van Schrieck knew the habits of these animals very well and is known to have bred reptiles and snakes himself. This painting also shows bizarre botanical species, such as a coral fungus on the left and thistles, under which a lizard - a so-called lacerta - is hiding, about to attack the toad.Marseus van Schrieck has designed an idealized habitat, modelled on biological dioramas, which are illustrations with a three-dimensional effect. However, although the world of his paintings reflects the zoological and botanical interests of a well-versed science amateur, it is still not free from religious associations. Indeed, it is the religious meaning which determines the selection and composition of the animals and plants. The snake, the toad and the lizard are the 'unclean animals', the serpent had negative connotations and was regarded as an incarnation of evil, and such, was a favourite subject for depicting evil

24238-salute.jpg	This impressive view of the entrance to the Grand Canal is dominated by Santa Maria della Salute, built between 1631 and 1687 by Baldassare Longhena in gratitude for the conclusion of the disastrous plague which had struck Venice in 1630. The veduta is taken from the loggia of the monastery of San Gregorio on the corner of the Grand Canal and the Rio della Salute. The Rio separates the monastery from the Campo della Salute and is visible in the foreground on the right. Just beyond the basilica, on the same side of the canal, is the episcopal seminary. Above the adjacent blind wall we see the tower of the Dogana da Mar. On the left side of the canal parts of Palazzo Manolesso and Palazzo Contarini Fasan can just be seen. Further in the background we can spot the Campanile of San Marco. Finally, on the horizon, the buildings of the Riva degli Schiavoni and the Castello area can be descried through the masts of the boats. The water, meanwhile, is dotted with gondolas and cargo boats, one of which is loaded with cases marked 'Roma', 'Vienna:' and 'M:S:', the last possibly Marieschi's signature. The vessels, such as the boat with the lateen sail at the quay, are closely observed.The mast of the boat with the lateen sail divides the scene in two equal halves, while the long, crooked yard and the quay wall, arranged almost perpendicular to the picture plane, serve to balance the composition. The veduta spans a wide angle, roughly one hunderd fifty degrees. Two vanishing points, one on the extension of the quay line and the other outside the image to the right, make the corner which closed off the Campo della Salute sharper than it is. Besides this deformation, as it were, of the square, it is remarkable how the lowest part of the church seems to move toward the spectator whereas the large dome withdraws. The effect resembles that of a fish-eye lens; Marieschi may have used a camera obscura in making this painting.It is precisely the uncorrected deformations in this spectacular composition that distinguish it from Canaletto's treatment of the same motif. Marieschi's older colleague gives us a considerably more peaceful, more balanced view (Royal Collection, Windsor)

23114-10carme3.jpg	This painting formed the central panel of the predella of the dismembered altarpiece in the Carmelite church San Niccol&#242; al Carmine in Siena. The five scenes in the predella depict events in the history of the Carmelite Order: The Annunciation to Sobac, Hermits at the Fountain of Elijah, St Albert Presents the Rule to the Carmelites, The Pope Issues a Bull to a Carmelite Delegation, and The Approval of the New Carmelite Habit by Pope Honorius IV.The long central predella and the next two scenes represent the modern documented history of the Carmelite Order. Some time between 1206 and 1214, Albert, Patriarch of Jerusalem, traveled to Mount Carmel an presented the hermits with a Rule. The Rule was accepted by Pope Honorius III in 1226 with a papal bull.

18406-1906grec.jpg	It is sometimes held that this small painting is not the work of El Greco himself. A great many pictures representing apostles were produced in El Greco's workshop, all faithfully executed in traditional style, and it is certain that no small number of them were painted by his pupils. However, the quality of this small size painting makes it probable that it was made by the painter himself.The painting depicts the Apostle St Andrew who converted the 'Scythians'; he was the brother of Peter and because he had been a follower of St John the Baptist he was known in the Greek-Christian tradition as Protocleitos (the first of those called). Andrew was the apostle of Byzantium and the gentle affection with which El Greco painted the likeness of the wise old man may be traced back to his childhood memories of Crete. He follows the traditional iconographical way of indicating inevitable martyrdom by depicting St Andrew with the upright of the cross over his shoulder, but the heavy wooden upright is a symbol and not an organic part of the composition. The essence of the picture is the majestic figure of the old apostle in his voluminous cloak; it is a study of a patient and wise teacher. El Greco very skilfully represents the shining silver hair and beard, and reveals exceptional mastery of his art in the painting of the face, especially the eyes, and in the harmony he creates by the use of blue-green-yellow hues in the cloak. For all these reasons this picture must be classed among the finest of El Greco's smaller works

19093-09chilnu.jpg	As this picture clearly shows, in his early commissioned portraits Hals adhered more closely to the old technique and to accepted conventions than in his genre works. During the first decades of his career he continued to follow the ancient idea of adjusting his style to his subject. Of course it is appropriate that the gestures and expressions of the nurse and the elegantly dressed Catherina are more refined than those used by a boisterous group celebrating carnival.The double portrait is an excellent early example of Hals's subtle invention. The nurse, it seems, was about to present an apple to the young child when both were diverted by the approach of a spectator, to whom they appear to turn spontaneously, one of the many ingenious devices used by Hals to give the impression of a moment of life in his pictures. The colour scheme still shows the dark tonality of his early commissioned portraits, and the minute execution of the child's richly embroidered costume is set off by a delightful vivacity in the brushwork on the faces and hands.In 1635 Catharina became the teen-age bride of extremely wealthy Cornelis de Graeff who later served repeatedly as burgomaster of Amsterdam and became the city's guiding political force as well as adviser and confidant of Johan de Witt, Holland's leading statesman after the middle of the century

04259-urban8.jpg	The unfinished picture, formerly attributed to Sacchi, depicts the pope with an immediacy and expressive force that is manifested in the rapid brushstrokes. The composition, datable to 1632, is directly related to Bernini's drawing for the engraved portrait of the pope on the frontispiece of Urban VIII's Poemata (engraved by C. Mellan 1631).The inventories of the Barberini collection indicate the presence of other portraits that Bernini painted of the pope. A slightly later example, of strong expressive force and originally in the Barberini collection, recently reappeared in a private collection.

03301-desco1.jpg	The custom of presenting expensive gift to a new mother on the occasion of giving birth was widespread among the upper middle classes in renaissance Tuscany. Commonly these gifts took the form of either a five-piece maiolica set (including a broth bowl and cover, drinking cup, saltcellar, and lid) or a painted 'desco da parto' (tray, both of which were luxury imitations of functional objects, intended for presentation and display only. The imagery adapted for these objects was invariably secular, generally literary or mythological in source, frequently aristocratic or courtly in content, sometimes emblematic or moralising in theme. Occasionally, as in this case or in that of a celebrated tray by Masaccio, the trays are painted reportage, with the birth scene itself figured on the recto, enacted in contemporary interior by figures in contemporary dress; they function as precious documents of the social habits of the age.The birth scene on the recto of this tray is a faithful copy of a drawing by Lorenzo Monaco representing the Birth and naming of St John the Baptist.

In the distinct contrast between the serene pose and inward-focused expression of the crucified Christ, on the one hand, and the agitation of the mourning angels on the other, we still feel the influence of the Crucifixion fresco in the Scrovegni Chapel, though the added thieves and crowd gathered below the crosses conform to the archetype of the densely populated paintings of Golgotha that in the meantime had become common in Trecento painting

03776-057ferr.jpg	The polyptych of St Vincent Ferrer, executed for the altar dedicated to the saint in the Venetian basilica of St John and St Paul, is Bellini's first public assignment. It comprises nine panels arranged in three parts: above the Piet&#224; with the Virgin and the Angel of the Annunciation at the side; in the centre the titular saint with St Christopher and St Sebastian at the sides; in the predella five miracles of the saint. Formerly the painting was crowned by a lunette which is lost.Champion of the Dominican Order, ardent and threatening preacher and controversialist, early confessor and later bitter adversary of Benedict XIII, the Spanish saint had been sanctified in 1455 and immediately the Order had committed itself to a vast campaign of propaganda and assertion of the cult.The looming figures of the central register, furrowed by the lines of their bodies and drapery, are emphasized by a brilliant light shining from below. The measure of their perspective is expressed by one or two basic elements: the arrows of St Sebastian, the stout staff of St Christopher in the foreground. Above, the Christ in Piet&#224; (which, as always, faithfully follows a Byzantine iconographical model) is enclosed between an announcing angel and a Madonna with extremely limpid colours. In the angel, especially, the colours are blended with an almost glassy quality, and their pallid and alabastrine splendour contrasts with the sudden blaze of red curtain behind the Virgin. The space is suggested by small details in an almost unnoticed and yet essential way: the deep dark folds of the curtain, and the sharp cold corner of the marmoreal pillar

18389-1802grec.jpg	Apostle, was brother of Peter, a Galilean fisherman, and the first to follow Christ (John 1:40-41). The gospels contribute little to his iconography; the chief source is the apocryphal book of the 'Acts of Andrew' (3rd century), retold in the Golden Legend. According to this he made missionary journeys to Scythian Russia, Asia Minor and Greece, preaching and performing many acts of healing. At Nicaea he delivered the inhabitants from seven demons who plagued them in the shape of dogs. At Thessalonica the parents of a young man whom he had converted to Christianity set fire to his house, with Andrew and their son in it. When the young man miraculously extinguished the fire by sprinkling a small bottle of water over the flames, his parents, still seeking vengeance, tried to enter the house by climbing ladders, but were immediately struck blind. The Golden Legend tells of a bishop dining with the devil, disguised as a courtesan. Just as he was about to yield to Satan, Andrew entered in the garb of a pilgrim, and drove the devil away. Andrew was executed by Egeas, the Roman governor of Patras in the Peloponnese. The governor's wife, Maximilla, being cured of a fatal sickness by the apostle, adopted Christianity and was persuaded by him to deny her husband his marital rights ever again. This, and not his preaching, seems to have been the cause of Andrew's imprisonment and subsequent crucifixion.Andrew is the patron saint of Greece and Scotland. Among differing accounts of his relics, one tells of their being carried to the town of St Andrews in Scotland in the 4th century.Apostle St Andrew in ArtHe is usually portrayed as an old man, white-haired and bearded. His chief attribute is a cross in the shape of an X, or saltire, though in earlier Renaissance painting he may have the more familiar Latin cross. He sometimes has a net containing fish, or a length of rope (he was bound, not nailed, to the cross). His inscription from the Apostles' Creed is: 'Et in Jesum Christum, filium ejus unicum Dominum nostrum'. All these episodes from the legends are depicted, also the stages of his martyrdom: scourging; led by soldiers to his execution; being tied to the cross; crucifixion; burial, assisted by Maximilla

32213-18echo_n.jpg	Narcissus and Echo: a story of a handsome youth and the nymph who loved him but whose love was not returned. In Ovid's sad rendering of the myth (Met. 3:339-510) Echo was condemned by the goddess Juno to repeat only the last words that were spoken to her; Narcissus, as a punishment for spurning Echo, was made to fall in love with his own reflection, and pined away gazing at himself in a pool. At his death he was changed into flower that bears his name, and Echo in sorrow wasted away until nothing but her voiced remained.In this representation Narcissus lies dead beside the water while Echo in the background grieves over him

32239-12neptun.jpg	The lightness of tone is seen in the Triumph of Neptune in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, a picture almost certainly painted for Richelieu and probably rather earlier than the three large Bacchanals for the ch&#226;teau. The composition of the Triumph of Neptune is derived from Raphael's fresco in the Villa Farnese, but the result is unfortunately a little pedantic; when looking too closely at other art, Poussin forgot to relax and somehow stopped letting his own special intensity dominate. The result is light-hearted and decorative, and its subject has been interpreted in many different ways.The mythological story depicted here is the following.Amphitrite fled from Neptune's wooing, but he sent dolphins after her which succeeded in persuading her to return to become his bride. She rides beside his chariot on a dolphin's back, an arch of drapery billows over her head, a common feature of sea-goddesses from antiquity. They are surrounded by a retinue of Tritons (the name for mermen in general) and Nereids (sea-nymphs, the daughters of Nereus, the 'old man of the sea' in Greek mythology).The painting was probably painted for Cardinal Richelieu. It has been subject to widely differing interpretations

24454-tribute.jpg	The episode depicts the arrival in Capernaum of Jesus and the Apostles, based on the account given in Matthew's Gospel. Masaccio has included the three different moments of the story in the same scene: the tax collector's request, with Jesus's immediate response indicating to Peter how to find the money necessary, is illustrated in the centre; Peter catching the fish in Lake Genezaret and extracting the coin is shown to the left; and, to the right, Peter hands the tribute money to the tax collector in front of his house. This episode, stressing the legitimacy of the tax collector's request, has been interpreted as a reference to the lively controversy in Florence at the time on the proposed tax reform; the controversy was finally settled in 1427 with the institution of an official tax register, which allowed a much fairer system of taxation in the city. There are other references and allusions which have been pointed out by scholars.Ever since the earliest scholars began writing about this fresco they showed special interest in the realistic details, which they noticed and pointed out despite the disappearence of the colour caused by the lampblack and the thick gluey substance that misguided restorers repeatedly applied to the surface of the frescoes over the centuries. Today it has finally become easier to appreciate the wealth of fascinating details, thanks to the recent restoration: Peter's fishing rod, the large open mouth of the fish he has caught, described down to the smallest details, the transparent water of the lake and the circular ripples spreading outwards, toward the banks.The awareness that they are about to witness an extraordinary event creates in the characters an atmosphere of expectation. Behind the group of people we can see a sloping mountainous landscape, with a variety of colours that range from dark green in the foreground to the white snow in the background, ending in a luminous blue sky streaked with white clouds painted in perfect perspective. The hills and the mountains that rise out from the plains, dotted with farmhouses, trees and hedges, have an entirely new and earthy concreteness: a perfect use of linear perspective, which will be taken up by Paolo Uccello, Domenico Veneziano and Piero della Francesca.The figures are arranged according to horizontal lines, but the overall disposition is circular: this semicircular pattern was of classical origin (Socrates and his disciples), although it was later adopted by early Christian art (Jesus and the Apostles), and interpreted by the first Renaissance artists, such as Brunelleschi, as the geometric pattern symbolizing the perfection of the circle. The characters are entirely classical: dressed in the Greek fashion, with tunics tied at the waist and cloaks wrapped over their left shoulder, around the back, and clasped at the front, below their left forearm. And even Peter's stance, as he extracts the coin from the fish's mouth, with his right leg bent and his left one outstretched, is reminiscent of postures of many statues by Greek artists, as well as reliefs on Etruscan funerary urns and Roman carvings

19828-3meyer2.jpg	There is a companion-piece of this painting, the portrait of the sitter's husband, Jakob Meyer zum Hasen. The architecture provides a link between the two portraits and creates a shared space for the figures; prior to Holbein, such a pictorial concept was unknown in Basel panel painting. The same applies to the decorative elements on the architecture, derived from the Italian Renaissance, such as the coffered vault and the acanthus leaf frieze, which incorporates two putti.The gilded coffering and pillar enhance the appearance of sober opulence in this striking and forthright depiction of Dorothea Kannengiesser, the second wife of Jakob Meyer. Their double-portrait, signed and dated 1516, was probably commissioned to celebrate Meyer's election as burgomaster. This had crucial repercussions for Holbein's career; evidently pleased with such an impressive diptych from so young an artist, Meyer gained Holbein numerous commissions in the following few years. Meyer was a member of the increasingly important mercantile class in Basel and the first of its members to achieve significant administrative power. (The coin he holds signifies his money-dealing role and also perhaps Basel's new-found permission to mint coins.) His friends and colleagues were therefore in the financial position to aid Holbein through their patronage. Meyer's tenure was brief, however - in 1521 he was impeached for accepting a larger bribe than was permitted from the French, imprisoned when he protested at his treatment and barred from office thereafter. He remained a Catholic after the city's secession to the reformed religion and led the Catholic party in the city: Holbein would perceive such strength of character again, in the analogous determination of Sir Thomas More to remain true to his faith

03964-bello104.jpg	The painting is part of a cycle of four canvases which are similar in shape and subject matter. The young Bellotto painted them during a seminal visit to Rome. Gradually, he was to move away from the faithful view of glimpses of Roman monuments. Instead he favoured the freer capriccio or imaginary view. This still included real buildings (which were truthfully reproduced) but they were set in an eclectic combination of invented architecture which in turn was given an evocative setting.

00638-madchild.jpg	One is struck by the extraordinary originality of this composition, constructed on an X-shaped scheme which may be discerned beneath the violent emotional expressiveness of the three protagonists. The Madonna's sweet face is shadowed by the soft chiaroscuro that also gives depth and body to the colours. She is seated on the ground, like the traditional madonna of Humility, filling the space diagonally. In a dramatically unstable pose between her knees, a Child Jesus with an elongated body transforms the jocular movements of a putto into a tragic contortion of the limbs and of the smile, in the awareness of his destiny which is matched by a range of colours unusually cold for Andrea, based on subtle relations between grey and violet.Andrea del Sarto painted this large Madonna for the Florentine businessman Giovanni Gaddi

24015-1chapel.jpg	Mantegna's first important commission from Ludovico Gonzaga was the decoration of the chapel in Castello di San Giorgio, executed in the first half of the 1460s. It is unfortunately impossible to reconstruct the whole of Mantegna's original intentions there with any confidence, although some panels almost certainly traceable to the chapel still survive. They include three paintings in the Uffizi: The Ascension of Christ, The Circumcision and The Adoration of the Magi. Today they are mounted as a triptych in the Uffizi with The Adoration of the Magi in the centre. They were given this format in 1827, but the inconsistencies in both composition and iconography indicate that these are individual works rather than parts of a uniformly planned altarpiece. Nevertheless, they were created for the same chapel.The three Magi symbolize both the three ages of man and also the three continents known at that time, Asia, Europe, and Africa. The adherents of different cultures among the followers of the kings are depicted realistically - they were familiar because of the activities of cosmopolitan Venice, a major trading centre and slave market

15558-4naming.jpg	"The Birth of St John the Baptist and the Zacharias Writes Down the Name of his Son can be found on the second level of the right wall.Ghirlandaio has made this composition animated by the unusual device of placing the most important group of people, who are standing around Zacharias, off centre. This means that the baby John is in the centre directly under the middle pilaster. The open loggia architecture with a view onto a landscape in the background is not connected with the events in the picture. It is possible that it was added, as a backdrop, late in the production of the work.Ghirlandaio places the seated priest Zacharias in front of a magnificent loggia which opens out onto an extensive landscape. Vasari writes how Zacharias, ""whose spirit is undaunted although he is still mute, expresses amazement that a son has been born to him, and while they ask him what name to give his son, he writes on his knees - all the while staring at his son, who is held by a woman kneeling reverently before him - forming with a pen on paper the words 'His name will be John', to the astonishment of many of the other figures, who seem to be wondering whether this could be true or not.""There exists a preparatory drawing for the scene showing St John's naming, in which the two secondary female figures on the far right were sketched. Neither of them play a part in the narrative, but guide us via the figure seen from behind on the right, where this scene borders the birth scene, into the pictorial fields and, by means of the direction they are gazing in, draw the attention of the picture's observer to the central event taking place, the naming. At the same time, the two women exist as independent optical sensations. They decorate the pictorial field like a frame, a harmonious group that is pleasant to look at. Ghirlandaio drew the same young woman seen from two different points of view, from the front and behind, just as they then appeared on the fresco"

09611-night.jpg	The painting was commissioned in October 1522 and completed at the end of the decade. It has been described as the first monumental nocturnal scene in European painting, and it is an ideal companion to the Madonna with St Jerome, also known as The Day, painted only a few years earlier for another private chapel.The artist, following the trail blazed by a number of celebrated works by Titian, interprets a scene that is fully '&#224; la chandell' and produces an outstanding result. The light appears simultaneously to bathe and to emerge from the Child, who is lying on a rough pallet, only to soften on the face of the Virgin, tenderly rapt in a maternal embrace. They are surrounded by the fluid gestures of the shepherds and of St Joseph, who is holding back the donkey, and by the kicking legs of the angels transported by the cloud that spreads hazily through the picture.Although attenuated by the dim nocturnal light that tones down all the shades, the painting is not lacking in color and the chiaroscuro spreads over and softens every form, bringing out their rotundities and caressing those leaves that are reminiscent of Leonardo and Veneto-Ferrarese painting. It is a picture that points the way toward the future Lombard investigation of luministic effects, and was used as a model by such painters as Procaccini, Reni, and Domenichino, and even later on, by Barocci and Maratta.

29199-09munkac.jpg	"""The Condemned Cell I"" brought his first great success for Munk�csy in 1869. Later he produced several version of this theme. This second one differs from the first only in its size. It depicts the last hourst of a young lad who is condemned to death. The village folks are watching him curiously, the facial expression and gestures of every one of them shows a different kind of response: surprise, pity, or wen indifference. The lad's clenched hand and the Bible thrown onto the floor reveal of his outhursting fury.Munk�csy painted this canvas during the years he spent at the Munich art academy, where the psychological approach was very fashionable a that time. Having assimilated this trend, Munk�csy depicted the event with emotionally differenciated facial expressions and gestures. The bright white paint in the dark basic colour of the picture generates a grim effect - in accordance with the mental state of the characters. The use of many characters  and their arrangement is theatrical to a certain degree - and in this respect the picture is reminiscent of the anedotical German genre style - nevertheless, its honest way of rendering and its sensitivity for the issues of this age make this painting a true masterpiece of Realism"

06607-sthubert.jpg	"This painting is a fruit of collaboration between Rubens and Jan Brueghel, the former being responsible for the figures and the latter for the landscape.St Hubert was born in the middle of the seventh century, son of a Duke of Aquitaine. He was elected as Bishop of Maastricht around 705. Later he was transferred to Liege, becoming its first bishop, and evangelised the Ardennes.At the end of the middle ages, his life was enriched with a number of episodes borrowed from the legend of St Eustace, in particular his encounter with a miraculous stag. One Good Friday Hubert, a fearsome hunter, fell upon a stag with a crucified Christ between its antlers. Blinded in the manner of St Paul on the road to Damascus, he fell from his horse and knelt down. He heard a voice, ""Hubert, Hubert, why do you pursue me? Will your love of hunting make you forever forgetful of your salvation?"" Hubert immediately changed his life and retired to the forest of Ardennes. He then succeeded St Lambert as Bishop of Maastricht and performed numerous miracles. St Hubert now is the patron saint of hunters, and protector of hunting dogs"

26161-0341virg.jpg	Although this little work is abraded in places, its original delicate quality can still be observed in the sharp features, the thin shapes of the limbs and hand and the fine folds. However, it cannot be a Memling. Neither the facial type nor the weak, doll-like structure bears witness to his hand. It is one of those Virgin-and-Child compositions in the manner of the master which may be based on a Memling prototype. This prototype would then most likely be situated early in his career, around the time of the New York tondo or the Virgin of the Wernher Collection. Roughly of the same type, but full-length, is Memling's Granada Virgin. And the golden background with dark clouds is reminiscent of the wings with an Angel with an olive-branch and an Angel with a sword (Paris-London).The type is based on a composition by Rogier van der Weyden, which is itself only known from a workshop replica (Chicago, Art Institute) and from a copy in the style of Memling. Since Memling applied the type once again in the triptych with the Adoration of the Magi (Madrid, Museo del Prado), one can assume that Memling disposed of a cartoon or model of this composition

Essentially a romantic rather than a realistic interpretation of nature, the principal subject of the picture is the spirit of peace and calm that envelops the earth at dusk.

07468-091lute.jpg	"The painting is on an extended loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from a private collection.Two pictures (one in The Hermitage, St. Petersburg, and the other in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) of almost the same dimensions depict a boy with soft facial features and unusually thick brown hair, pouting lips, a half-open mouth and a pensive expression beneath sharply-drawn broad eyebrows. His white shirt is open at the front, revealing the artist's intention to paint a nude. This figure has the same dimensions in both pictures, which suggests that Caravaggio traced one on to oil-paper. In this case only one picture was completed from a fresh study of a model.A sort of ribbon woven into the figure's hair emphasizes its almost androgynous features. The same applies - in the New York version - to a broad yoke which divides his shirt under his chest like a woman's dress. This is undoubtedly why Bellori saw this as a female lute-player, although recently it has been suggested that the model was a castrato. Light falls from a high window above left, creating a narrow triangle of brightness in the upper right-hand corner. That said, the brightly illuminated figure stands out boldly against the shadowy background.The strongly foreshortened lute with its bent key-board demonstrates Caravaggio's virtuoso handling of perspective. Tactile elements project towards the viewer more successfully than in the New York Concert. As in the Uffizi Bacchus, the artist places a broad table-top in front of the figure - in the St. Petersburg version it is made of marble, and in the New York version covered with an oriental carpet.The objects in the picture include an open book of music lying on another which bears the inscription ""Bassus"" in Gothic script, whilst the body of a violin serves to hold the book open at the right page. In both versions Caravaggio has painted the scores of older compositions clearly enough for us to read them. The music in question is the base voice-part of a popular collection, the ""libro primo"" of Jacques Arcadelt, which contains other compositions as well as works by this composer. Although the artist has cut off one row of notes, he has reproduced the initial notes so exactly that in the St. Petersburg example we can recognize the Roman printer, Valerio Dorica, whereas in the second version we can see that the book was published in Venice by Antonio Gardane.In the St. Petersburg version, the violin bow lies across the strings and the open book of music - a prominent object for the observation of light and shade. In the New York version it is handled in a much less interesting way. Placed underneath the violin scroll, the bow can scarcely be distinguished from the brownish pattern of the carpet. In this version, a stout recorder and a triangular keyboard instrument are the other objects we see. The X-ray picture shows that they were painted over a still-life. The bird-cage motif in the left-hand corner (barely visible on the photo) shows what unusual motifs Caravaggio liked to select - motifs similar to those preferred by Caravaggesque painters in the Netherlands.The St. Petersburg version, on the other hand, plays with the motifs of Caravaggio's other early arrangements of still-life and individual figures. Pieces of fruit lie on the marble slab, extremely brightly colored and brilliantly painted. A crystal vase contains a bunch of flowers, which would have made even Jan Bruegel the Elder jealous. The colors are applied uninhibitedly with a loaded brush - with a richness and precision we do not see elsewhere in Caravaggio's work."

10996-305david.jpg	Jacques-Louis David distinguished himself in France both as a painter and as a political figure, actively participating in the Revolution and later becoming Napoleon's court artist. After Napoleon's fall David went into exile in Brussels where he died.Although David made his name with large heroic narrative pictures on themes from antiquity, some of his finest works are portraits of contemporaries, in which he combines lifelike realism with the severe compositions, controlled colour range and unostentatious brushwork of the Neo-classical style. Jacobus Blauw is an especially fine example, and interestingly combines the painter's political and artistic concerns. The sitter was a leading Dutch patriot who, in 1795 or, as David dates the painting, year 4 of the French Revolutionary Calendar helped to establish the Batavian Republic. When the French army invaded the Netherlands later that year Blauw, along with his countryman Caspar Meyer, was sent to Paris to negotiate a peace settlement. It was then that they commissioned David to paint their portraits (the one of Meyer is in the Louvre). It is clear, however, that of the two it was Blauw whom David found more sympathetic.Blauw is shown seated writing an official document, a device which enables the artist to organise the composition with strict geometry, predominantly horizontal and vertical lines meeting at a right angle and echoing the shape of the canvas. (Or one can think of the sitter as forming a pyramid above the desk.) The fiction that Blauw has just turned from his work to pause for thought provides the motive for presenting him in full-face view. David softens the discomfort felt in such direct confrontation, however, by placing the head off-centre and by leaving the eyes unfocused. The pose combines great stability with a sense of momentary action, and seems to give us an insight into Blauw's character. He is shown in simple dress befitting a republican: a plain coat, a soft cravat, his own hair powdered, instead of an aristocrat's wig. A wonderful touch enlivens his brass buttons: gleams of red, implying unexplained reflections from the artist's studio, the viewer's space

32748-port_man.jpg	Although the young man's face is illuminated, his plain brown dress, dark, shoulder-length hair, and black cap merge with the background. Accordingly, the outline of his figure does not stand out incisively from the background but blends with it. Few Quattrocento paintings can match this portrait in terms of its formal austerity and limited palette. It was most likely made in Florence, where portraits with dark,atmospheric backgrounds had been appearing since the 1470s, largely owing to the influence of Netherlandish pictures such as Memling's portraits. Florentine examples are by Piero del Pollaiolo, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Sandro Botticelli. All examples show similar contrast between lit face and dark background.Documented altarpieces by Raffaellino are characterised by a repetition of artistic models rather than by originality. However, his distinctive synthesis of Filippino Lippi's eccentric manner of introducing movement into his compositions with elements of the staid, formal vocabulary of Perugino's Florentine works that accounts for the charm of his relatively small oeuvre

14724-willem3.jpg	In 1657, the Hanseatic town of Hasselt in the north of the province of Overijssel acquired a larger than life painting which still occupies its original place in Hasselt's late Gothic Town Hall. The scene it depicts is set indoors, but light pours in from the left, creating a number of vivid still-lifes. The represented scene is the last moment before the execution of a man. He is a bailiff, or magistrate, of a Dutch village, who purloined a cow, a peasant's most cherished possession.The peasant, seeking justice from a higher authority, had made a long journey to put his case before Count William III. The count summoned the bailiff, found him guilty of abusing the power vested in him and had him beheaded on the spot.Nothing is known about the artist but his name from the signature of this painting. No other paintings are known by him. However, experts consider this painting a masterpiece: the paint appears to have been applied with fluency and ease in clearly defined fields; the painter has captured the different textures of stone, velvet, lustrous satin, downy feathers and fur.There is an interesting, alternative suggestion for the attribution of the painting. According to it, the Hasselt burgomasters may have reached an agreement with the guild that a 'foreigner' itinerant painter, Abraham van der Planck was to paint, but not sign, the picture. Van Galen, who was from the town, would place his signature on the work instead

12478-07virgin.jpg	Mary and the Christ Child sitting in her lap appear to be right in the foreground of a space which opens to one side onto a bordering interior courtyard. The baby reaches for his mother's hand and their eyes meet. While the Madonna still owes much to the Late Gothic German type, the Christ Child is reminiscent of Italian models. Half length figures such as this early picture of the Madonna were widespread in Italy and the Netherlands. The depiction of the space with the view to the side through an arch is reminiscent of Flemish models, but the figural conception and monumental triangular composition of the group of figures also relates to Italy, in particular to the Madonna paintings by Giovanni Bellini. The picture dates either from D�rer's visit to Venice in 1494-5 or soon afterwards in Nuremberg. It was discovered in the 1950s in the Capuchin monastery of Bagnacavallo, near Ravenna, and this suggests that it was painted in Italy where it has remained

43548-s_antony.jpg	"This characteristic creation of Flemish mannerist painting was the centre panel of a triptych and originally decorated the St. Antony altar of the cathedral in Antwerp. In the background we can see several episodes from the lives of St. Antony the Hermit and St. Paul, such as their miraculous feeding by the raven, their conversation with an architect concerning the building of a monastery (which is also visible in the centre of a forest), the burial of St. Paul, and the kidnapping of St. Antony by demons.In the fifteenth century they often used the episode of St: Antony's temptation as the illustration for one of the four human temperaments, and in this they utilized their astrological theory. The pensiveness of the monk who withdrew from human society and dedicated himself to God is similar to the immersion into a state of melancholy. ""Thinking about matters which are not to be thought about and understanding things which do not exist"", so goes an eleventh-century Arab doctor's definition of melancholy (Constantinus Africanus Opera I, 287, Basel, 1536). At the same time, however, melancholy is a demonic state (""In Saturni parte sunt diabolici""), and this provides direct contact with the temptation scene.In this context, music appears on Satan's side as an instrument of temptation. The beautiful female figure wearing antlers and carrying a gold-filled box is escorted by fantastic figures. Among them we can see a couple dancing and two musicians dressed in a peculiar manner. Music, however, appears in the same picture in a positive role as well. The ceremony of St. Paul's burial is accompanied by singing and music-making animals who pay him their last respects in this way.This, however, is not the only example of the twofold interpretation of the symbols in the painting. It is a well-known fact that one of the attributes of St. Antony the Hermit is the swine, as - among others - he was the patron saint of domestic animals. The malady called St. Anthony's fire (herpes zoster) that ravaged Europe from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries, was cured with lard and the sick were cared for by Antonites in their own hospitals. In Martin de Vos's painting the swine-headed figure holding a book, who accompanies the Hermit, also plays a positive part. At the same time, however, the demonic female figure is also escorted by a swine, this time symbolizing temptation"

The unusual flowered curtaining and the customary three-quarter pose do not diminish the physiognomical impact of his face, which is actually accentuated by the meagre colour and by the far-away leftward gaze.In this painting Bellini gave St Dominic the specific features of an actual person, thereby blurring the boundaries between portrait and saintly image. The subject can be characterised either as Fra Teodoro in the guise of St Dominic or as St Dominic with the features of Fra Teodoro.This portrait is Giovanni Bellini's ""farewell"" of the genre, this last known portrait was painted more than four decades after the portrait of J�rg Fugger.

05477-70cestel.jpg	"The picture, commissioned in 1489, was painted for the church of the Florentine convent of Cestello (today Santa Maria Maddalena de'Pazzi) in Borgo Pinti.Botticelli enables the observer to look through a room structured according to the laws of perspective and across the red floor tiles, along its converging lines, out onto a landscape. The lively movement of the figures contrasts with these spatial dynamics, which lead towards the background. There is a diagonal line running from the edge of Gabriel's robes to his raised hand, and it continues in the arm which Mary is holding across her chest. The angel's robes, which are billowing in great folds, show that he has just made a sweeping landing. Gabriel is kneeling reverently in front of Mary and his mouth, which is slightly open, suggests that he is in the process of speaking the words of St. Luke's Gospel, which are written underneath him in Latin on the painting's original frame: ""The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee."

It was sent for exhibition from Rome.Delane worked in the classical manner of Claude Lorrain and many of his pictures were sold in London as Claude originals. This landscape idiom had been popularised by the Welsh-born painter Richard Wilson and Delane found many aristocratic clients in Rome who had developed a taste for such pictures.The painting of night scenes was popular amongst the immigre artistic community at Rome: Jacob More painted several, Joseph Wright, who painted numerous night scenes, and the Frenchman Volaire, who painted volcanoes by night. In these pictures, much approved by Goethe, and dating from the 1770's and 1780's, we may trace the onset and development of the Romantic movement.Delane had already visited the subject matter of Tivoli earlier in his stay in Rome, and had executed a set of four large canvases for Lord Charles Hope in 1763.

09467-corint02.jpg	This self-portrait is a variation on B�cklin's approach to the traditional memento mori theme. The two pictures, referring to a long lineage in portrayals of life's vanity, are thematically comparable, but the differences in approach are striking: where B�cklin uses colour nuances, and the proximity, facial expressions and gestures of the protagonists, seen against an undefinable background, to create a mysterious atmosphere, Corinth deliberately avoids all unclarity whatsoever. The skeleton on its hook is plainly an anatomical model. The painter is beside it, but no relation is established between him and the skeleton

10972-113david.jpg	David became a full Academician with Andromache Mourning Hector, which he presented on 23 August 1783, just in time for it to be shown at the Salon. The painting represents a scene from Homer's Iliad where Andromache grieves over the body of her husband Hector, who has been killed by Achilles in the Trojan War. The subject of a widow and a young child might have evoked personal memories for David; the fatherless Astyanax is shown trying to console his mother in the midst of her grief, and he appears to be about the same age as David was when his own father was killed

42151-lastsupp.jpg	In addition to Italian influences, the impact of northern painters, such as Marten de Vos and Maerten van Heemskerck, on painters in Seville at the end of the 16th century was important. The resulting hybrid of Italian and Flemish elements became the dominant mode of expression until well into the seventeenth century and is first observable in the work of Alonso V�zquez, who worked in Seville from 1588 until his departure for Mexico in 1603. His Last Supper, painted for the Carthusians of Santa Maria de las Cuevas, is a pastiche of poses and motifs borrowed from prints by or after Heemskerck, de Vos and Cornelis Cort. In fact the stylistic correspondence to the paintings by these northern late Mannerists is close enough to suggest that V�zquez had been able to study their works, perhaps in the collections of the resident Flemish community

19104-14buffoo.jpg	Hals's debt to the Utrecht Caravaggists is evident in his life-size genre pictures of musicians, drinkers, actors, and children of the 1620s and 1630s. But there are some significant differences. Hals was never fascinated by the experiments the Caravaggesque painters conducted with dramatic chiaroscuro effects produced by artificial light. The instantaneous expressions of his subjects never freeze into grimaces, and even when his models are dressed in costumes, he never creates the impression that they are posing in a studio; he always convinces us that we are watching a fleeting moment of life.

06187-02right3.jpg	"The most significant of the four scenes of the Dijon Altarpiece is that representing the Flight into Egypt. The Gospel according to St Matthew relates this episode in a few succinct words: ""And Joseph rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt."" With only this brief indication from the original text, painters have always had to draw on other sources in order to add flesh to their image.In the Dijon altarpiece, the Virgin is seen in profile, riding side-saddle on a small donkey. She holds the baby Jesus pressed to her cheek. He is wrapped in swaddling bands, and she has drawn her large cloak up around him. The child and his mother are looking at each other. St Joseph is leading the donkey by the halter, while he pours drink into his mouth from a small keg. He carries a stick over his left shoulder, from which his coat and a small pot with a ladle have been hung. He is wearing a hood and a surcoat held in by a leather belt at the waist. He has slipped his purse under the belt, and his leather boots seem to have been worn out by the long journey he has made on foot. He has a hooked nose, a curly beard and bushy eyebrows. The Holy Family have turned out of a sunken road running alongside a stream, and are about to climb a twisting path that leads away to the right across an arid mountainside. In the foreground, the water that wells up out of the rock is collected in a small rectangular basin, from which it pours out through a spout to low away freely once again. At the foot of the mountain stands a small statue of a warrior, armed with a lance. The statue has been broken in two, an allusion to the end of idolatry. A castle is perched high up on the peak of the mountain, well above the scene.The heads of the Virgin and Child, unlike that of Joseph, are both surrounded by a golden halo. Indeed, Joseph hardly corresponds to the conventional idea of a saint at all. Broederlam has portrayed him as a rough working man, a tired labourer weighed down by his heavy clothes. Some have even called him a tramp, and suggested that that it may not be water which he is slaking his thirst, but something stronger. Perhaps such stern jjudgments are themselves merely one reflection of the ambivalent cult that grew up around the figure of Joseph towards the end of the Middle Ages, for it was that time that he began to be openly caricatures, and depicted as a peasant who deserved to be ridiculed rather than revered. What really distinguished Broederlam's Joseph however is the fact that he is the only ordinary man in the whole altarpiece. He marks the first appearance in painting of an irremediably earthbound reality. From then on, from the Van Eyck brothers to Quentin Massys, this reality would be a constant theme of Flemish artists, even though their work was essentially religious in inspiration. Henceforth, there would be a continuous and growing emphasis on the physicality of the figures depicted, and the details of their appearance, as artist sought to capture their individuality by endowing them with a tangible presence. It is in this sense that Broederlam's Joseph signals the beginning of one of the most significant revolutions in the history of the visual arts"

13698-christ.jpg	The picture shows the rood screen of the church.In the Renaissance period the decoration of the church is frequently focused on the apse and the entrance wall. These terminal walls of extended interior spaces are visible from a great distance, catching visitors' attention. The decoration of the apse towers over the events of mass at the high altar; the decoration of the inside wall of the fa�ade serves as an admonition or reinforcement for the visitors as they leave the liturgical ceremony and the church. Large format in both places called for fundamental, weighty themes.Examples of large-scale painted apse recesses are common in the areas ruled by Venice but also in Emilia. A special form of decoration for end walls is found in Lombardy. Particularly in the monastery buildings of the Franciscan Observants, large rood screens cut across the nave of the church. These walls separate entirely the chancel area of the monks from the area of the lay brothers in front. The front of the wall, facing the space for the laity, would be used as a large surface for frescoes with scenes from the life and Passion of Christ. An early example is found in Santa Maria delle Grazie in Varallo. Gaudenzio Ferrari painted twenty-one episodes from the life of Christ in three registers, with the Crucifix in the centre emphasized by its size

41185-zhairy4.jpg	"Three small paintings in the collection of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tirol portray Pedro Gonzalez and his two oldest children. The ""hairy man from Munich"", as he is called, is considered the first documented case of the so-called ""Ambras Syndrome"", a congenital illness, which results in the growth of hair on the face as well as the entire body after birth. The fate of the hair-covered members of the Gonzalez family is noted for its reputation as a natural wonder. They were considered animals, who were both marvelled at and presented as gifts. Father and son, at least, turned their condition to a certain prestige and material advantage.Born around 1537 on the Canary Island, the hispanized and baptized Pedro was presented in his infancy as a gift to the French King, Henry II. The king arranged his marriage to Catherine who did not suffer from the syndrome. The portraits of the couple's two oldest children, Maddalena (born c. 1575) and Enrico (born c. 1580), who inherited their father's condition, are in the Archduke's collection"

44347-shooting.jpg	Frederick, Prince of Wales, is shown seated, wearing hunting livery with the ribbon and star of the Order of the Garter. Two loaders can be seen behind him at the right edge of the composition, while John Spencer (1708-46) stands on the left holding a partridge behind his back. He was the father of the 1st Earl Spencer and the favourite grandson of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, whom he succeeded as Ranger of Windsor Great Park in 1744. Horace Walpole remarked on Spencers early death in a letter of 20 June 1746 to Sir Horace Mann: Jack Spencer, old Marlborough's grandson and heir, is just dead, at the age of six or seven and thirty, and in possession of near &#163;30,000 a year, merely because he would not be abridged of those miserable blessings of an English subject, brandy, small-beer, and tobacco.' The Duke of Queensberry (1698-1778) quarrelled with George II and therefore, given the nature of Hanoverian politics, found favour with the king's son Frederick, Prince of Wales, becoming Gentleman of the Bedchamber (1733-51) and Captain-General of the Royal Company of Archers (1758-78). Later he served George III as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. He was the patron of the dramatist John Gay.Wootton was the foremost sporting artist, landscape and battle painter of early Georgian England. He was patronised not only by members of the Royal Family, but also by leading aristocratic families such as the Dukes of Beaufort, Devonshire, Newcastle and Bedford. Frederick, Prince of Wales, commissioned a number of hunting scenes from Wootton, and two battle scenes [The Siege of Lille and The Siege of Tournay] commemorating the Duke of Marlborough's campaigns during the War of the Spanish Succession (1689-1713); these were hung prominently in Leicester House. In addition, he acquired three important landscapes of the grounds of Park Place near Henley-on-Thames, an estate purchased by the Prince of Wales around 1738. Trained by the Dutch artist Jan Wyck, Wootton became an adroit painter of horses and dogs, but the landscapes in which he set his sporting scenes were influenced by Poussin, Gaspard Dughet and Claude. The style of Claude is apparent in The Shooting Party, especially in the treatment of the sky and the trees.The frame for the painting was made by Paul Petit (active about 1740-45) two years after it was delivered by the artist. The frame is handsomely decorated with hunting trophies and equipment. At the top a lion's head supports the Prince of Wales's coronet and feathers, while below on the base rail a hawk stands astride a dead bird. A dead snipe and duck lie on the upper cornice, while hounds' heads emerge from the scrolls at the comers

39465-05joseph.jpg	"Joseph was the elder son of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob and of Rachel. His numerous older brothers were strictly only half-brothers, being the sons of Leah or of handmaidens. The events of his romantic life story have been depicted continuously in Christian art from the 6th century onwards. The medieval Church saw the episodes of his life as a prefiguration of the life of Christ, and it is to this that he owes his important place in Christian art.When in Egypt as a slave, Potiphar, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites and made him steward of his household (Gen. 39:7-20). Potiphar's wife 'cast her eyes over him and said, ""Come and lie with me.""' He refused her though she continued to press him. One day when they were alone together she clutched his robes, pleading with him to make love to her. At this, Joseph fled so precipitately that he left his cloak at her hands. When Potiphar came home she avenged her humiliation by accusing Joseph of trying to violate her, using the cloak as evidence. Joseph was promptly thrown into prison."

04012-golden5.jpg	The paintings in the four compartments of the cross-ribbed vaulting supplement the subject matter of the walls but are subordinate to it. Here we see Bianca Pellegrini's progress through the realm of her beloved. She wears a pilgrim's cloak on top of a richly brocaded dress, a pilgrim's hat hanging on her back and she carries a staff and bundle. Larger than life and backed by a lapis lazuli sky patterned with small gold rays, she strides through a landscape conceived as a 360-degree panorama. In each compartment, directly above the pilgrim's head, there is a sun, originally in gleaming metal but now black, sending out further rays. Since Bianca's figure appears in each compartment, one has the impression that hers is an endless pilgrimage. In each of the vaulting scenes she is flanked by tiny castles left and right, all of which belonged to Pier Maria Rossi. Each castle, identified by name, stands atop a mountain peak, in the midst of a fertile landscape, or next to a river, and behind are the snow-covered peaks of the Apennines. The rivers and mountains are also labeled. This is the earliest geographic panorama in art history

40768-10icon.jpg	The icon of the Transfiguration creates a tremendous impression on its simplicity and clarity of composition, splendid drawing and bright coloration. On the mount are Christ in His glorious radiance and the Prophets Elijah and Moses conversing with him; below are apostles astonished by the miracle, Peter kneels in amazement and John and James fall dazzled by the light. The painter, illustrating the evangelical theme of Christ's miraculous transfiguration in the presence of his disciples, was, above all, an excellent colourist. On the light blue background and light ochre mountain he boldly laid thick, bright colours-green and red, yellow and brown, white, and dark to the point of blackness. Typical of none of the icon-painting schools, the icon of the Transfiguration with this light blue background can, owing to its artistic merits, rank among the finest examples of early Russian easel painting

39574-11padua0.jpg	The Scuola del Santo in Padua, the house where the brotherhood of St Anthony met, was on the edge of the square in front of the church in which the famous Franciscan saint was buried. In 1510-11 Titian worked alongside other painters to decorate two walls in the upper assembly room (Sala Capitolare) with frescoes depicting miracles from the saint's life. He painted three scenes from the Life of St Anthony of Padua: The Miracle of the Newborn Child, The Healing of the Wrathful Son, and The Miracle of the Jealous Husband. They are the first of Titian's works that can be definitely dated and that still exist in their entirety.The photo shows the entrance wall with two of Titian's fresco and the altar wall of the room

41388-10colom3.jpg	The three panels in the Brera painted by an anonymous follower of Giotto, representing scenes from the life of St Colomba, belonged to a triptych, probably executed for the old cathedral of Rimini, dedicated to St Colomba and demolished in 1815. According to a plausible theory that is not universally accepted by scholars, the panels belonged to a double-faced composition placed on the high altar of the cathedral. Other panels of this work are in the Mus�e Jacquemart-Andr�, Paris; the Galleria Sabauda, Turin; and the Friedenthal collection, Ingenheim.Freer and more animated, the composition of The Beheading of St Colomba is based on the repeating rhythms of the figures, the lances, the shields and the trees. The line of the hills is reflected in the frail body of the decapitated saint, which forms an elegant, undulating pattern

Her face, veiled with a band of gauze, her blond hair hanging down her back in long waves, even the corselet that only partly conceals her bosom - everything about her suggest not a repentant sinner, but a young woman rightly proud of her beauty.She is tenderly holding the vessel of ointment with which, as the text above reminds us, she anointed the feet of Jesus after moistening them with her tears and drying them with her hair.

38703-matthew.jpg	Terbrugghen was the most important member of the Dutch Utrecht school. He spent ten years in Italy as a young man and he probably met there Caravaggio who exerted a great influence on him. His extant works were executed in Utrecht after returning from Italy. Sometimes he repeated the subjects of Caravaggio, like in the Calling of St. Matthew.The relation to Caravaggio is unmistakable but it is not a slavish imitation. The life-size figures are half-length instead of full-length, and the large empty space in Caravaggio's version at S. Luigi, where the drama of Christ calling the tax-collector to his vocation echoes in the shadows above the figures, has been eliminated. The composition has also been reversed; Christ and his follower appear to the left as dark figures in the foreground. The main accent is on the brightly illuminated group on the right. Terbrugghen's original talent and old Netherlandish realism successfully merge here with Caravaggesque motifs and elements. The mercenary soldier pointing to the money on the table shows a profile which marks him as a descendant of types popularized by early sixteenth century Flemish artists, and the six gesticulating hands in the centre are also a survival of an older tradition.Terbrugghen's debt to Caravaggio is seen most clearly in the manner of illumination. The light enters in a broad beam, and as usual in Terbrugghen's work, from the left. However, the quality of the light is original; it is lighter, richer, and more atmospheric than Caravaggio's, which seldom has the brightness or softness of real daylight.

42725-view2.jpg	"The two Mediterranean views, ""Le Soir: A Mediterranean Harbour at Sunset with Fisherfolk and Merchants on a Quay"" and ""Clair de Lune: A Mediterranean Harbour by Moonlight with Fisherfolk by a Fire on the Shore, a Natural Arch Beyond"" were painted by Claude-Joseph Vernet in Rome in 1752, the period that is considered to be the pinnacle of the artist's long and successful career.Vernet made of the moonlit landscape a whole new genre in which the moonlight itself becomes the subject, and this would ultimately inspire the nineteenth-century Romantic painters"

43015-08barbar.jpg	Around 1560-61, Veronese was commissioned by Daniele Barbaro to provide the interior frescoes for Barbaro's Palladian villa in Maser. The artist and his client had probably been acquainted since the early 1550s. A dating of 1556 has been suggested, based on Barbaro's edition of Vitruvius published in 1556 and the two volumes of this edition lying on the table. However, in view of the rather more aged appearance of the subject, a dating to the first half of the 1560s looks preferable. The upended book in front of a globe depicts a small putto on the left pointing with a rod at a geometrical proportion drawing. As this figure appears in the corresponding illustration of the Vitruvius edition sideways on, slightly averted and also wholly without clothing, it might be presumed that it was Veronese himself who provided the drawing on which this illustration is based. Likewise, the volume on the table - the page open shows parts of the title page of the Dieci libri - alludes to the clerics real sphere of activity. Though he had been appointed Patriarch of Aquileia, he devoted himself mainly to humanistic studies and architectural theory. Veronese catches the physiognomy of the subject and his apparatus in paint with unusual precision. This was evidently a response to his client, whose interest lay in precision in his own field of activity

19189-62vestru.jpg	Hals's most penetrating characterizations date from the last decades of his life. With uncanny subtlety, he grasped the personalities of all types: the strong and the vulnerable, the pompous and the meek, the brutal and the tender. Though he found some sitters more congenial than others, the aged master never seems to have been bored with his job. During these years he was especially sympathetic to sitters of his own generation. The pictorial reserve of his last phase was particularly suitable for the portrayal of his peers, whose age and tastes made them shun the new vogue for the ostentatious. But we sense he could also be critical of them.He was, however, more devastating when appraising members of the younger generation who found themselves dissatisfied with their father's tastes, and began to imitate the manners and clothes of the French nobility. Yet the artist was able to satisfy the desire of young patrons for rich effects without losing his extraordinary sensitivity to tonal gradations as seen in his half-length of Jasper Schade, a patrician of Utrecht who later was representative of his province to the States-General.Hals's characterization of him, and his firm control of pictorial organization, convince us that as a young man his sitter was a vain, proud peacock, an impression confirmed by a contemporary report that he spent extravagant sums on his wardrobe. In a letter written in 1645 (almost certainly the date of Hals's portrait) his uncle admonished his son, then in Paris, not to run up tremendous bills with his tailors the way his cousin Jasper Schade had done. A subtle emphasis on verticality in the portrait contributes to Jasper's haughty air - not that an emphasis on vertical forms must needs express arrogance, but here it certainly does. His hat's upward turned brim and the straight arrangement of his long hair accent the length of the face of a man looking down at people below his station. And while thin, frail bodies may contain most noble spirits, this one hardly inspires confidence in its inner strength. As dazzling as Hals's appraisal of his sitter are the zigzag and angular brushstrokes that suggest the nervous dance of bright light on his grey taffeta jacket while creating an electrifying movement on the picture surface

39736-03organ.jpg	"The great Venetian master created several paintings depicting the nude Venus in the company of male musicians. Each of these works has multiple allegorical meanings. In this picture the connection between music and love can be sensed even more directly than in earlier astrological illustrations. Painters have characterized the children of Venus (that is, those who were born under the sign of Taurus the Bull or Libra the Scales) with scenes of love-making and other earthly pleasures: games, feasts, bathing, dancing, excursions, and especially music-playing. From the complex astrological series of the sixteenth century developed the picture type ""Venus with Musician"", then the amorous scenes and pastoral concerts which remained fashionable for another two hundred years.In Titian's painting the contact between the enamoured youth and the goddess reveals something else, too. The canvas is dominated by the reclining nude figure on the couch casually leaning on her elbow and personifying beauty with her full body and the vibrant liveliness of her skin. The organ-player has his back toward her, but he openly turns his head while playing and derives inspiration from the sight of such beauty. This is a clear presentation of the inspiration theme in which Venus fulfills the role of the Muse. Her demeanour is ceremonial and passive; she pays no attention to the musician while he - and this is similar in each variant - makes great effort to make eye contact. It appears as if he pays reverence to such physical beauty by playing his music.In addition, this painting can be considered the representation of Sight and Hearing. The active role of the glance and the importance of vision refer to the first sense, while the music-playing to the second. We can also assume that the stag running across the background became part of this picture in connection with Hearing, while the well, decorated with the figure of a faun holding an urn, is the well-spring of love."

05225-20right.jpg	The erotic dream of the garden of delights gives way to the nightmare reality of the right wing. It is Bosch's most violent vision of Hell. Buildings do not simply burn, they explode into the murky background, their fiery reflections turning the water below into blood. In the foreground a rabbit carries his bleeding victim on a pole, a motif found elsewhere in Bosch's Hell scenes, but this time the blood spurts forth from the belly as if propelled by gunpowder. The hunted-become-hunter well expresses the chaos of Hell, where the normal relationships of the world are turned upside down. This is even more dramatically conveyed in the innocuous everyday objects which have swollen to monstrous proportions and serve as instruments of torture; they are comparable to the oversized fruits and birds of the central panel. One nude figure is attached by devils to the neck of a lute; another is helplessly entangled in the strings of a harp, while a third soul has been stuffed down the neck of a great horn. On the frozen lake in the middle ground, a man balances uncertainly on an oversized skate, and heads straight for the hole in the ice before him, where a companion already struggles in the freezing water. Somewhat above, a group of victims have been thrust into a burning lantern which will consume them like moths, while on the opposite side, another soul dangles through the handle of a door key. Behind, a huge pair of ears advances like some infernal army tank, immolating its victims by means of a great knife.The focal point of Hell, occupying a position analogous to that of the Fountain of Life in the Eden wing, is the so-called Tree-Man, whose egg-shaped torso rests on a pair of rotting tree trunks that end in boats for shoes. His hind quarters have fallen away, revealing a hellish tavern scene within, while his head supports a large disc on which devils and their victims promenade around a large bagpipe. The face looks over one shoulder to regard, half wistfully, the dissolution of his own body. The meaning of this enigmatic, even tragic figure has yet to be explained satisfactorily, but Bosch never created another image that more successfully evoked the shifting, insubstantial quality of a dream.Much more solid, in contrast, is the bird-headed monster at lower right, who gobbles up the damned souls only to defecate them into a transparent chamber pot from which they plunge into a pit below. Other sins can be identified in the area around the pit. The slothful man is visited in his bed by demons, and the glutton is forced to disgorge his food, while the proud lady is compelled to admire her charms reflected in the backside of a devil. The knight brought down by a pack of hounds to the right of the Tree-Man is most likely guilty of the sin of Anger, and perhaps also of Sacrilege, for he clutches a chalice in one mailed fist. The tumultuous group at right suffers for the excesses associated with gambling and taverns.Lust is punished in the lower right-hand corner, where an amorous sow tries to persuade her companion to sign the legal document in his lap. Perhaps he is a monk, for the sow wears the headdress of a nun. An armoured monster waits near by with an inkwell dangling from his beak. Lust is also the subject of the oversized musical instruments and choral singing in the left foreground. The musical instruments themselves often possessed erotic connotations. The bagpipe also figured as an emblem of the male organ of generation, while to play the lute signified making love

39228-2emmaus.jpg	Tintoretto began his career as one of Titian's pupils and was later much influenced by Parmigianino and Michelangelo, but his own art, dramatic and animated, passionate and visionary, kept a highly individual note that was in many respects totally original.The Supper at Emmaus is considered by experts to have been painted in about 1540, when he was a young man. Unlike his paintings of the Last Supper - a frequent subject of his later years - this painting is a more balanced composition in the Renaissance style, with the figures arranged parallel to the picture plane. The figures are relatively large and statuesque, and there is not such effective use of contrasting light and shade or spatial arrangement as in the more mature works. It is primarily by means of gestures and vigorous poses that the painter conveys the dramatic and tense atmosphere inherent in the scene

09435-boylston.jpg	The woman who commissioned this portrait was already forty years old and, in her day, would have been considered an old maid - although, as a sister of the enormously wealthy Boston merchant Nicholas Boylston, she would undoubtedly have made a good match. Copley, an experienced portraitist, handled the task with panache. Without seeking to give this confident woman a look of youth that would have defied all credibility, he concentrates on her charming vitality She sits for the artist, dressed in a silken negligee. This is intimate garb indeed.In France, only the aristocracy had their portraits painted in such apparel. Yet it is the prerogative of the bourgeois Rebecca Boylston to adopt this dress as a sign of her confidence and imperturbable dignity. The thin fabric also gives Copley a chance to emphasize Rebecca's slender figure, showing her firm and youthful breasts beneath the satin sheen. At the same time, in the intelligent and slightly mocking gaze of her dark eyes, Copley suggests that this is a woman of experience. Six years later, Rebecca married a wealthy landowner who commissioned Copley to paint a second portrait of his beautiful wife.The fact that Copley did not portray his model in the stiffly prestigious setting of a salon, but in a park, further underlines the natural charm of this millionairess. There is nothing contrived or affected in the way she holds the little basket of rose blossoms in her hands; it is almost as though she had just picked the flowers in the famous gardens of the Boylston villa. The slightly cramped Rococo attitude of Copley's earlier paintings succumbs here to a new and distinctly American directness and spontaneity

22388-tabletop.jpg	This oil painting is a full-scale model for one of the numerous table tops fashioned from semiprecious stones in the Grand Ducal Workshops founded by Ferdinando I de' Medici in 1588.After a period under the employment of the Habsburg family in Vienna, Jacopo Ligozzi moved to Florence circa 1576 where, swiftly recognised for his exceptional talent, he was engaged by the Medici for the Grand-Ducal workshop.  The artist was hired primarily as a draftsman, documenting flora and fauna from the gardens and menageries of the Medici with extraordinary naturalism and detail. Following the death of Giorgio Vasari however, he became capomaestro of the studio, serving Francesco I, Ferdinando I, Cosimo II and Ferdinando II, and was involved in the decoration of the Tribuna, Loggia and the rooms that later became the Uffizi Gallery.

Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver.

19563-granida.jpg	"Van der Helst succeeded Rembrandt as the favourite portraitist of the city. Most of his patrons were wealthy members of the regent class, admirals, or military heroes. He painted also portraits in historical guise.Pastoral costumes were among the favourite historical guises. From the early 1620s, nobles in particular chose to be represented as the protagonists of Italian and Dutch pastoral plays. The ravishing portrait of Anna du Pire indicates the special resources of pastoral portraiture. Du Pire is wrapped in swath of red, blue, and white silk, bedecked with pearls and a red feather headdress. Her d�collet� leaves little to the imagination. A respectable woman could be represented in this way only for sound narrative reasons, and they are suggested by the bow and arrows and the shell filled with water. Viewers familiar with the famous play ""Granida"" (1615) by Pieter Cornelisz Hooft would have recognized these elements as references to its title heroine, a princess lost during the hunt who receives water from an adoring shepherd. The portrait indeed has a shepherd pendant of her husband, the painter himself, and the pair form a romantic marriage set.Although du Pire's identification with Granida justifies her attire, even for a pastoral portrait this painting teeters on the edge of proper representations of actual people. Because she was van der Helst's wife, probably only he and his intimates, acquainted with his innovative portraiture, had access to her portrait"

44776-brother.jpg	After producing a trial piece for the Hieronymite monastery at Guadalupe in 1638, Zurbar�n signed a contract on 2 March 1639, which obligated him to supply eight pictures for the sacristy, each portraying a noted brother of the order. These paintings remain in their original place and constitute the best surviving example of a series of monastic history painted in the seventeenth century.The spiritual achievements of the Guadalupe Hieronomytes are exemplified in the Vision of Brother Andr�s Salmer�n, in which Zurbar�n's art of immediacy attains a pinnacle of intensity and feeling. Set in an indeterminate space that is flooded with amber light, the scene is divided by swirling, cyclonic clouds which accompany the appearance of Christ. In the shallow foreground zone, a mystical encounter takes place between two towering figures. Christ, garbed in a bright pink robe, reaches out and gently touches the forehead of Brother Andr�s, who is posed in strict profile, hands clasped in a reverential attitude.

39295-3mark.jpg	In 1562 Tintoretto was commissioned by the Guardian Grande, Tommaso Rangone to complete the decoration of the School of St Mark. This work from the Sala Capitolare relates the episode in which the Christians of Alexandria, taking advantage of a sudden hurricane, take possession of the Michelangelesque body of the saint which was about to be burned by the pagans. The group in the foreground  (where Rangone himself is depicted bearing the head of the saint) stands out sculpturally from the vertiginous depth of the background created by the use of light and by the obsessive architectural sequence of arcades and mullioned windows which terminate in the phosphorescence of the construction outlined against a reddish sky heavy with clouds. Light assumes an elemental role in this phantasmagoric scene. A curiously prominent role is played by the dromedary that has escaped from his owner.Tintoretto inserted himself into the composition - at right, the bearded man behind the camel

14322-madonna.jpg	The works of the Bolognese School are perhaps the most lyrical and emotional of fifteenth-century Italian paintings. The adherents of the school, headed by Francesco Francia, tried above all to achieve a tender, poetic manner of expression and to evoke atmosphere. They were much less interested in revolutionary ways of representing nature than their colleagues of Florence, Ferrara or Padua, and in composing their works they were for the most part content to use traditional types and well-proven solutions.Francesco Francia began his career as a goldsmith and we can discern in his paintings the brilliant technique and dexterity of the craftsman. Working as a pupil of Francesco del Cossa in his native town of Bologna, he was especially admired for his representations of the Virgin in which a gentle and charming Mary is seen against a delicate, atmospheric landscape. His preference was for the Sacra Conversazione, showing the Virgin surrounded by a group of saints - a devout but static type of composition, devoid of narrative

28522-1vario05.jpg	"In 1869, Renoir and Monet produced a whole series scenes of modern life painted outdoors. Their subject was La Grenouill�re (literally ""frogpond""). Situated on the banks of the &#206;le de Croissy on the Seine near Paris (opposite Bougival), La Grenouill�re was an elegant establishment built on a barge and combining bathing cabins and a restaurant. It was reached by footbridges and a small island with a tree, from which one watched the bathers. The island forms the centrepiece of a pair of twin compositions by the two artists. Monet's is the more structured, while Renoir's is livelier, more tightly framed, and more picturesque.

24800-nativi_.jpg	"The Nativity is the most famous work of the Master (Robert Campin). It is unusual in that it juxtaposes on a single panel three distinct episodes from the life of Christ: the Nativity proper, the legend of the midwives, and the adoration of the shepherds.The child and his parents are shown on the threshold of a rather ramshackle wooden stable. The thatched roof has a hole in it and the walls are dilapidated, revealing the ox and the ass, who, untypically for such a composition, have turned their backs on the newborn infant, rather than drawing near to warm him with their breath. The Virgin is kneeling, her hands held out in a gesture of adoration and her eyes lowered. At her feet, the Christ Child lies on the bare earth, radiant with light.Joseph, who had been a figure of mockery throughout the Middle Ages and even as recently as Broederlam, is here presented as a venerable old man. He holds a candle in one hand, and with the other shelters its flame from the wind. In the foreground, on the right of the composition, are the two midwives who, according to an apocryphal Gospel, were summoned by Joseph in a moment of anxiety. Behind this first group, the upper part of a stable door has swung wide open to reveal the three shepherds, seemingly prevented from approaching any closer by awe and respect.Hovering above the scene are four angels. As if exempted from the laws of gravity, they sweep past borne on the wind. They are holding phylacteries, on one of which is written a message. It is addressed to one of the midwives, whose right hand is paralysed: ""Tangue puerum et sanabaris"" (""touch the child and you shall be healed""). As in the art of the Van Eyck brothers, Campin's painting is minutely detailed in its realism. Light is an important stylistic and symbolic element: the candle which St Joseph holds alight even though it is day reminds the viewer that Jesus was born during the night, and that darkness gave way suddenly to light, as the laws of nature were overturned.The most striking element in this Nativity, however, is certainly the extended landscape that spreads out behind the stable. Beyond the two midwives, a rutted track running beside a stream leads the eye deep into the picture space. The track is bordered by pollarded willows and tall trees with fine branches. A path joins the track and leads across a meadow surrounded by a wicker fence. A man and a woman are walking along the path; they are wearing capes and are accompanied by a peasant woman carrying a basket of eggs on her head. Further on is a large farmhouse, its yard surrounded by high walls, and beyond this again lies a village with its houses, a lake nestling between hills and a small farm with vineyards perched on a slope. To the left of these stands a town with many splendid buildings, above which a small castle sits perched on a rocky outcrop. It is winter, but the sun is still visible between two mountain peaks, its ray spreading out from the golden disk in a symbol of renewal and redemption."

07074-2diana.jpg	Painted at the commission of Urban VIII's nephew Taddeo Barberini, the two large canvases, The Massacre of the Niobids and The Hunt of Diana were recorded in 1648-49 as hanging in his residence in the Via dei Giubbonari. Later, between the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries, they were transferred to the Palazzo Barberini alle Quattro Fontane, where they were definitively recorded in 1817.On the basis of payments to Camassei recorded in the Barberini account books for the Hunt of Diana, the paintings can be dated to 1638-39. It was Cardinal Bentivoglio who originally introduced the artist to Prince Taddeo, who became the artist's patron and protector.Many of the details of Camassei's treatment of this rare subject derive from a famous precedent, the Hunt of Diana that Domenichino executed in 1617 for Scipione Borghese. Nevertheless on a stylistic level Camassei detaches himself from his model, working in a manner that clearly shows the influence of the Roman neo-Venetian trend of the 1630's.

14714-09fische.jpg	Johann Christian Fischer (1733-1800) was an outstanding musician. He was born in Germany at Freiburg-im-Breisgau and played for a time in the court band at Dresden before entering the service of Frederick the Great. On coming to London, where he is first recorded on 2 June 1768, he became a member of Queen Charlotte's Band and played regularly at court. His performance of Handel's fourth oboe concerto during the Handel Commemoration at Westminster Abbey in 1784 gave particular pleasure to George III. Regardless of such successes, he failed in 1786 to secure the post of Master of the King's Band. He collapsed in 1800 while playing in a concert at court and died shortly afterwards.Fischer was a composer and virtuoso oboist. His two-keyed oboe is visible on the harpsichord-cum-piano against which the musician leans. Fanny Burney praised the 'sweet-flowing, melting celestial notes of Fischer's hautboy,' but the Italian violinist Felice de' Giardini (1716-93) referred to Fischer's 'impudence of tone as no other instrument could contend with.' In the portrait on the chair behind Fischer is a violin, on which he was apparently also an accomplished performer although only in private. The harpsichord-cum-piano, made by Joseph Merlin who came to London from the Netherlands in 1760 and established a successful business in the production of pianofortes, presumably refers to his abilities as a composer, as no doubt do the piles of musical scores.This portrait of Johann Christian Fischer stands as testimony to Gainsborough's own love of music. The artist preferred the company of actors, artists, dramatists and musicians to that of politicians, writers or scholars, and was himself a talented amateur musician in addition to being a painter. Gainsborough once wrote to William Jackson: 'I'm sick of Portraits and wish very much to take my Viol da Gamba and walk off to some sweet Village when I can paint Landskips and enjoy the fag End of Life in quietness and ease.' Yet some of his finest portraits are of musicians and include, in addition to that of Fischer, the composer Karl Friedrich Abel (San Marino, Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery) and Johann Christian Bach (Bologna, Museo Civico, Bibliografico Musicale). These two portraits date from the late 1770s, whereas that of Johann Christian Fischer was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780.Gainsborough seems to have known Fischer while he was still living in Bath (Fischer moved permanently to London in 1774). As early as 1775 Fischer evinced an interest in the artist's elder daughter Mary (1748-1826), whom he married at St Ann's Church, Soho, on 21 February 1780. The wedding was agreed to reluctantly by Gainsborough, who, although he admired Fischer as a musician, perhaps hoped that his elder daughter might make a better marriage, and lodged doubts about the musician's character. He wrote to his sister on 23 February 1780: 'I can't say I have any reason to doubt the man's honesty or goodness of heart, as I never heard anyone speak anything amiss of him; and as to his oddities and temper, she must learn to like as she likes his person, for nothing can be altered now. I pray God she may be happy with him and have her health.' The marriage did not last and Mary gradually became insane. Whatever tensions Gainsborough might have been experiencing with regard to Fischer's relationship with his daughter, Gainsborough's portrait is masterly in its compositional sophistication, use of colour and sympathetic characterisation. It is clear, however, that the likeness has been painted over another portrait which will no doubt be revealed by X-ray. The portrait came into the Royal Collection indirectly. It appears to have been painted for Willoughby Bertie, 4th Earl of Abingdon (died 1799), a radical politician and a talented amateur musician, but was sold by his successor. Eventually it was acquired by Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, who in 1809 presented it to his brother, the Prince of Wales (later George IV). Both were admirers of Gainsborough's work

13235-stillif1.jpg	"In this unusual painting, the artist has represented an octagonal framed painting of a still-life with flowers within a rustic garland of fruit and flowers. The picture is a witty trompe-l'oeil that delights the viewer with its play on the idea of the ""imitation of nature"", an idea that in the 17th century constituted the very raison d'etre of still-life painting. In the well-known story of the ancient painter Zeuxis - whose painted grapes were so realistic that birds tried to eat them - the pictorial values of illusionism and naturalism were linked together from the very beginnings of the genre in classical antiquity. This painting was also probably directly inspired by the precedent of Zeuxis's grapes.The painting within the painting represents one of Espinosa's own small still-lifes.

21204-skatalin.jpg	Johann Lucas Kracker was born to a Viennese family of sculptors. He studied at the Academy, and was a follower of the influential painter Paul Troger. In the 1740s he moved to Moravia, and through the Premonstrensian Order he regularly worked on Hungarian commissions. In 1764, after completing the frescoes and the altar paintings of the Abbey of J�sz�, he offered his services to the Bishop of Eger, K�roly Esterh�zy, and shortly after that he moved to the lovely Hungarian town. His most important work from this period is the fresco of the library, showing the Council of Trent, which he finished in 1778.He painted a large number of altar paintings, the most important being the St. Catherine High Altar of the parish church of Egerbakta. He painted a colour study for this painting in 1775, which was later purchased by the Hungarian National Gallery. The composition of the picture, which is entitled The Dispute between St. Catherine of Alexandria and the Philosophers, closely follows that of Troger's work entitled Jesus at the Age of Twelve, with the glorious and radiating female figure at the centre. The use of warm colours, the vibrant brush-work, and the types of Eastern figures suggest a Venetian influence. The story of Catherine converting fifty philosophers and the Empress in the course of a religious dispute propagates the tenets of the Catholic Church

07541-34thomas.jpg	This picture seems to belong to the same group as the second St Matthew and the Angel and The Sacrifice of Isaac because the same model reappears as the apostle at the apex of this composition. Like the first St Matthew and the Angel this picture belonged to Vincenzo Giustiniani and then entered the Prussian royal collection. Fortunately it was kept in Potsdam and so it survived the last war intact. This is the most copied painting of Caravaggio, 22 copies from the 17th century are known.According to St John's Gospel, Thomas missed one of Christ's appearances to the Apostles after His resurrection. He therefore announced that, unless he could thrust his hand into Christ's side, he would not believe what he had been told. A week later Christ appeared, asked Thomas to reach out his hands to touch Him and said, 'Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.'This drama of disbelief seems to have touched Caravaggio personally. Few of his paintings are physically so shocking - his Thomas pushes curiosity to its limits before he will say, 'My Lord and my God.' The classical composition carefully unites the four heads in the quest for truth. Christ's head is largely in shadow, as He is the person who is the least knowable. He also has a beauty that had not been evident in the Mattei paintings of His arrest and appearance at Emmaus

While carrying Deianira across he attempted to ravish her. Hercules, already on the further bank, drew his bow and slew Nessus.This painting belongs to the cycle of Hercules, intended for the Duke of Mantua.

21452-z_winter.jpg	"Lancret received early instruction in engraving and drawing, then at the age of 17 became the assistant of the history painter Pierre Dulin in Paris. He was not very successful in this field and the hoped for Rome prize of the Academy was not forthcoming, so on entering the studio of Gillot, who had also been the master of Watteau, Lancret gave up history painting. Two landscapes secured him membership of the Academy in 1718. His pictures show from the very beginning the influence of Watteau, with whom he soon quarrelled. A renewed attempt at history painting failed in 1723/24. He now devoted himself to the pastoral idyll and ""fetes galantes"".

35601-04landsc.jpg	The painting is a companion scene to Winter (also in the Royal Collection), although it was only when both pictures were in the collection of Frederick, Prince of Wales, that they seem to have been treated as a pair.X-ray examination reveals that the priming on all the additional pieces of canvas is identical, but differs from that of the central section of this work. It appears that the design on the initial piece of canvas had not been fully resolved in all respects by the time the extra portions were added. The join on the left is on a line with the tall windswept trees, which seem to have been painted over the sky and therefore may be regarded as an adaptation of the original design, which most probably incorporated a clear view through to the horizon. On the right the design has been more radically changed as a result of the addition. A steep bank (still visible to the naked eye) originally closed the composition, but this was painted out so that the horizon could be extended in the upper half and a further group of farm buildings introduced in the middle distance. The addition along the lower edge allowed for the horse and cart in the immediate foreground. In effect, if the additions are discounted, the original composition remains an entity in its own right, but the changes alter the dynamics of the painting, placing greater emphasis on the peasants wending their way to market.The composition of Summer is distinguished. There is an emphasis on contrasting diagonals that reinforces the sense of movement begun by the figures in the foreground. The eye is plunged into the distance across a glorious landscape that is positively pantheistic in its celebration of nature (note the cow being mounted in the centre of the composition). Regardless of differences in scale and style, a telling comparison can be made between Summer and The Flemish Fair by Jan Brueghel the Elder. Interestingly, it has been suggested that the composition of Summer depends upon a lost painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder entitled On the Way to Market, only known today through an anonymous drawn copy in the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, Munich.

43362-port_man.jpg	The artist's signature and the date appear on the cartellino placed on the stone parapet. Behind the parapet a lifesize, middle-aged man wearing a blue vest is depicted. He wears a black hat that can barely be distinguished from the black background. While his body is angled, the subject's face and especially his gaze are directed toward the viewer. The dynamic effect generated by this torsion is underscored by the way the sitter grasps his robe with his left hand.Although the individual features of the sitter have been captured with utmost realism and in great detail, it has not been possible to identify him. His blue robe could indicate that he was a scholar or member of a confraternity.

33411-34newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 570.The Holy Family and other representations of the childhood of Christ occur frequently in Rembrandt's art during the 1640s. Domestic happiness and intimacy are their dominate mood.This representation at the Hermitage glows with human warmth; small details contribute to this effect. A burst of divine light accompanies the angels who invade the chamber to witness the scene from the everyday life of the Holy Family. The tenderness of the young mother's movement accords with the deep, warm colours, among which the cherry-red of her skirt is the strongest accent.

07500-271y_ran.jpg	This painting exists in two versions, both of which are probably by Caravaggio (who frequently copied his own paintings). Both versions are in Rome, the other in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.The image is a masterpiece of virtuosity whose appeal lies in its soft, caressing light and velvety rendering of cloth, flesh, and plants. The figure is identifiable as St John only virtue of the symbols of Christ displayed in the painting: the ram (sacrificial victim), and the grape-leaves (from whose red juice, akin to the blood of Christ, springs life); otherwise the iconographical subject (the simple, immediately apparent image) appears as a nude youth with an ironic, if not allusive, expression. Its cultivated content and its destination for an aristocratic patron are underscored by the artist's explicit use of a great figurative source of the past: Michelangelo's Ignudi from the Sistine Ceiling. But whereas Michelangelo created abstract and ideal figures with cold lights and a merely theoretical plasticism, Caravaggio models his figure on the careful observation of nature, achieving an image of perfect realism

17423-venus_ad.jpg	The story of Venus and Adonis is taken from the tenth book of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Venus, the goddess of love, becomes enamoured of the beautiful young huntsman, Adonis. Venus and the young Cupid try in vain to prevent Adonis from going hunting, as the goddess has had a premonition that the hunting party will have fatal consequences, and indeed the hunter is killed by a wild boar.Goltzius in this painting rendered the two lovers as heroic nudes, positioning them in the immediate foreground in almost symmetrical poses. They form a stable, pyramidal shape the inverse of which is established by the clump of trees behind them. In this painting and in other works from this period Goltzius shows a strong affinity to the style of Rubens

20379-17ingres.jpg	Ingres derived the idea of these swarming nudes in the interior of a harem from Lady Mary Wortley Montague's letters (No. XXVI and XLII). She was the wife of the English ambassador to the Sublime Porte; in these two letters she describes baths in the Seraglio, which she was allowed to enter, and Ingres copied extracts from them into his notebook (No. IX), probably in about 1817.Several of the figures in this canvas have been taken from earlier pictures; others are new. Ingres had not a very ready imagination, and borrowed from both French and English prints of 'turqueries', going back to the eighteenth or even the sixteenth centuries. Copies of these are still to be seen in the archives of his studio in the Mus�e de Montauban.This picture has existed in at least two forms. A first sketch, intended for Comte Demidoff, was executed in 1852, but not delivered; it was probably worked on again after this date, and at the end of 1859 it was bought by Prince Napoleon. The appearance of this picture, which at that time was square, is known from a photograph dated 7 October 1859. On the intervention of Princess Clotilde, scandalized by all those nudes, the Prince returned it to Ingres; M. Reiset was entrusted with negotiating its exchange for a portrait of the artist at the age of twenty-four (now in the Mus�e Cond�, Chantilly). Ingres kept the picture for several years, making various changes in it and giving it its final circular form. He signed it in 1862, indicating with pride that it was the work of a man of eighty-two

32148-the_farm.jpg	Potter's career was short. He died a few months after his twenty-eighth birthday. His early works show the influence of his father, the painter Pieter Symonsz Potter (c. 1595/1601-1652) and Moeyaert who painted cattle in his biblical and mythological pictures. He is documented as a pupil of Jacob de Wet, a Rembrandt follower, and probably also knew the innovative prints done in the thirties by Moeyaert, Gerrit Bleker (active c. 1625-56), and Pieter van Laer, which prominently feature cattle, horses, and other livestock; he himself made etchings of animals.Potter tried his hand at a few subject paintings, but the bulk of his work is devoted to horses and to scenes of cows, goats, sheep, and pigs, which show an extraordinary sensitivity to the various ways in which farmyard animals behave at different times of the day as well as to the different quality of light in the morning or at dusk in landscapes that almost invariably make country life appear idyllic.

07207-canal410.jpg	"Canaletto is not only the main representative of Venetian view painting but also one of the major exponents of the Enlightment mentality. There is  obviously an active rationalism behind his orderly approach to the laying out of this scene, with every object observed from reality but arranged in an almost numerical sequence. This reaction to Baroque irrationalism is part of the neoclassical movement popular in England, where in fact VCanaletto achieved great success.Canaletto's vision of reality is constructed on a perspective system, with a highly dynamical balance marked by a complex ""choral"" harmony. His art transcends mere documentary; he is the inventor of a seemingly scientific visualization in which the content of the scene reveals its true nature. The best proof that his are works of controlled imagination identified with reality is to observe the townscape of Venice after having scanned Canaletto's paintings. The city appears under a new guise, with striking forms and rhythms. The stage-set perspective that served Canaletto as a point of departure was fundamentally a means of showing illusionistically something that was not there. He reversed this process in his painting: instead of applying theoretical perspective to an object in order to simulate another, he rediscovered an object's natural perspective"

19887-5born.jpg	Fictive inscription on the stone parapet below the ledge: DERICHVS SI VOCEM ADDAS IPSISSIMVS HIC SIT/HVNC DVBITES PICTOR FECERIT AN GENITOR/DER BORN ETATIS SVAE 23. ANNO 1533 [Here is Derich himself: Add voice and you might doubt if the painter or his father created him. Der Born aged 23, the year 1533]Hans Holbein the Younger returned to England in 1532 for a second and longer visit, marked by a series of portraits of German merchants in London's Steelyard community. The group formed part of the powerful Hanseatic League and its members were for the most part only based in London for a few years. Holbein painted the portraits of several merchants, not, as might well be assumed, for the decoration of the Steelyard Merchants' Hall, but most probably for their families left behind in Germany. (The success of these portraits, however, led the Steelyard Merchants to commission the allegorical paintings The Triumph of Riches and The Triumph of Poverty for their Hall.) The portraits are restricted to half-length compositions and the sitters are normally posed in relation to a parapet or a table, looking directly out at the viewer and often identified by an inscription or some other internal clue. In this context the present inscription is of a type often found on portraits during the Renaissance. The wording might indicate an informal purpose for the painting. Although the exact number of the Steelyard portraits is not known, seven of the sitters can be firmly identified.When seen in sequence the paintings reveal the development of Holbein's portraiture during the early 1530s, from the meticulous treatment of the still-life objects in Portrait of George Gisze (Berlin, Gem&#228;ldegalerie) to the more restrained composition of the present portrait. Here the barrier formed by the parapet is negated by the placing of the head in relation to the angle of the shoulders and by the sitter's jutting elbow. These devices help to define the position of the figure both within the picture space and with regard to the viewer. They can also be found in early portraits by Titian such as the Portrait of a Man (also in the Royal Collection) and in the Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione by Raphael (Paris, Louvre). The precision of Holbein's brushwork incorporating the smooth modulation of the flesh tones, enhanced by the sharp light, the embroidery on the collar, and the foliage behind is remarkable. It has been suggested that the fig leaves behind the sitter in the present portrait are included for prophylactic reasons as opposed to being a personal symbol.Derich Born was from Cologne and his mercantile activities are recorded between 1533, when he may already have been in England, and 1549. In 1536 he is documented as a supplier of harnesses at the time of the suppression of the Pilgrimage of Grace. Together with his brother, Johannes, Born was expelled from the London Steelyard in 1541 and he seems frequently to have been in financial difficulties even though he continued trading.The portrait has the brand of Charles I on the back, but it seems not to have been recorded in any of the inventories of the Royal Collection until the reign of Charles II. It may, however, be identifiable with a portrait of Derich Born recorded in 1655 as being in the collection of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, a great admirer of Northern European painting. Charles I often gave paintings to Howard or exchanged pictures with him. This seems, therefore, to be a case of a picture having left the Royal Collection only to return later

13357-u6play.jpg	The Book of Revelation mentions that when angels and all creatures sang the praises of the Lamb of God, twenty-four elders bowed down before him (Revelation 5: 11-14). The twenty-four elders wearing white robes and gold crowns who take part in the Apocalypse are not present in this picture, but it is conceivable that the panel of the musical angels makes some hidden reference to them. The use of twenty-four strings instead of twenty-five on the harp may be interpreted in this manner. The other instruments also differ from those used in the period: the organ has twenty-one pipes instead of the usual fifteen, or three full octaves, which may be taken to symbolize the Holy Trinity, while the viol has five strings, not four or six, and this is in accord with the mysticism of numerology relating to the number five.

In this picture the thoughts of the artist are so prominent that the spectator is denied any form of visual pleasure, and it requires a great deal of mental effort to contemplate it. This painting is one of the few large-scale works of the master. It depicts the story of Pyramus and Thisbe as Ovid tells in Metamorphoses (4:55-166). The lovers , forbidden by their parents to marry, planned to meet in secret one night beside a spring. Thisbe arrived first but as she waited a lioness, fresh from a kill, came to quench its thirst, its jaws  dripping blood. Thisbe fled, in her haste dropping her cloak which the beast proceeded  to tear to shreds. When Pyramus arrived  and discovered the bloody garment he believed the worst. Blaming himself for his lover's supposed death he plunged his sword into his side. Thisbe returned to find her lover dying and so, taking his sword, threw herself upon it. This story became widely popular in post-Renaissance painting

At the death of Longhena in 1682 the palace was incomplete. The building was sold to the Rezzonico family who entrusted the construction to Giorgio Massari. The building was completed in 1756 with the decoration of the fa�ade, the stairway from the canal and the area to the rear with the airy large staircase leading to the huge ballroom.The palace contains significant fresco series. Giovanni Battista Crosato, working with the Lombard quadraturist Pietro Visconti, created the decoration for the grand ballroom c. 1753-56. In 1757, three different artists, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Jacopo Guarana, and Gaspare Diziani, were called upon to paint the ceilings of the four rooms on the first piano nobile overlooking the Rio di San Barbaba.

24843-triptyc1.jpg	This panel is the left wing of a portable triptych showing three scenes from the life of the Virgin: the Annunciation (top), the Nativity combined with the washing of the infant Christ and the Annunciation to the Shepherds (middle), and the Adoration of the Magi (bottom). The right wing (also in the Metropolitan Museum) depicts the Coronation of the Virgin and six saints. The saints - three males and three females - would have been chosen by the person for whom the triptych was painted. They are Sts John the Baptist, Stephen (or Lawrence), and Peter, and Sts Mary Magdalen, Catherine of Alexandria, and an unidentified female saint.

39748-13blindf.jpg	In old inventories, the figures in this painting are identified as either the Three Graces or Venus and two nymphs. In fact, the work depicts Venus blindfolding Cupid, the little god of love, and two nymphs who bring Cupid s bow and arrows. The painting evokes Cupid's blind power as his mother, the cosmic divinity, blindfolds him. His brother is intent on observing the large number of arrows or fatal darts of love (a metaphor for amorous glances) the nymph is carrying.This entire painting is covered by a unified golden red shade that is particularly apparent in the colour of the sky. The colour scheme is completed by an economical use of blues and greens. Titian decided not to use the powerful, impasto highlights that are such a frequent feature of his works during the 1550s. The painting, in spite of the potentially joyous mythological subject and similarly to other works executed in this period, is pervaded with a degree of tension which is clearly evident in the sad and pensive expressions and in the intense colours of the fiery sky.The rapid brush-strokes of Titian's mature pictorial technique when seen close to seem to break up the forms but from a distance they acquire an extraordinary modelled quality and create a chromatic texture that blends the background and figures in a `Venetian' harmony of colours. In the 17th century this style influenced Vel�zquez, Rubens, van Dyck and Caravaggio.
