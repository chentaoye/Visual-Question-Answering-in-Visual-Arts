10788-trinita.jpg	Daniele da Volterra and his workshop frescoed a tomb chapel for Lucrezia della Rovere in the Roman church of Santissima Trinit&#224; dei Monti. The Marian program of the decoration is tailored to the woman who commissioned it; the worries, plights, joys, achievements, and heavenly rewards of women are depicted. Each of the three walls is filled from floor to cornice with a single large narrative scene. On the side walls one finds painted balustrades below, from which steps seem to lead up out of the chapel to the stage on which the story takes place. The left balustrade, in front of the terrible scene of the Massacre of the Innocents, is closed; the one on the right, before the exemplary Presentation of the Virgin, is open. The chapel seems to have been transformed into a loggia, which on the altar wall continues into the depth of the painting. The real chapel is expanded into a fictive one, in which the apostles are standing around Mary's grave, and the Mother of God floats away to the Assumption amid a wreath of angels. In the foreground two apostles seem to be leaning out of the painting onto the actual altar of the chapel

38878-16udine.jpg	This is one of the two outer scenes on the ceiling of the Gallery.The fresco illustrates Jacob's dream of the ladder to heaven. The artist has moved the ladder, seen ascending into the divine light, from the centre of the picture slightly towards the left. The sleeping Jacob sees in his dream the vision of a divine prophecy, in which he is promised numerous descendants and safe arrival in the land of Canaan under the protection of God himself In form and content, Jacob represents the antithesis of Hagar and Ishmael (shown on the other outer scene), since his line leads directly to Christ.

21671-seguier.jpg	Le Brun must not be rejected as a mere decorator, even though so much of his other art is relatively inaccessible, deposited in provincial museums or surrounded in the Louvre by so much more exciting and exacting painting. There was no sense of his inferiority at the time - on the contrary, his art was highly esteemed by his contemporaries - and the ambivalent attitude towards him came about only in later centuries when the art of the period came to be assessed as history. Le Brun was in fact the most important painter in France in the second half of the century and the portrait of Chancellor S�guier (1588 - 1672) in the Louvre justifies a high estimation of his talent.The composition forms an enormous pyramid with the figure of S�guier at its apex. The scale is almost life-size, and the characterization of the sitters is worthy of Champaigne. Acknowledged as a masterpiece even though the name of Le Brun is forgotten, it is a unique record of an important official surrounded by his attendants. The date is uncertain, but it is likely to be from the 1650s

32332-turco2.jpg	The picture shows a detail of the wall decoration in the Salone Turco in the Palazzo Colonna. The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).Under the sons of Filippo II Colonna (1663-1714) more additions were made to the palace. A new wing was erected between 1730-33 by Nicola Michetti. Of this wing only the corner pavilion has survived unchanged, and in it is one of the loveliest interiors from the Roman Rococo, the Coffeehouse. The most important eighteenth-century additions were completed under Cardinal Girolamo II Colonna (1708-1763). He commissioned Paolo Posi to build a gallery in the highly theatrical style of the eighteenth century. The cardinal's favourite painter was Stefano Pozzi who, together with his brother Giuseppe (1723-1765) and the landscape painter Giovanni Angeloni (1740-1788), painted the doors, mirrors, and wall panels of Girolamo's apartment, the so-called Salone Turco, with cheerful and decorative arabesques and small-format scenes

14034-virginap.jpg	The theme of the Holy Virgin accompanied by angels appearing to the penitent St Jerome in the desert was interpreted by Fontebasso several times. The versions of Paris (Louvre), Vienna (Bossi Collection), Padua (Museo Civico) and London, as well as the two drawings in Bologna are similar to the Budapest picture, but for a different arrangement. The saint is seated in the foreground, leaning against his book, or praying and resting while his attention is held by the lion and his eyes are peering into the distance. In the Budapest picture he finally finds peace in death, lying on the matting with a cross on his breast.

36570-twomarys.jpg	The two memorable masterpieces, The Two Marys at the Tomb, and The Deposition (originally in the Capuchin church at Fontevivo, near Parma) give us cause to regret the brevity of Bartolomeo Schedoni's tormented artistic life. They show that he really would have been able to point Baroque painting in an original and intense direction. The way he blocked out gestures, used violent light and dazzling whites, combined with perfect clarity of detail to produce an almost metaphysical effect

06577-travel.jpg	Pieter Bruegel had two sons, Pieter the Younger and Jan the Elder, both of whom were painters. Both worked in Antwerp at the turn of the 16th century, but their work is so different from each other that they offer yet another example of the various movements which existed side by side at the time. A number of their father's paintings contain folklore elements which must have interested many collectors and prompted them to purchase such works. This would explain why Pieter the Younger copied or made variations on so many of them.Jan was a far more gifted artist. As was the case with his father, his many years in Italy had little influence on his down-to-earth Flemish art, but he lacked his father's broad, dramatic vision and expressive power. Building on his talent as a miniaturist, he confined himself mainly to small scenes, producing countless views of village streets, canals, resting places in the forest and so on. As in Travellers on the Way, he depicted a variety of human activities drawn from everyday life, with a sharp eye for the most minute details and a great feeling for the subtleties of fine technique. He was also the most important flower painter of his time, and the first to make a painting of a vase of flowers a genre in its own right

18868-william.jpg	"This canvas originated from the church of San Gregorio in Bologna and according to contemporaries it was a ""large splash"" of light and colour that completely overshadowed all the other paintings around it, including Lodovico Carracci's altarpiece. There is no doubt that this was the most important painting Guercino produced in his early years. He took great trouble preparing it and worked from careful studies and pencil sketches. The structure of the composition was highly original. The figures are arranged along the sides of an invisible lozenge, leaving the centre of the painting empty. The use of light and shade emphasized both the very delicate colours (right through to the candid white robes of the brother on the right) and the deeply dark areas. Thanks to this painting, Guercino became the favourite painter of Cardinal Ludovisi and leader of the Bologna school"

38231-banquet.jpg	Bernardo Strozzi the last of the three painters who revitalized Venetian painting at the beginning of the 17th century, came to Venice from Genoa in 1631. In his works the artistic language of Fetti and Liss is developed in a more decorative style influenced by Veronese, with a robust exuberance of colour reminiscent of Rubens. Strozzi's admiration for Veronese even before leaving Genoa is evident in Banquet at the house of Simon, clearly inspired by the works of the great painter, even if the exuberant style is now clearly Baroque.This is a late work that may have hung in the chapel of Palazzo Gorleri at Diano, Genoa. It combines the careful distribution of figures with attention to the functional details of the narrative. The architectural setting may hint at Veronese's banquet scenes.The banquet table is set diagonally in the wide niche. There are two focal points to the composition: Christ defending Mary Magdalene and Simon leaning incredulously over the table. A dense, rich colour, vibrant with atmospheric luminosity renders the figures physically and spiritually alive. The close observation of detail has a post-Caravaggio realism in the brilliant depiction of the servant interrupting the scuffle between a dog and a cat, or of the page bearing a tray of fruit, silhouetted against the sky

06681-v_lawye.jpg	This is one of the most popular compositions of Pieter Brueghel the Younger. In contrast with the majority of his compositions, it is not derived from one of his father's work, it probably has a French origin. Known in numerous versions, of which some twenty-five are considered autograph, the earliest dated version is from the year 1615.  Brueghel produced the composition in two sizes, the smaller format measuring approximately 55 by 87 cm, and the larger format, such as the present example, measuring approximately 76 by 123 cm. The overall design was done from a tracing and so remains largely the same in the various versions.  However, Brueghel modified his use of colour and tone from one work to another.

02525-9basket.jpg	This composite head, turned upside down, becomes a basket of fruit. When seen as a still-life this depiction of a fruit basket is an important early representative of this genre. It antedates the famous Basket of Fruit by Caravaggio, who might very well have known it. It also anticipates paintings of fruit still-life by Fede Galizia and Ambrogio Figino.The painting emerged on the market at an auction in Sweden in 1999. It comes probably from the collections of Rudolf II in Prague, because many works of art were stolen thence by Swedish troops during the sack of the Hrad�any in 1648

25099-1nichola.jpg	The saint sits frontally on a vaulted stone throne which stands in an open gallery. He is blessing the spectator. The handle of his staff is adorned with the images of St Lawrence (with the grid), St Mary Magdalene (vase) and St James the Less (fuller's club). On each side of the throne can be seen a piece of the arcade which opens out onto a landscape with the panorama of Bruges. From left to right we can recognize the towers of Our Lady's, St Saviour's, the Oosterlingenhuis (house of the German hanza), the belfry, the Poorters' Lodge, and to the right of the canopy the Jerusalem Church. Scholars in the 1950s made out the panel to be the centrepiece of a St Nicholas retable with fixed wings which each contained two scenes from the life of this saint on top of one another. In this manner it was possible to identify the enthroned bishop as St Nicholas. The scenes portray to the left the charity of St Nicholas and the miracle of the grain, and to the right the murder of the three children and their resurrection from the salt-tub.Donated as a Van Eyck, the central panel was very soon ascribed to the Master of the Legend of St Lucy. As with another series of panels by this master, as well as by his contemporary and fellow-citizen the Master of the Legend of St Ursula, a date has been suggested on the basis of the stage of building of the carefully portrayed Bruges belfry. Seeing that the octagonal crown with the wooden steeple was built between 1482 and 1486 and, after the fire of 1493, rebuilt from 1499 to 1502, a painting in which the belfry has this superstructure could have been made between 1486 and 1493 or after 1502. The former dating seems to be more probable.There is a remarkable similarity in composition and conception between the enthroned St Nicholas by the Lucy Master and the panel with Santo Domingo de Silos, painted between 1477 and 1477 for the church of that name in Daroca (Spain) by Bartolom� Bermejo (now Madrid, Museo del Prado). This Santo Domingo de Silos retable was also originally flanked by two horizontally split panels. It could be assumed that the St Nicholas altarpiece was a Spanish commission in which Bermejo's retable in Daroca was recommended as a model

00641-port_wom.jpg	Great dignity and extreme tenderness can be seen in this superb portrait of Woman with a Basket of Spindles. For a long time it was thought to be by Pontormo and only recently attributed to Andrea del Sarto. This is possibly one of the paintings that Andrea del Sarto began and his assistant Jacopo Pontormo finished. Typical of Andrea, in fact, are the slightly rotating planes, aimed at defining a compact mass in movement, totally remote from the harsh, almost neo-Gothic line which distinguishes the portrait-painting of Pontormo. The heavy use of chiaroscuro takes nothing away from the chromatic richness of the clothes whose soft drapery confers to the woman a classic monumentality

18382-1709grec.jpg	Hortensio F�lix Paravicino y Arteaga (1580-1633) was a Trinitarian friar who came to know El Greco during the painter's last years. His family was of Italian origin but he was born in Madrid. Already Professor of Rhetoric at the University of Salamanca at the age of twenty-one, he was a figure of great intellectual brilliance and authority in the Spain of Philip III and Philip IV. He was a prolific poet and renowned orator. Paravicino dedicated four sonnets to El Greco's memory in a volume of poems published in 1641. This included the oft-quoted lines: 'Crete gave him life, Toledo his brushes and a better homeland...' Another of the sonnets, celebrating the portrait, tells us that it was painted when poet was twenty-nine years of age.The complete frontality of the pose, the enormous simplicity, and the absence of any setting contribute to the feeling of spiritual presence, comparatively absent from the splendid portrait of Cardinal Guevara. The inspired rhythm and handling is no less a living thing than the man himself. It is one of the greatest masterpieces of portraiture and painting of all time

40106-denial.jpg	Tournier was the pupil of Valentin de Boulogne, a French Caravaggesque painter. He counteracted the Baroque use of light with a very personal and static way of handling figures with serene evenness of movement, a certain harmonius moderation in the relations between gesture, expression and sentiment, whose equilibrium, which might almost be called classical, is similar to the Gothic statuary.

09703-08holyfa.jpg	"This small painting of the Madonna by the great fresco artist and architect Cortona, founder of Roman High Baroque, may be regarded as the very epitome of a Baroque devotional picture. It shows the Holy Family resting on the flight to Egypt. Joseph is approaching in the background, while in the foreground an angel is offering fruit to refresh the child.Yet the expression ""devotional picture"" should be used with caution, for the question of specific types in this genre is still the subject of lively debate and much research remains to be conducted into the eras after the Middle Ages.Nevertheless, even at first glance, it is clear that the intimacy of Cortona's Madonna painting has more than just an aesthetic intention; it is meant to influence the mood of the spectator in a manner conducive to private prayer. The question of the devotional picture is somewhat complicated by Cortona's use of elements taken from the pagan vocabulary of early Roman Baroque - the idyllic, the pastoral, the antique bucolic landscape with its shady trees and wild wine - in keeping with the increasingly aesthetic interests of clients and buyers. Cortona's powers of synthesis are evident in the way he applies them successfully to create an ecclesiastical image of great atmosphere"

35466-05mythol.jpg	The subject of the painting is a legend according to which Leander, a youth of Abydos, a town on the Asian shore of the Hellespont, used to swim across the waters at night to Sestos on the opposite side to meet his lover Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite. She would guide him by holding up a lighted torch. One stormy night Leander was drowned. Hero in despair threw herself into the sea. The story is related in this form by the Greek poet Musaeus (4th-5th century A.D.). Ovid (Heroides, 18, 19) tells of the lovers, omitting their death. The theme is found in Italian and Netherlandish painting, especially of the 17th century which depicts Leander swimming the Hellespont towards a distant tower lighted by Hero; or the drowned Leander is borne away by Nereids as Hero plunges to her death into the sea

00616-06julian.jpg	Probably in 1453, Andrea moved to the church of Santissima Annunziata, where he painted two frescoes (St Julian and the Redeemer; The Holy Trinity, St Jerome and Two Saints) that are typical of his late style. No longer interested in the heroic and monumental characteristics illustrated in the Legnaia cycle, Andrea here imbues his figures with the crude truth that he had gradually mastered over a lifetime of hard work.The St Julian in the Cagliani family chapel in Santissima Annunziata is damaged in its lower section. The figure of the saint is no longer the sophisticated gentleman we saw in the Berlin Madonna: he is simply a young man who is sincerely contrite for the harm he has caused. Above his hair, rendered with golden highlights, the metallic halo realistically reflects the saint's head. Above Julian, partly concealed by pinkish clouds, Christ imparts his blessing. On either side of the saint, in the midst of a lovely Tuscan landscape, Andrea has illustrated some episodes from his life

00384-07cruci.jpg	Apart from D�rer, Cranach and Gr�newald, Altdorfer was the most significant German artist of the sixteenth century: a gifted painter, a graphic artist and the founder of the Danube School. He worked in Regensburg on the Danube, painting altarpieces and Biblical and historical scenes, and he was also the first landscape painter in the modern sense.The Crucifixion is a composition with numerous figures depicted against a golden background. This works illustrates very fully his fresh manner of representation and narration. Altdorfer painted several Crucifixions, but it is possible, on stylistic grounds, to date this version to around 1520. The symmetrical arrangement, with the cross in the centre of the composition, the crowd surging round it and the golden background (an unusual feature with Altdorfer) give the work a peculiarly archaic character. As in some of his engravings, the painter borrowed several of the figures and motifs from Mantegna.The painting was commissioned by Peter Maurer, Provost of Sankt Florian for his private chapel.

38912-02rapeeu.jpg	Giambattista Tiepolo very early withdrew from the lessons he was receiving from Gregorio Lazzarini, an academic of mediocre talents, and developed rather towards the vigorous chiaroscuro of Federico Bencovich and Piazzetta, render�ng their solutions still more refined and precious by using colours which have an absolutely unmistakable, densely fused luminous vibration to them. At the end of this fundamental experience come the canvas of The Rape of Europa in which the mythological subject is depicted in an airy, disenchanted transcription which at times becomes almost caricature. The severity of the pattern of chiaroscuro loses intensity in favour of refinement of chromatic notes in an interpretation of space open and articulated in depth which is as far from Bencovich and Piazzetta as it is consonant with the taste of Sebastiano Ricci. And the very lively spacial and luministic framework in which the figures take their places with such easy confidence offers a foretaste of the supreme gifts of Tiepolo as an 'organizer' of paintings

39254-08gigli1.jpg	Like its counterpart, the Evangelists Luke and Matthew, this painting can almost be described as brunaille (painting in brown on brown). Where the hem of St Mark's garment hangs down, it can be seen that Tintoretto left large areas of the dark ground as it was; he had to paint the picture and deliver it ready for installation within a very short time.These two paintings adorned the inner sides of two organ wings, and were therefore visible when the organ was being played. Tintoretto ingeniously refers to this by showing all four Evangelists turning as they sit on their clouds to listen to the organ.

04188-catherin.jpg	"This fresco is from the church of San Satiro, Milan. After its discovery in 1865, the fresco cycle to which this work belongs was detached and progressively moved to the Brera during the late nineteenth century. At one time, the signature and date, ""Ambrosius Bergognonis 1495,"" could be read below the figure of St. Catherine.The aristocratic appearance of this female figure is based entirely on the circling patterns of the robe, which builds up an ogee form embracing vibrant spatial rhythms.

The Marienburg family belonged to Deventer's ruling class. Willem Marienburg I and his son Willem II each held the office of burgomaster for a time. In the 1660s Terborch was commissioned to portray both generations with their respective wives as two pendant pairs. The oval portraits of Willem I (1590-1648) and his wife Geertruida Assink (1602-1679) are now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, while the portraits of Willem II (1634-1711) and his wife (and niece) Geertruid Marienburg (1645-1722) are in Prague.The pendants of Willem II and his wife exhibit the typical features of Terborch's elegant portrait style, which he cultivated in the 1660s, and which set his work apart from the established portrait types otherwise prevalent in the Netherlands

38559-archduke.jpg	David Teniers, court painter to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm Hapsburg, the Governor of Flanders, and keeper of his very fine collection of painting and sculpture, made several of these gallery portraits. The Archduke (in tall hat) is depicted showing to visitors the wealth of his pictures, most of them Venetian, almost half of them by Titian. Other Venetians represented are Giorgine, Antonello da Messina, Palma Vecchio, Tintoretto, Bassano and Veronese; also there are Mabuse, Holbein, Bernardo Strozzi, Guido Reni and Rubens. The sculpture supporting the table, representing Ganymede, is a bronze by Duquesnoy the Younger. Teniers himself is represented as the figure on the far left. It has been suggested that Vel�zquez borrowed the device of the half-open door at the back of this picture for his Las Meninas; at least Las Meninas can be understood as a similar picture, designed to illustrate the enlightened patronage of the patron and the corresponding pride of the court artist.The painting was presented to Philip IV of Spain by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm before 1653.

33902-17noremb.jpg	This painting is not included in the Bredius catalogue.Figures or scenes from the New Testament are relatively rare in the works of seventeenth-century Dutch painters. For Rembrandt, however, the Bible was an inexhaustible source of inspiration, providing with him innumerable examples of human joys and sorrows. He depicted his Biblical characters in the prosaic environment of ordinary Dutch people of his time, showing them as protagonists in the eternal human drama, moved by love, anxiety, wrath, treachery, humility or pride.This picture is a reference to the dream in which St Joseph was warned by an angel to flee into Egypt so that Jesus might escape the Massacre of the Innocents. The Holy family is shown resting in a dim stable; Mary is protected from the cold by a large shawl which she has also folded round the Infant on her lap so that only his tiny face is visible. Joseph, depicted as a clumsy Dutch peasant, is seen awakening from the sleep of exhaustion, dazed by a brilliant apparition which puts a hand on his shoulder as a sign of heavenly comfort, support and encouragement for the weak. The angel is the source of the warm golden light suffusing the whole group.This painting is one of more than 30 paintings formerly considered to have been authentic creations of Rembrandt made about 1650 that have since been degraded and left out from the Bredius catalogue. However, this painting has a powerful tie to Rembrandt - several authors thought it was the joint work of Rembrandt and a pupil - but the nature of that tie is not understood

17166-portra18.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 506, JH 1670.The portrait of the postman's wife, recently delivered of her third child, was planned in late 1888 but only completed, after some interruptions, in early 1889. The conception of the painting, originally one of the series of family portraits, changed as a result of Gauguin's visit in the autumn of 1888. In it van Gogh examined an alternative strategy for infusing a portrait with complex meanings. He gave the portrait a title, La Berceuse, which can mean both the woman who rocks the cradle and the lullaby she would sing beside it. Madame Roulin is represented primarily as the mother; she holds a crate rope between her hands.La Berceuse was a significant work for van Gogh. He painted five versions of it, one of which was taken by the sitter. He offered versions to Gauguin and Bernard and suggested a special setting for the painting, flanked by twin canvases of sunflowers whose brilliant yellow warmth was to underscore the feeling of gratitude which the painting was intended to convey.

He moved to the Proven�al town of Arles, where he remained for two years; it was a move from the city to a more rural environment, though Arles was a substantial, industrial town. But here, from his house on the place Lamartine, van Gogh could easily walk out into wheat fields nearby. The Yellow House on the square near the railway station on the outskirts of Arles was van Gogh's home and studio and he proudly painted this portrait of it in September 1888.

21159-stillif6.jpg	This painting is a result of the collaboration between Pieter Claesz. and Roelof Koets. Both painters signed the canvas. Koets painted the fruits and Claesz. the Roemers. The collaboration of two or more artists, specialists in different subject categories, were common in seventeenth-century Flanders. In Holland, such collaborations were less frequent, although it did occur. In Dutch still-life the joining forces of Pieter Claesz. and his fellow-townsman in Haarlem, Roelof Koets  is an example that stands out.The two painters were friends, living in Haarlem. They testified several times together as witnesses in lawsuits. They produced ten collaborative paintings, dating between 1644 and 1653. In these paintings Koets's hand can easily be distinguished: his sidelong lighting is more dramatic and more playful than that of Pieter Claesz., his foliage comes out stronger against a darker background, his oblong grapes are build up out of thin transparent layers

17817-801goya.jpg	This last ecclesiastical commission for an altarpiece for the Saint's chapel was received in May 1819 to be completed by the saint's day on 27 August. A sketch in Bayonne is said to have been in the Quinta del Sordo at Goya's death. Goya is alleged to have said that this would be his last painting in Madrid, as it virtually was, apart from the decorations of the Quinta and the Self-Portrait with Dr Arrieta.When the altarpiece was finished Goya wrote to the Rector returning most of the payment he had received saying: 'D. Francisco Goya has to do something in homage to his countryman', and a few days later he sent as a gift the small panel of The Agony in the Garden. These two paintings are outstanding in Goya's oeuvre for the intensity of the religious devotion they reflect. Goya may well have felt a personal involvement with the saint, who was not only a fellow Aragonese, canonized in Goya's lifetime (1767), but also the founder of the religious schools that are said to have given him his education in Saragossa. This large altarpiece with its highly charged dramatic subject is seen to its best advantage in the dimly-lit chapel for which it was painted

21964-5stjohn.jpg	"The Baptist, crowned with a laurel wreath, wearing a fur garment and carrying a staff, is with his left hand possibly pointing to a spring and holding a bunch of grapes. The fur and staff can be interpreted as attributes of the Baptist, and the fruit and laurel wreath as ones belonging to the classical god of wine. Given the poor state of preservation of the work, it is difficult to decide whether the laurel wreath and grapes were actually part of the original composition. There is at any rate a text that equates St John with Bacchus: the ""Ovide moralise"" by Pierre Bersuire, dating from the 14th century. A design for the painting shows the naked St John, though without the attributes of Bacchus. This painting was presumably produced by Francesco Melzi in Leonardo's workshop"

24939-bielefe1.jpg	This panel showing the Flagellation comes from a large dismantled retable probably made for the high altar of the former Kollegiatstift Sankt Maria und Sankt Georg, now the Neust&#228;dter Marienkirche in Bielefeld.One of the key monuments of late medieval painting in Westphalia, completed in 1400, the altarpiece was a triptych with folding wings about 6,56 maters wide when fully opened and about 2,18 meters high, including its lost frame. In the open state, it displayed a large central image of the Virgin and Child enthroned in the company of saints, flanked by thirty smaller scenes ranging from God Warns Adam about the Tree of Knowledge, through the life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion of Christ, to the Last Judgment, all on gold ground. The small scenes were arranged in three rows of ten, with the subjects progressing chronologically across each row, skipping over the Virgin and Child at centre, from the upper left to the lower right.The Flagellation scene was located at the far right of the middle row of the right wing. It shows the naked Christ bound to a column alluding to the praetorium (judgment hall) of Pontius Pilate where Christ was condemned to death.

40282-bellona.jpg	Bellona, a Roman war goddess, is variably known as the wife and sister of Mars, the Roman God of war, and in depicting her with Mars' children Romulus and Remus, Turchi has presented a classic Roman image of the highest order. Bellona is recognized by her typical attributes: a plumed helmet, metal breastplate, and spear. Rome's founders, Romulus and Remus, are immediately recognizable as they suckle the divine she-wolf that protects the infants after being cast away by their grandfather's brother, Amulius.Turchi utilizes an overall a Caravaggesque lighting scheme, with a strong use of chiaroscuro in which the single source of light washes over the composition from top left, creating deep shadows in the folds of Bellona's flowing drapery. This dramatic lighting contrasts with a colourful palette and classicising figures, both inspired by Annibale Carracci and Domenichino

21383-diana_en.jpg	In 1674 William IIIbought a country estate in Soestdijk. He built a hunting lodge on the property after the design by Maurits Post, the son of the celebrated architect Pieter Post. In the following years he commissioned paintings from Johannes Glauber, Melchior d'Hondecoeter, Gerard Lairesse and various other artists to decorate the walls. Most of these works were transferred later to the Rijksmuseum and the Mauritshuis. According to an inventory of the Huis Soestdijk in 1699, Lairesse painted six pictures for the decoration. Diana and Endymion was one of them, it was probably intended for the bedroom of the stadholder's wife, Mary Stuart. It was hung probably above e fireplace.The subject, Diana and Endymion, was a popular one. The story: Endymion, sent to sleep for ever by the command of Jupiter, in return for being granted perpetual youth, was visited nightly by the goddess Diana. The beautiful youth, Endymion, who fell into an eternal sleep, has captured the imagination of poets and artists as a symbol of the timelessness of beauty that is 'a joy forever'

04164-1pallav1.jpg	In the middle of the sixteenth century a unique series of palaces and villas were built in Genoa, by which the great families of the oligarchy that ruled the city displayed their status. The prototype for the new Genoese villas was that of Luca Giustiniani, designed in 1548 by Galeazzo Alessi. By 1556 Tobia Pallavicino had begun construction of his own villa. The so-called Peschiera was in an elevated setting in the middle of a luxurious garden directly in front of the gates of the city. The villa owes its fame not only to its architecture and location, but also to a particularly extensive decorative program of frescoes on the piano nobile.The walls of the Salone are decorated with a rich trompe-l'oeil architecture. The point of reference here is the Sala delle Prospettive that Peruzzi realised in the Villa Farnesina in Rome.Above the painted architectural vistas is a lavish ceiling decoration, in which five large history painting depict episodes from Homer's Odyssey. In variously divided and richly ornamented adiculae around the central image, are the five scenes, episodes from the story of Odysseus's return home, which was decided in the council of the gods:1.

21636-pius_vii.jpg	Pius VII (1742-1823) was the most famous Pope of the nineteenth century; he was also the most widely recognised man in that century, apart from Napoleon I. Born Luigi Barnaba Chiaramonti, he was elected Pope in 1800. Although he was present at Napoleon's coronation in Paris in 1801, Pius VII later excommunicated him and was captured by the French three years later and held at Fontainebleau until 1814. He is noted for his essentially passive resistance to the French emperor, epitomised by the Concordat of 1801 between France and the Papacy, but it was nonetheless a policy that was tenaciously and effectively pursued. After the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Pius VII was identified with the emerging nationalist movement in Italy - the Risorgimento - and the renewal of Catholicism in Europe. By concentrating on restoring the buildings of Rome and by consolidating the famous collections in the city so recently pillaged by Napoleon, Pius VII enabled Rome to become the spiritual and cultural capital of Europe.Lawrence was commissioned to paint the Pope by George IV, when still Prince Regent, as part of a series of portraits of those European heads of state, soldiers and diplomats associated with the downfall of Napoleon. The project was begun by Lawrence in 1814, but the twenty-five or so portraits preoccupied him for the rest of his life and, indeed, some remained unfinished at his death.Lawrence travelled extensively in Europe - to Aix-la- Chapelle, Vienna and Rome - in order to obtain sittings for the portraits. He was in Rome from May to December 1819, staying in the Quirinal Palace, and between 18 May and 21 September he painted Pius VII and his personal adviser, Ercole, Cardinal Consalvi.Pope Pius VII has every reason to be called Lawrence's masterpiece and it was recognised as such during the artist's lifetime. Lawrence wrote on 25 June 1819, 'No picture that I have painted has been more popular with the friends of its subject, and the public . . . and, according to my scale of ability, I have executed my intention: having given him that expression of unaffected benevolence and worth, which lights up his countenance with a freshness and spirit, entirely free (except in the characteristic paleness of his complexion) from that appearance of illness and decay that he generally has when enduring the fatigue of his public functions.'Pius VII is shown on the papal throne, or sedia gestatoria, on which he was carried in procession. His coat-of-arms with his motto PAX are visible on the finials of the throne. He holds a paper in his left hand marked Per/Anto. Canova, who was appointed Prefect of the Fine Arts in Rome by Pius VII and created Marchese d'lschia. In the background on the left is a view of the unfinished Braccio Nuovo, built to house some of the finest antiquities in the Vatican collections - the Apollo Belvedere, the Laoco�n and the Torso Belvedere are visible. The setting is, therefore, as important as the characterisation, but above all there is the sheer brilliance of Lawrence's sense of colour and brushwork, as, for example, in the depiction of the pope's hands or his slippers raised on the stool.The significance of this portrait of Pius VII is only fully grasped if it is appreciated that Lawrence was working in a well-established tradition extending from the portraits of Julius II by Raphael (London, National Gallery), Paul III by Titian (Naples, Capodimonte) and Innocent X by Vel�zquez (Rome, Doria Pamphilj). Lawrence was not overwhelmed by these inevitable comparisons and his achievement is such that he can be accorded a prominent place alongside these outstanding portrait painters

35484-22mythol.jpg	"Rubens returned to Antwerp in 1608 from Italy, and he brought with him an interest in the heritage of Antique art and literature that developed into a cornerstone of his thinking and artistic production. After setting up home in Antwerp, he devoted himself with unfailing interest to Greek and Roman mythology, which he used for the subject of many works, mostly as private commissions.The goddess of Diana was evidently of great importance to Rubens in around 1615, for she could be combined with another subject that interested him: the hunt. Moreover, this subject was well received by his royal and aristocratic patrons: game hunting was the exclusive preserve of the ruling class. Rubens produced a number of large format hunting scenes in 1614-15, many with mythological backdrop.Rather than emphasizing extremes of movement, as is typical of many of Rubens's hunting pictures, the Diana Returning from Hunt focuses instead on characterizing the powerful, beautiful and pensive huntress. Diana, simultaneously the goddess of chastity, stands with her companions before a group of satyrs, who belong to a quite different branch of Rubens's work: Bacchanalia. Diana's hunting spear divides the different worlds of the two groups And no less different than their appearance and natures are the spoils held by the satyrs on the one side, and Diana and her companions on the other. The fruit presented in richly laden baskets and the intoxicating wine, combined with the lecherous gazes of these half-naked figures, must be seen as an unambiguous sexual overture. Diana, guardian of female chastity, resists. The birds and the dead hare that she and her nymphs have bagged during the hunt reveal them as the conquerors of the pleasurable indulgence embodied by the friends of Bacchus.The animals and the fruits were painted by Frans Snyders.There is painting in Gem&#228;ldegalerie in Dresden almost identical to the one treasured in Belgrade. Among the differences is the size - the one in Belgrade is larger, and the slight difference in composition - on the Belgrade painting ""the frame"" is moved a bit to the right revealing the complete catch of the Diana companion"

13450-abraham.jpg	The subject of this painting was exceedingly popular in Rembrandt's circle and with Protestant collectors. Hagar, the Egyptian hand maiden of Sarah was the mother of Ishmael, Abraham's first son. When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ishmael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water near by, so they were both saved. Two scenes, the banishment, and the appearance of the angel are common in 17th century Italian and Dutch painting.Barent Fabritius's painting is in the manner of the Rembrandt school in the 1650s

11494-miracl8.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezieres, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them.Having passed from the influence of Bastiani and Antonello da Messina to a meditation on the works of Gentile Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio, Benedetto Diana was able, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, to absorb the influences of the most modern of painters working in Venice, of Lotto and Giorgione in particular. He showed a constant, natural predisposition for large-scale monumental compositions however and for the precise spacial geometry of late fifteenth century tradition. This inclination is also clearly displayed in the 'telero' painted for the Hostel Chamber of the Scuola di San Giovanni Evangelista. According to the 'Descrizione' of the Scuola published in 1787, the painting tells the story of how the four-year-old son of Alvise Finetti, 'scrivan alla Camera degli imprestidi' recovered after sustaining mortal injuries in a fall from the loft of his house. Especially evocative is the description of the interior courtyard of a fifteenth century Venetian palace reminiscent in its freely atmospheric style of Carpaccio

The action unfolds in a rectangular ruin divided in the middle by a double arch into a foreground and background space.Here too, the donor kneels on the far left behind a low wall. The stereometric planning and consistency with which Memling sets down his architectural features is characteristic. As in the Prado triptych, he locates the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi in the same building, but this time at a totally different angle and in another room, as if he had used a model that he could simply change around. In both paintings, the Child is born in the back room of the stable, with the ox and the ass. The stable of the Magi scene is shown from the rear in the left wing of the Floreins triptych. Every element tallies: the pilasters, the corbels, the beams, the little transverse roof and the hole in the thatching. The perspective of the left wing has two vanishing points with a viewpoint shifted to the right. That of the central panel is frontal, with a viewpoint moved slightly to the left, as is the case in the Columba altarpiece. Despite this, Memling placed the Virgin in the middle, directly in front of a column.His architectural interest is also apparent from the right wing. This Presentation in the Temple is set in the southern part of the crossing of the former Cathedral of St Donatian. The line-of-sight is directed towards the portal of the north transept, with the beginning of the ambulatory on the right. Bruges' Romanesque principal church would indeed have been an ideal choice for the part of the biblical Temple. Like the Prado triptych, the Adoration of the Magi is constructed symmetrically in the older Cologne style with the Virgin at its centre. Scholars rightly emphasised the heightened humanism of this scene, and its greater intimacy with the viewer in comparison to the Prado altarpiece. This Joseph is an affected witness to the Nativity, while the formal, prayerful pose of the Madrid Virgin and angels has given way to a joyful, hand-spreading gesture, expressive of surprise and wonder. The Christ Child in the Adoration of the Magi roguishly seeks eye contact with the viewer. One end of the eldest king's cloak is painted over the frame.The triptych is authenticated, dated and identified by an original inscription, on the original frame, and thus forms a key element (more so even than the St John altarpiece) in the reconstruction of Memling's oeuvre, and knowledge of his name and signature. The patron is Jan Floreins, also known as Van der Rijst, a member of the monastic community of Bruges' St John's Hospital. He is dressed in a black habit, and kneels behind a low wall of the ramshackle stable in Bethlehem reading a book, most likely the passage dealing with the Wise Men from the East in St Matthew's Gospel. The figure 36 (his age) is carved into the stone alongside his head. A youth in worldly costume stands behind him.Jan Floreins belonged to the de Silly family, who were known as the lords of Rijst thanks to an alliance with the Brabant Van der Rijst family. He was born in 1443, and joined the religious community of St John's Hospital in 1472, before becoming master in 1488. He apparently held that position until 1497, and probably died in 1504 or 1505. His initials and the arms of his family appear on the frame of the reverse of the wings. The presence of the youth behind Jan Floreins has not yet been explained.The myth of the sick Memling who portrayed himself wearing a patient's bonnet and peering through the window on the right of the central panel arose during the eighteenth century. The prophetess Anna who looks at the viewer in the right wing seems to be intended as a portrait. The boy on the far right of the central panel, next to the Moorish king, who looks directly at us, and who can have no iconographical function in that position, also appears to be a portrait.The Three Kings were invoked, amongst other things, against falling sickness and death without benefit of the last sacraments. They were also the protectors of pilgrims. Their portrayal was thus a natural theme for a hospital. St Veronica too was the protectress of those who died suddenly. The destination of the altarpiece is unknown, but Jan Floreins is likely to have installed it on a side altar of the hospital chapel. The detailed inscription with the donor's name is, after all, intended to be read by everyone

21638-spring.jpg	In 1908, the artists group Ash Can School (or The Eight) announced new bearings in 20th-century American art. Its members concentrated on the unappealing sides of modern urban life. Maurice Prendergast and Ernst Lawson tried to reconcile this subject-matter with a lyrical use of colour derived from Impressionism. Lawson brought a rough and ready brushwork to his urban scenes, the realism of which was in line with Ash Can precepts. He shared the group's taste for views of New York from the East, Harlem and the Hudson River he preferred landscape work to painting contemporary city life.Lawson used white for accentual highlights, and his compositions were generally fundamentally lyrical in tone, like in the present picture.

Laid out with a precise perspective, the room telescopes in well-marked boxes: the furthest, with St Joseph entering through an open court, is flooded with light; in the lofty foreground bedchamber, where Mary and the Child appear resting before an open window, the light is modulated in soft tones of brown and gray, giving it a simple cubistic appearance uncluttered by objects and details in bright local colour

05473-50bardi.jpg	"Botticelli painted one of his most impressive altar paintings, the Virgin and Child Enthroned between St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, known as the Bardi altarpiece, for Giovanni de' Bardi. Bardi, who came from Florence, was known as the ""great English merchant"" by his contemporaries; he had directed the London branch of the Medici bank for a long period and had made his money exporting wool. When Bardi returned to his native city from England in 1483, he built a chapel in Santo Spirito for his spiritual salvation. The altar top and paneling is still in the Bardi Chapel today, in a prominent location to the left of the choir. The altarpiece, in contrast, is now in the Berlin Gem&#228;ldegalerie; the original frame, produced by the wood carver and architect Giuliano da Sangallo, has been lost.Portrayed as the so-called Madonna lactans, the Virgin is baring her breast in order to feed her child. The client, Giovanni de' Bardi, chose the two saints John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, his patron saints, as intercessors. The Baptist, being the patron saint of Florence, was accorded the place of honour to the right of the Mother of God, and he is pointing the observer towards the Madonna and child. At his feet lies the instrument of his work, the baptismal bowl. The Evangelist to the left of Mary is an old man; he is holding a quill and book, and the eagle behind him is his evangelist's symbol.The composition of this Sacra Conversazione clearly shows his originality. Botticelli produced a different solution to the classical three-part structure of such paintings, showing the enthroned Madonna and Child flanked by saints, from that of his artistic colleagues. He did not simply use architectural elements to structure the picture surface, but mainly used naturalistically painted niches of foliage to form a deferential backdrop for the holy figures"

07200-canal402.jpg	The picture showing traditional Venetian ceremony is from a series of 14 views of the Grand Canal painted by Canaletto and engraved by Antonio Visentini (published in 1735).Venice's reputation as a city of festivities was amply justified. This painting, along with its companion picture (Return of the Bucentoro to the Molo on Ascension Day, also in the Royal Collection), record two of the most spectacular. Here a gondola race which formed part of a Regatta held on the Grand Canal is depicted. Such events had been organized since the fourteenth century as part of the Carnival, and were also occasionally arranged to honour notable visitors to the city.At the extreme left of the picture is the macchina (an ornate temporary structure) under which the winners of the races were presented with flags. It bears the coat of arms of Carlo Ruzzini who ruled as Doge of Venice from 1732 until 1735. Spectators fill boats along either side of the Grand Canal, and observe the race from the balconies of the palaces, many of which are decorated with hangings. The eight-oared barges have been specially decorated for the occasion, and a number of the figures, notably in the foreground, wear Carnival costumes, such as the tricorn hat with a white mask and black cape.An engraving of this work was included in Canaletto's Prospectus series of 1735. The composition was clearly popular &#151; other similarly accomplished versions of it are in the collections of Woburn Abbey and the National Gallery, London

23999-zeno03.jpg	"For the main altar of the Veronese church of San Zeno, Mantegna produced one of the finest and most influential altarpieces of the period. The altarpiece occupies a privileged position in the church, because the main altar area is raised above the level of the nave, and a special window was opened to increase the amount of light on the picture. The design of the elaborate gilt wood frame is probably based upon Donatello's high altar for the Paduan church dedicated to Saint Anthony, which, however, included bronze statues and reliefs rather than paintings. At the base are three large, nearly square predella scenes. These panels are copies, the originals were taken by Napoleon and are now in French museums.The painting is an early masterpiece of the young Mantegna. Although the basic format of the painting is essentially that of the late Gothic polyptychs it nevertheless breaks new grounds in the way this traditional scheme is handled. The stage upon which the holy gathering takes place is set against an ""open air"" background. The garlands suspended from the proscenium which appear to thread between the simulated columns of the painting and the actual wooden ones of the frame, dissolve the idea of the fourth wall of the traditional perspective box. The spacial games of this painting have come a long way from Brunelleschi's method of projecting the painted image onto an ideal plane. Perspective has now become a sophisticated means of achieving concrete reality"

34349-pond.jpg	Richet's best known landscapes are those set in the forest Fountainbleau where Richet depicts a figure on a tree-lined path or standing by a lake or pond. In these paintings we can very easily sense that, passionately inspired by Diaz's work, Richet strove to capture the profoundly agrarian aspect of nature, and that he sought to study the effects of light in much the same way the Impressionists would do only a few years later.

31742-05figure.jpg	For Pissarro the period around 1880 marked a caesura. After almost a decade, he took stock of what he had achieved so far and considered his own position in a new way. The Young Girl with a Walking Stick is one of the first compositions in which the painter places the figure centrally. It is also one of a series of paintings that show peasant women resting. Regarding the artistic technique, a change in the characteristic brushwork of the painter is evident. The canvas is covered with a multitude of increasingly minute dots of colour. This development heralded what is generally referred to as Pissarro's neo-Impressionist phase. He worked in this style from 1886 to 1890, encouraged by Seurat, the founder and theoretician of neo-Impressionism

34947-5oberze3.jpg	The church of St. Georg in Oberzell on Reichenau Island is the home of one of the few narrative picture cycles on the subject of Christ's miracles to have survived as a complete set from the Ottonian period. It was certainly painted by Byzantine-trained artists who continued their travels after completing their work in Oberzell.The continuous painted cycle running around the walls of the nave was designed from the very beginning as a narrative cycle. With a single exception, Jesus enters each scene from the left, thus establishing the direction of reading from left to right. The viewer entering the space will also start on the left side, the north wall. There we have the Gerasene demoniac, followed by the Healing of the Sick, the Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and the Healing of the Man who was Born Blind. The south wall contains the following scenes: the Healing of the Leper, the Raising of the Young Man, the Healing of the Woman of her Bloody Issue, the Raising of the Daughter of Jairus and the Raising of Lazarus from the Dead.The picture shows the second scene on the north wall: The Healing of the Sick. This scene includes a building on the right with a white wall made of ashlars. The same wall can be seen on the left-hand side of the adjoining scene, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, then suddenly stops. This is where the Sea of Galilee begins. Also visible is the boat which is soon to find itself in a storm. The white ashlar walls must therefore form part of the fortification of the city which reaches down to the harbour

26088-25more.jpg	Hans Memling came to symbolize late-medieval, mystical Bruges, not least because of the emergence in the nineteenth-century Gothic revival of a religious and nostalgic myth concerning his relationship with the city. A German by birth, who worked in Bruges from 1465 until his death in 1494, Memling belonged to the same generation as Van der Goes. In the aftermath of Van Eyck and Christus, he inspired a new generation of Bruges painters and invented a style that came to be regarded as characteristic of the city until well into the sixteenth century. Memling brought with him the aristocratic formal idiom and elegant arrangements of Van der Weyden, with whom he had undoubtedly collaborated in Brussels during his youth.The Groeninge Museum has an important Memling, the Moreel triptych, painted in 1484 for the prominent Bruges family Moreel. It was designed for an altar in Saint James' Church dedicated to Saints Maurus and Giles. The ethereal, paradisiacal space that encompasses the three panels, in which slim, well-proportioned figures - motionless and expressionless - participate in a sort of communal salvation, is characteristic of Memling's idealizing mode of expression. It is also one of the first occasions on which a complete family is portrayed and thus marks the birth of the group portrait. The central panel depicts Sts Christopher, Maurus and Giles. The donors and their children are shown kneeling in the wings, in a landscape that extends from the central panel. The man is protected by St William of Maleval, the woman by St Barbara. The couple are Willem Moreel (who died in 1501), a prominent Bruges politician, and his wife Barbara van Vlaenderberch, or van Hertsvelde (died 1499). Willem Moreel, lord of Oostcleyhem, was burgomaster in 1478 and 1483, bailiff in 1488 and municipal treasurer in 1489. He was also active for a time in the grocers' guild and as a banker for the Banco di Roma. The couple were granted permission in 1484 to set up an altar dedicated to St Maurus and St Giles at St James' Church, and to prepare their tomb nearby. The donors' resemblance to authenticated portraits of the same couple in Brussels, and the fact that the painting is dated 1484 and clearly portrays St Giles with a monk identifiable as St Maurus, a follower of St Benedict, demonstrates beyond doubt that this was once the Moreel family altarpiece in St James' Church, and that it was specifically produced for this purpose. The couple had five sons and thirteen daughters.The reverse side of the wings shows St John the Baptist (left wing) and St George (right wing).The triptych is shown in its original frame

25988-02last00.jpg	His almost obsessional concern for realistic detail did not prevent Memling from using allegory and symbol in his work. In one of his early works, the Last Judgment Triptych, the damned and the elect are linked together to form a garland of bodies, some tortured, some beatific, in descending and rising forms that span the entire composition. Christ is seated on a circular rainbow which separates the world above from the world below, his feet resting on a golden globe. To either side of his head are the lily of mercy and the blazing sword of justice.

24522-07clemen.jpg	The picture shows the scene Miracle of the Wheel on the lower register of the left-hand wall. This wall is divided into three tall rectangular panels, but presents five different episodes. Utilizing the middle distance and background as the settings for scenes that follow and are directly related to the events depicted in the foreground, the painter managed to integrate additional episodes into his pictures without compromising their formal integrity as compositions. In the scene of the Miracle of the Wheel an angel intervenes to stop the torture of the saint commanded by Maxentius. The secondary scene shows the emperor looking down at the interrupted martyrdom from a high loggia. A woman beside him, doubtless Empress Faustina, is leaning over the railing. She too had been converted by Catherine. The scenes of her conversion and her martyrdom are depicted in the lunette above.

39566-05judith.jpg	The Fondaco dei Tedeschi, which formed the headquarters of the German merchant community of Venice, occupies a prominent site on the Grand Canal, immediately next to the Rialto Bridge. The decoration of the principal, western fa�ade of the Fondaco was entrusted to Giorgione, while Titian was allocated the much less important fa�ade to the south, which looks on to a narrow street. Titian's frescoes, painted c. 1509, included trophies, children engaged in combat, and other images of struggle and warfare. The dominant image, placed directly above the entrance portal, was interpreted as a representation of Judith. It survives as a scarcely legible fragment, but its composition is recorded in an engraving by Jacopo Piccini

21478-allegory.jpg	"The painting was executed for the Marco Marazzuoli, a virtuoso musician who played the harp and also composed for the instrument. Known also as ""Marco dell'Arpa"" (""Marco of the Harp""), he was part of the extensive Barberini entourage of musicians. Marazzuoli was the friend and fellow countryman of Lanfranco, and Passeri links the fact that Lanfranco's daughter sang and played the harp to Marazzuoli's influence. In his will, the harpist bequeathed this painting to Cardinal Antonio Barberini, who had a keen interest in music. The connections between the papal family and the musicians and composers of the moment were fundamental. In the particular cultural climate of the Barberini circle, thematic comparisons were often drawn between the arts; for example between the iconography of paintings and the themes of operas. One can also connect the painting to the current of representation, in the various arts, of the 'affetti' and of amorous sentiment.The work is datable to the years between 1630 and Lanfranco's move to Naples in 1634. The elaborate harp depicted is based on an actual instrument: previously in the Barberini collection it can now be seen in Rome's Musical Instruments Museum (Museo degli Strumenti Musicali)."

24319-bertin1.jpg	Simon Marmion of Amiens played a significant role in French painting in the mid-fifteenth century. The composition representing the life of St Bertin was formerly part of the altarpiece of the monastery of St Omer.

04936-ladylucy.jpg	"Boltraffio was a pupil and collaborator of Leonardo in Milan and Leonardo's influence is clearly evident in this portrait of an unknown lady. The proportions of the face and the ideal of beauty which it reflects are very close to Leonardesque prototypes: the oval face, large nose, small mouth and large melancholy eyes. This influence is evident not just in the formal elements and the use of chiaroscuro, but also in the psychological penetration of the sitter's character, who seems to be stifling a smile (as do Leonardo's sitters). However, some features differentiate it from the older artist's work, such as the use of a harsher sfumato, which gives the bust a more sculptural character.The sitter clearly wished to be depicted as St Lucy, holding up the saint's attribute: a pin with an eye on the end. Portraits of this type, known as ""portraits in the holy manner"", remained customary until the Baroque, and were commissioned by young aristocratic women who wished to invoke their patron saints in order to follow their virtuous example. The sitter's piety is underlined here by the cross around her neck"

26150-37nogr1.jpg	International recognition of Memling's brilliance resulted around the end of 1480s in an important German commission, the last one recorded. The Passion triptych was painted on behalf of Heinrich Greverade or his brother Adolf (or both) for their chapel in L�beck Cathedral. Heinrich was a merchant who represented the interests of the Hansa from the Oosterlingenhuis in Bruges. His brother became the master of L�beck Cathedral in 1494. The donor shown in the altarpiece is probably Adolf, whose will made the foundation possible. For a variety of reasons, the chapel was not inaugurated until 1504, but the altarpiece dates from 149I and together with the Last Judgment, the St John altarpiece and the N�jera panels it is one of the biggest works painted by Memling.It is a triptych with double wings. When open the Carrying the Cross (left wing), the Crucifixion (central panel) and the Resurrection (right wing) can be seen. In its first closed position, the four saints to whom the altar was dedicated are visible across the full width of the triptych. The actual exterior, showing an Annunciation in grisaille, is only revealed when the wings are closed a second time. This structure was not customary in the Low Countries and was probably inspired by German, especially L�beck, examples.

The represented saints are: Alexander, Barbara, Roch, Dominic, Mark (at the left of the Madonna), and Catherine, Stephen, Augustine, John the Baptist, Sebastian (at the right).The San Bartolomeo Altarpiece, a Sacra Conversazione, the largest of Lotto's altarpieces, was commissioned by Alessandro Martinengo in 1513 for the monastery of Sts Stephen and Dominic at Bergamo. It remained in the church until 1560 when the church was demolished. It was transferred to the Convent of Basella, then four years later to the church of San Bernardino. Finally, it was placed to the choir of the Dominican church of San Bartolomeo. In the 18th century it was dismembered, the main panel remained in the church, the other parts are dispersed. Before being moved to the present church it included numerous minor elements (cymatium, predella and small panels set  in the columns of the frame) which are now to be found in various museums. The use of the architectonic scheme of the Virgin and saints is orthodox only in appearance. In fact many details introduce a vein of strong tension and undulating movement. It is interesting to note the rebus of words and objects held in the high by the angels, which was typical of Lotto's liking for enigmas

22260-manoffer.jpg	Although a number of works have been ascribed to Leyster since her rediscovery in the 1890s, the number attributable to her is small. Apart from a few Halsian portraits, a single still-life, and one or two watercolours of tulips, they are genre paintings. The earliest secure ones dated 1629 clearly show that from the start Frans Hals was a principal source of her themes and style. But Leyster did not work consistently in Frans Hals's style. In the early thirties she began to make pictures of 'modern figures' that have a communality with young Miense Molenaer's early works. They obviously had contact before their marriage; at this time they shared studio props and models. But more important for her than the early efforts of Molenaer were Dirk Hals's small daylight and night scenes in interiors. She learned as much from Dirk as from Frans Hals's motifs and style.An intriguing painting of these years that is closely related to Dirk in composition and technique offers a view of an old man displaying coins to a dramatically lit young woman sewing by lamplight. His hand resting on her shoulder suggests that he is not offering payment for her labour as a seamstress. Is he making a proposition for sex which she virtuously ignores? This interpretation has been offered, and with good reason. The theme had been used by northern artists since the Renaissance, and was not rare with the Caravaggisti. To be sure, Leyster's young woman has nothing in common with the readily seductable recipients of offers of purchased love depicted by earlier artists. Leyster's young woman steadfastly remains occupied with her sewing, a model of domestic virtue. If this reading of the subject is accepted, the painting can be viewed as Leyster's critical response to the salacious treatment of the subject by male artists who demean woman by representing them as sex objects exploited by men. It also would qualify the picture as Leyster's only painting that treats a feminist issue. However, it also has been argued that the painting is not a precursor of feminist ideology, but a depiction of a Dutch tradition of offering a woman coins as an invitation to court, a subject that is also unambiguously represented by Leyster's predecessors and contemporaries. Is Leyster's old man a dishonourable seducer or a respectable suitor? The interpretation is open to question

Taking the scientific method of the English physicist Sir Isaac Newton as his model and building on the epistemology of the English philosopher John Locke, Hume tried to describe how the mind works in acquiring what is called knowledge. He concluded that no theory of reality is possible; there can be no knowledge of anything beyond experience.

On the one hand this Christ is still associated with the master's first works, marked by a pathetic resentment that would soon disappear to leave space for the elevated ""classical"" melancholy; on the other, Bellini demonstrates his capacity to juxtapose the suggestions of Mantegna's style and those generically Paduan post-Donatello influences with a concept of light that is not only extraordinary but emphatically personal"

17809-713goya.jpg	After the expulsion of the Napoleonic armies in 1814 Goya applied for, and was granted, official financial aid in order 'to perpetuate with the brush the most notable and heroic actions or scenes of our glorious insurrection against the tyrant of Europe'. The two scenes that he recorded are not victorious battles but acts of anonymous heroism in the face of defeat. Here the people of Madrid armed with knives and rough weapons are seen attacking a group of mounted Egyptian soldiers (Mamelukes) and a cuirassier of the Imperial army. The composition, without a focal point or emphasis on any single action, creates a vivid impression of actuality, as if Goya had not only witnessed the scene (as he is alleged to have done) but had recorded it on the spot

41690-041annun.jpg	The anonymous Castilian painter who in the first half of the fifteenth century painted this Annunciation was probably more of a craftsman than an artist. Certainly he had not assimilated the pictorial innovations already evident in Italy and north of the Alps. The work reveals an independence in the treatment which calls to mind the way in which the peasant craftsmen of Eastern Europe freely adapted acknowledged styles to suit local tastes when they decorated some of the churches of the Carpathian Basin. This work owes a great deal to Gothic art, but the Castilian painter has given free rein to his love of ornamentation. The lack of perspective seems unimportant where there is such a decorative use of colour for the garments, and the vase with three lilies distracts us from the clumsy proportions of the figure of Mary

16620-triptych.jpg	Antonio Vivarini and his brother-in-law Giovanni d'Alemagna ran an extremely well-organized shop in Venice that specialized in multi-tiered, multi-paneled altarpieces and fanciful Gothic frames, which they subcontracted to various woodworkers. In 1446 they signed and dated this triptych representing the Madonna and Child with Saints for the wall behind the officers' bench of the recently expanded meeting room of the Scuola della Carit&#224; (now part of the Accademia painting gallery). Resembling an altarpiece but functioning as an inducement to good decision making, this monumental painting shows the four doctors of the Church (Sts Gregory and Jerome at the left, Ambrose and Augustine at the right) in a courtyard around a massive Madonna and Child.The Virgin's celestial court is vividly rendered with marbled pink and grey architecture, rich deep colours, costly robes, and lovingly observed plant life

29124-pantocra.jpg	"This large Pantocrator icon was doubtless painted for the Local Tier of an iconostasis, where it was affixed next to the Royal Door on the right.In the icon Christ is depicted as Pantocrator (Ruler of All), portrayed frontally, seated on a throne, majestic like a Byzantine emperor. The dark-blue tunic decorated with fine gold strips (assist) over a dark-red undergarment; together with the background, which is covered in gold leaf, are to be understood as signs of Christ's divinity: his glory and immateriality symbolize divine transcendence. Christ holds an open book of gospels in which words from St John's gospel (14:6) can be seen, in Greek: ""I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life ...""While the overwhelming majority of icons were created by anonymous masters, this one of the Pantocrator in majesty is signed and dated bottom right: ""1653. By the hand of Elias Moskos"". Elias Moskos originated from Rethymnon on Crete, and was one of the five most important Greek icon-painters of the 17th century. The battle for Crete between 1645 and 1669 and the final fall of the capital Candia (today's Herakleion) to the Turks forced many important painters into exile on the Ionian islands of Zakynthos, Corfu or Kefalonia. In 1646 Elias Moskos was one of those to settle on Zakynthos, where he lived and worked until his death on 26 January 1687. All his dated icons were painted either on Zakynthos or the neighbouring island of Kefalonia between 1649 and 1686. The one in Recklinghausen, dated 1653, is thus one of his early works. It is still in the tradition of Byzantine icon-painting, although most of his works were strongly influenced by Italian Mannerism"

34207-bandy.jpg	"Standing in a sweeping landscape, dressed in hatcbed brown clothes, barefoot and shouldering a crutch, his disability is evident: his deformed foot is at the centre of the spectator's field of vision. In his left band, this pitiable creature holds a note with the inscription: ""DA MIHI ELIMO/SINAM PROPTER/ AMOREM DEI"" (""Give me alms, for the love of God"").Described in this way, the painting would appear to be an image of misery, humiliation and begging. Yet what meets the eye, contradicts such an unequivocal statement. The boy whose face is aged beyond his years stands proud and upright againt the landscape in the background. He looks directly downwards at the spectator with a relaxed gaze of experience and superiority. The boy's mouth is opened in a relatively unattractive gummy grin that permits no patronizing sympathy. Ribera has created a monument to the justice of God. He shows up our hierarchical thinking, our worldly expectations of the gratitude of the poor, to whom we give alms. The apparently miserable, valueless individual stands here like a monument admonisbing us to remember that all creatures are equal before God. This boy is not begging for mercy.

39359-23bapti.jpg	The Baptism of Christ is on the side wall opposite to the entrance. In the painting the two protagonists are banished to the left and evoked by the beam of light that strikes the back of the kneeling Christ whose face is sunk in shadows. John the Baptist is also immersed in the shadow as he bends forward in the act of pouring the water from the river Jordan over the head of Christ.Around the two main actors a wide open space is created. It is bounded on the right in the foreground by a steep rocky wing in whose deep shadow some spectators of the scene are undressing under the glance of the devout brother absorbed in prayer. On the left however, in the background beyond the river Jordan, those waiting for baptism throng together in line. They are depicted in an extraordinary sparkling of blobs of colour and of luminous reflections. Evoked with astonishing rapidity of touch, the procession seems to extend on both sides, with no break in continuity, against the thick curtain of trees and under the blanket of heavy, threatening storm clouds. The clouds of the sudden storm are actually raining Eucharistic wafers. These are gathered up in every available receptacle, even in a blanket hung to keep off the no-longer-shining sun

18360-1511grec.jpg	Long thought to be a self-portrait by El Greco, this painting is now universally agreed to represent the painter's son, Jorge Manuel Theotokopoulos (1578-1631).Jorge Manuel appears about the same age as in the Virgin of Charity, painted 1603-05, that is, when he was twenty-five to twenty-seven years old. The young gentleman, of a certain aristocratic mien, displays elegantly the tools of his craft. It is one of his most splendid portraits, but it is with difficulty that one relates the personality to that of the Saint Luke. Jorge Manuel was not a remarkable painter like his father.Here El Greco depicts his son as an artist and at the same time as a member of the upper class. In the eyes of his Spanish contemporaries, an artist's palette and a ruff collar were still incompatible. By 1900, in contrast, artists were attending academies and the most successful among them enjoyed high social status

33384-07newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 539.In or about 1629 Rembrandt, painted this striking first version of this theme. Christ starts back in his chair, dramatically silhouetted against a blinding light as he makes himself known by the breaking of bread to the two disciples; in the next instant he will vanish out of their sight (St. Luke, Chapter XXIV, vv. 30-31).

32232-07assump.jpg	The authorship and the date of this painting were the subject of much discussion since the Poussin exhibition in Paris in 1960. It is now generally agreed that the painting is autograph painted in the first years of the 1630s. The most obvious pictorial sources of the composition would have been Annibale Carracci's Assumption of the Virgin (c. 1601); Domenichino's Glory of St Cecilia in the Polet Chapel, San Luigi dei Francesi, Rome (1612-15); and his own Assumption on the ceiling of Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome (1617). In each of these examples, the saint is carried aloft by angels and putti, but none is framed by architectural elements.In Poussin's painting the Virgin is unusually represented in profile.

22676-01stluke.jpg	Towards the end of his life Lippi had the opportunity to decorate the vast choir of Prato Cathedral with a fresco cycle treating the lives of Saint Stephen and Saint John the Baptist. By this time Lippi had married a former nun and settled in Prato, a town near Florence, where they had a son, Filippino, who became a painter. It took the artist many years to complete this commission, but it was obviously worth the effort. He appears in full maturity here, at a time when he could reach back to his early experiences to create a powerful series that falls into the distinguished tradition which can be traced from the Brancacci Chapel to Raphael's stanze in the Vatican Palace.Among the four Evangelists he painted in the vault, the longhaired Saint Luke seems like a youthful thinker with his head resting on his left hand and his elbow on his raised knee. This figure belongs to a sculptural tradition that can be found in the early quattrocento with Nanni di Banco and Donatello and is carried on in painting to Michelangelo's Sistine Prophets. Because of the great distance, Lippi was forced to put aside a certain amount of petty detail and abandon his sometimes idiosyncratic light for a more single-minded approach, in this his 'ultima maniera'

12566-2empero.jpg	D�rer's only commission for panel paintings from Nuremberg's city council was for a pair of portraits of the Emperors Charlemagne and Sigismund. These were ordered for the Treasure Chamber in the Schopper House, where the imperial regalia were kept the night before they went on ceremonial display on the Friday after Easter. For the rest of the year the regalia were housed in the Church of the Hospital of the Holy Ghost. D�rer was probably commissioned for the portraits in 1510 and received his final payment three years later. His panels are believed to have been ordered to replace two earlier works, now lost, which had been painted soon after the regalia were brought to Nuremberg in 1424.The half length pictures are larger than life. No likenesses are known of Charlemagne, who ruled from 800-14, and D�rer therefore invented his portrait, presenting him frontally in an imposing posture. His interpretation of Charlemagne's appearance was to influence depictions of the Emperor until well into the nineteenth century. For Sigismund, who ruled from 1410-37, D�rer must have had access to a portrait done during his reign.The two paintings include the appropriate coats of arms, the German eagle and French fleur-de-lis for Charlemagne and the arms of the five territories ruled by Sigismund, the German Empire, Bohemia, Old and New Hungary and Luxembourg. Inscriptions name the two men and state the number of years they ruled, 14 years for Charlemagne and 28 for Sigismund. Around the four sides of the panels are explanatory texts on the frames. The first records: `Charlemagne reigned for 14 years. He was the son of the Frankish King Pippin, and Roman Emperor. He made the Roman Empire subject to German rule. His crown and garments are put on public display annually in Nuremberg, together with other relics.' On the second panel is the text: `Emperor Sigismund ruled for 28 years. He was always well-disposed to the city of Nuremberg, bestowing upon it many special signs of his favour. In the year 1424, he brought here from Prague the relics that are shown every year.'Although the two panels were originally designed as a diptych, they were ultimately displayed separately. Other texts on the reverse of the panels suggest that the painted side was normally hung facing the wall, with the portraits only being shown on special occasions, presumably for the annual display of the regalia. The two panels were hung on either side of the shrine in which the relics were housed.D�rer prepared studies of the individual pieces of the regalia and reproduced them with great accuracy. Charlemagne wears the imperial crown and brandishes his sword and orb. Sigismund has a Gothic crown and holds a sceptre and orb. The annual display of the imperial regalia ended in 1525 and D�rer's panels were then moved to the city hall. Since 1880 they have been on loan to the Germanisches Museum in Nuremberg. As for the regalia, the Habsburgs later took them to Vienna where they remained in the imperial treasury, except for a brief period when they were seized by the Nazis and returned to Nuremberg

10823-stvaast1.jpg	The principal patron of Daret over a period of twenty years was the abbot of St Vaart, Jean de Clercq.Out of all of Daret's works that are recorded in Jean de Clercq's account books, only four panels have survived to the present day. They come from an Altarpiece of the Virgin (St Vaast Altarpiece) painted for the abbot between 1433 and 1435. Two of them, the Visitation and the Adoration of the Magi, are in the State Collections in Berlin; the third, the Nativity, is in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, and the fourth, the Presentation in the Temple, is in the Petit Palais museum, in Paris.One of these four panels, The Visitation is reminiscent in its composition of paintings by Rogier Van der Weyden on the same theme. But the three others are closer - strikingly close to the art of Robert Campin, especially the Nativity which should be compared with Campin's Nativity in Dijon. The two compositions are essentially analogous: the Virgin kneels before the Infant who is lying on the ground, while Joseph holds up a lighted candle. They also share the small group of angels and the scene of the two midwives taken from an apocryphal Gospel, which Daret treats as a separate episode. Daret is less inventive than Campin, and his ambition seems limited to creating a simple tranquil atmosphere. The clothes worn by the midwives are less exotic, and the angels are holding a single phylactery. Above all, Daret's Nativity has been substantially simplified: it has fewer characters, and materials and textures are rendered with less attention than in Campin's. One has only to look at the ageing skeleton of the stable to measure the distance that separates the two artists. Certain elements have also been modified, so that, for instance, the ass and the ox in Daret's picture face towards the scene of the Birth, rather than turning their backs on it.The other three panels show that Daret was a talented painter of the human figure and a sensitive landscape artist

19415-stillife.jpg	In this painting Heda took care to give the pewter jug a duller gloss than the silver vessels, and to make the lemon peel a brighter yellow than the soft ochre pie. This bring the still-life close to contemporary tonal landscape. There is another aspect (apart from the attempts to reduce the colours to a common denominator) and that is the curiously indeterminate space. The objects are put on a table, but the table is placed against a plain background which is strangely transparent with dull light. The still-life almost seems to float, like the mirage of trees on the still, reflective water in the river landscapes of Salomon van Ruysdael. Since the back-edge of the table is obscured from view, making a measurement of space is almost impossible.An occasional symbol may be slipped in the still-life.

It was sold via the city council to the king of Sweden. To get the painting to its new home, it was placed on a ship heading along the Swedish coast, where it had an unfortunate accident.

40265-organ_1.jpg	In 1469 the cover of the organ of the Cathedral in Ferrara was painted by Tura. The Annunciation was visible in the closed state of the organ, while in the open state the panel representing St George and the Dragon was shown. The cover of the organ was transferred to the Museum in 1735.The organ frontal for the Cathedral must serve as an introduction to the painter, although he was about thirty-nine years old when it was finished and obviously a fully formed painter. On one side was an Annunciation and on the other St George and the Princess, now shown on four separate canvases. These works were painted with tempera, although Tura seems frequently to have employed oils as well. They are emotionally charged, full of movement and intense expressionism. In the St George the frightened princess, placed close to the picture plane, moves swiftly to the left of the single canvas she occupies. Her fluttering, irregular draperies with decisive hills and valleys are carefully studied, but they do not follow the structure of her body or even her pose, becoming instead alive and rebelliously independent of the forms they hide

24774-1lady.jpg	The companion piece of a panel representing a man, also in the National Gallery in London.These pictures are among the earliest surviving examples of paired portraits. They belong to a group of unsigned and undocumented Netherlandish works attributed to a painter whom scholars have called the 'Mater of Fl�malle', after three panels thought to have come from that locality. Robert Campin was an artist recorded in the archives of Tournai, where he had numerous pupils, held civic office, got into trouble for leading a dissolute life and enjoyed the protection of the daughter of the Count of Holland. Most people now believe that he and the Master of Fl�malle are the same person. Under either name, the artist who portrayed these prosperous townspeople was a major painter.It is especially interesting to see how Campin/Fl�malle approached the task of depicting a married couple individually yet together. Although their glances do not meet, husband and wife turn towards each other. While the woman's face is smaller than the man's, and more brightly lit from the opposite direction to his, their features are aligned and the compositions appear subtly symmetrical. The symmetry is all the more pleasing and surprising for encompassing such obvious differences of gender, age, complexion, probable character, even colour and texture of head-dress. Nor does the pattern-making make the sitters look less lifelike. Because they take up more of the picture space than the figures of Van Eyck's bust-length portraits, and stand out more decisively from the background, they have a more assertive and potentially animated air

13940-rebellio.jpg	The Fall of the Rebellious Angels was the middle panel of a triptych that decorated the altar at the Fencers' guild in the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk in Antwerp (the Church of Our Lady). In the iconoclastic fury of 1566 the triptych was severely damaged and lost both of its side panels.Even at the time of its creation this altarpiece was already an object worth seeing. The way it was painted made Isaac Bullart, in 1682, think of a devilish brush rather than of a human hand. 19th-century writers who preferred the old tradition of Flemish painting were less enthusiastic about this work by Floris, whose inspiration lay in Italy.People eagerly sought exact copies of figures from Michelangelo's 'The Last Judgment' in this painting. It is clear that the fresco in the Sistine Chapel inspired Frans Floris but it did not tempt him to copy.The scene represented in the painting stems from Chapter 12 of the 'Revelation of Saint John, the Apocalypse'. Michael, the patron saint of the Fencers' guild, is fighting the dragon with seven heads, and the devils. The archangel and his helpers are attacking using the fencers' weapons, while the devils are defending themselves with knives, axes, pikes, bows and arrows and torches

26381-croton.jpg	This small, dynamic painting is a preparatory sketch for a large-scale work, now lost, that was exhibited by Meynier in the Salon of 1796.Milo (or Milon) of Croton was a legendary Greek wrestler from the Greek settlement of Croton in southern Italy. He won the wrestling contest at five successive Olympic Games, and swept the board at all other festivals. A man of huge stature, he boasted that no one had ever brought him to his knees. It is said that he carried a live ox upon his shoulders through the stadium at Olympia, then ate it all in a single day. Tradition has it that in his old age, on seeing an oak tree partly split open with a wedge he tried to wrench it apart, but only succeeded in causing the wedge to fall out, thereby trapping his hands. He was left a helpless prey to the wild beast who soon finished him off. He is usually depicted in Baroque art as a partly naked muscular figure, his hands imprisoned by a tree trunk, and attacked by a lion

03379-agliard2.jpg	Evaristo Baschenis was the leading still-life painter of seventeenth-century Italy. He loved the sensuous musical instruments of his day, whose satiny finishes and graceful curves he captured with striking virtuosity. The three canvases, Baschenis's masterpiece called the Agliardi Triptych, were executed for the artist's aristocratic patrons, Counts Ottavio, Bonifacio, and Alessandro Agliardi in Bergamo. The triptych includes portraits of the three brothers and a self-portrait of the artist playing instruments.The central picture of the triptych depicts a still-life with musical instruments: two lutes, cittern, mandola, guitar, spinet. Other represented objects are sheet music, sheets with lute tablatures, cabinet, bowl of apples, carnation, knife, pear. The extraordinary orthogonal of the two lutes and the mandola, leading toward the right, is contrasted in a refined play of crossed and converging diagonals with the sequence formed by the spinet, bowl of apples, and guitar

19665-fruit_ve.jpg	This colossal still-life is signed and dated 1630 by Claes (Nicolaes) van Heussen, a Haarlem specialist of the genre. Details regarding his life are sparse and only a handful of his works have been identified. They are variously signed (C.v. Heussen and C.V. Heus) and are dated between 1626 and 1631. He won enough local fame in his own day for Samuel Ampzing to make a passing reference to him in his history of Haarlem, published in 1628.To judge from his surviving works van Heussen was inspired by the huge, abundant displays of fruits and vegetables favoured by Flemish artists and by their followers in the Northern Netherlands. Apparently he did not attempt the unpretentious, monochromatic still-lifes that Pieter Claesz and Willem Claesz Heda were painting at this very time in Haarlem, today prized as Holland's unique contribution to the subject. Like so many exuberant Flemish still-life specialists, he felt compelled to animate his still-lifes with some live action and, as they often did, he called upon a figure painter to do the job. In this painting, Frans Hals painted the coquettish young woman who has turned momentarily to look at the viewer as she reaches into a basket

29854-charles5.jpg	The subject of this painting was the most famous ruler of the sixteenth century. The son of the Castilian King Philip of Burgundy and Mad Joanna, he ascended the Spanish throne in 1516. In 1519 he became Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and for nearly forty years was the leading figure in European politics. The Habsburg lip is already visible in this youthful and somewhat idealized portrait. In his later years the Emperor was also painted several times by Titian, for whom he sat in Augsburg. Bernaert van Orley, the master of this portrait, was court painter to the two women regents, Margaret of Austria and her successor, Mary of Hungary. Orley made a portrait of him in 1515, too, but this painting is known only from copies

03383-mus_inst.jpg	A number of musical instruments are placed in apparent disorder on a large table with carved legs, the top of which crosses the canvas horizontally. A dark green cloth placed loosely on it reveals to the left an open drawer from which a musical score hangs out. The falling fabric subtly breaks the strict symmetry of the table, producing the illusion of an attractive contour similar to the many found among the instruments. The diagonal light creates a mysterious chiaroscuro, completely effacing the extremely bare d�cor and highlighting the subject of the painting, in which a sensuously curved bass viol dominates. This instrument, back to us, is surrounded at both ends by two wood and ivory marquetry guitars. In the foreground we see, from left to right, a cittern, a mandola, and a small violin placed on its spine with its bow. In the background to the right are a lute and a flute. The scattered musical scores and a few soft-coloured ribbons provide some light touches to a mostly dark-toned composition.The warm, velvety precious materials of the objects are displayed with a rare mastery by the precise drawing, the raking light and the refined nuances of the brown, bronze and light yellow colours. Sobriety, reserve, harmony, rhythm and austerity govern the composition of this very noble composition. No decorative draperies, no superfluous details, but an expertly constructed picture in which volumes and planes are geometrically placed and which prefigures the still-lifes of the analytic Cubists. The instruments left lying, mute, at the end of a concert, and the presence to the right of two small decomposing apples, and the silence haunting the picture all evoke the precariousness and brevity of life. Here we have all the symbols of a Vanitas or a Memento mori.When the picture arrived in the museum in 1908, the nearly invisible signature was exposed. This marked the beginning of the rediscovery and recognition of the work of Evaristo Baschenis, who had been nearly totally forgotten over time. This Bergamo artist also painted a number of kitchen interiors decorated with fruit, vegetables and dead animals, but owes his reputation to his still-lifes composed of musical instruments, of which the present one is probably the most perfect.

38594-feast.jpg	The Flemish genre painter David Teniers the Younger had been painting peasant festivities since 1637, maintaining into the 1660s the tradition of Pieter Brueghel the Elder and his pictures of village weddings. The breadth of pictorial space in this painting indicates that it is one of his later works.Popular celebrations such as this served to channel and tame the latently rebellious energies of the peasantry. In sixteenth-century German and Netherlandish portrayals of rural merry-making, the viewer was not intended to identify with the celebrations but rather to become aware of his own social and moral superiority over the feckless peasants. With the advent of the new century, however, the function of the genre was to change, and Teniers here inclines toward a more amused and humorous depiction of country life.

33344-fortune.jpg	R�gnier is documented in Rome from 1620, when he is known to have been living with Dirk van Baburen and David de Haen in the district of Sant'Andrea della Valle, but he probably arrived in the city some years prior to that date. R�gnier's paintings from his Roman period are markedly Caravaggesque in subject matter and style. As well as being influenced by Bartolomeo Manfredi (as Valentin de Boulogne had also been) Regnier's works can also be closely associated with those of the Frenchman Simon Vouet, alongside whom he worked in Rome from 1622 (year in which Vouet returned to Rome from Genoa) to 1625 (year in which R�gnier left Rome for Venice).This strongly Caravaggesque painting was painted towards the end of R�gnier's Roman stay

08672-03peelin.jpg	Chardin's work contains, in every sense of the word, a moral: the importance of truth, the necessity for strict guidance of children, the dignity of labour. He never weakens his art by explicit statement of such things; they are the essential fibre out of which it grows, and everything we know suggests that they were his own beliefs. The public understood him instinctively and probably always preferred his genre scenes to his still-lives. His Salon appearances were - especially in the years before Greuze arrived - outstandingly successful.This is one of the four versions made by Chardin of this subject

44405-earthsto.jpg	Wright studied under Thomas Hudson in London. In 1771 he became a member of the Society of Art and in 1784 of the Royal Academy. A visit to Italy, 1773-1775, gave him the opportunity to study the old masters. Caravaggio and his followers seem to have fascinated him particularly as shown in his later work with its dramatic light contrasts. On his return to England he tried briefly to set up a portrait practice in Bath, but then went back to Derby where he remained. Although primarily a portraitist, he also worked on his discovery of the scientific genre painting. He developed an understanding of how to refine the effect of lighting in order to bring emotion into an apparently objective atmosphere. In landscapes, too, he was innovative in his use of light sources

The pronounced geometric forms of the side wall of Santa Maria Liberatrice, its placement parallel to the image surface, the use of shadows to unite and arrange the composition - all of these devices were commonly employed by Canaletto in his early works, and by Bellotto. Codazzi was one of the first Italian artists to adopt architectural perspective systematically in vedute. In this respect as well, this painting foreshadows the art of Carlevaris, Canaletto and Bellotto."

24787-2mero_c.jpg	This intimate triptych, which dates from about 1425, is traditionally known as the M�rode Altarpiece, after the family that owned it during the nineteenth century. It illustrates the moment when the archangel Gabriel announces to the Virgin Mary that she has been chosen by God to be the mother of Christ. The patrons of the painting gaze upon this miraculous event from one of the side panels, while Joseph, busy at his carpenter's bench, occupies the other wing. Campin's fascination with the natural and domestic world dominates his telling of the sacred story. He meticulously renders even the smallest details in an innovative technique combining translucent oil overlay on water-based opaque pigments. The resulting optical effects enhance Campin's interpretation of the Virgin's private chamber as an affluent fifteenth century interior filled with household appointments and goods similar to those that the patron would have known. Yet Campin was essentially guided in his choice of objects by the symbolic needs of the story. The brass laver, for example, signifies Mary's purity, as does the Madonna lily in the maiolica pitcher. As an object of private devotion, this painting would have been integrated into the furnishings of the owners' private quarters, where its hinged wings could be opened and closed according to the daily cadence of private prayers or following the traditions of the Christian calendar

24616-ugly_duc.jpg	"Massys is one of the most important portraitists of the age, thanks above all to his pictures of Erasmus and Pierre Gilles (Petrus Aegidius), the town clerk of Antwerp. His most astonishing work in this genre is certainly the Grotesque Old Woman, in the National Gallery in London. (This picture is also known as The Ugly Duchess, because Sir John Tenniel was later to use it in his illustrations for Alice in Wonderland.)Massys based his own picture on a caricature by Leonardo da Vinci. He was also influenced, according to Panofsky, by his friend Erasmus's book In Praise of Folly, in which the author describes old mad women who ""still play the coquette"", ""cannot tear themselves away from their mirrors"", and ""do not hesitate to exhibit their repulsive withered breasts'. The effects of the huge ears, wrinkles, and ape-like face, are merely emphasized by the ridiculous hat. The sitter is made even more repugnant by the rich jewels she wears and the indiscretion of her low-cut dress.

00633-harpies.jpg	"Perhaps the most famous work of Andrea del Sarto is the altarpiece painted for the nuns of San Francesco dei Macci, known as the Madonna of the Harpies.According to the contract signed on May 14, 1515 the picture was to depict the Madonna and Child crowned by two angels and flanked by St John the Evangelist and St Bonaventure, and to be delivered within a year. But in fact the work is dated 1517, and shows St John the Evangelist and St Francis on either side of the Madonna and Child on a high polygonal pedestal. The latter is decorated at the corners with monster-like figures (the so-called Harpies), while in the centre, beneath the artist's signature, are the opening words of a hymn to Our Lady of the Assumption. We therefore have not the Coronation of the Virgin but the Virgin of the Assumption.These variations on the original commission, and the subject itself, which is not a traditional Madonna and Child Enthroned between Two Saints, but a highly unusual presentation of the Virgin, full-figure on that enigmatic pedestal with the images of the ""harpies,"" have led to a lot of thought and attempted explanations on the part of all critics. The most recent interpretation is that it is a depiction, based on the text of the Book of Revelations, of the Virgin triumphant over evil, symbolized by the monstrous figures, the ""harpies,"" which are in fact the ""locusts"" mentioned in Revelations; and besides that, bears witness to the cult of the Virgin by the clients, the conventual Franciscans.Having removed the layers of dirt and overpainting, the 1984 restoration has re-established the exceptionally rich colouring of the work, praised by Vasari as being ""of singular and truly rare beauty."" The figure of the Madonna, wrought into a composed chiasmus in order to balance the weight of the Child (who on the other hand is lively, smiling, and as ambiguous as Rosso's putti), lights up the centre of the picture with the intense rose-colour of her robe tempered by harmony with the pale blue of her mantle, and with the brilliant yellow of the light fabric draped over her shoulders beneath the beautiful drapery of the white veil covering her head. On her left is the sculptural St John (painted from a terracotta model by Sansovino) swathed in a cinnabar red mantle linked to the lilac of his robe by means of a highly refined drapery, while on the other side the figure of St Francis strikes a clear note that emerges by subtle varieties of tone from the architectural motif of the background; while in the background one can once more see ""the smoke of transparent clouds veiling the architecture and the figures, that appear to move"" (Vasari): a warm, mysterious halo, made of colours and of shadows, that behind and around the figures impels an atmosphere that implies the rich spiritual message brought to us by this painting.The Madonna of the Harpies is truly a milestone in the career of Andrea del Sarto, and bears witness to the level of maturity of the most significant artistic experiences of the early 16th century: the ""atmospheric"" painting of Leonardo, the meditation recently infused with a new freshness in the ""grandiose"" manner of Michelangelo, the elegant and solemn classicism of Fra Bartolomeo endowed with a new intensity of colour after his stay in Venice, the experience of Raphael's work in Rome (and in this case the Sistine Madonna is usually mentioned); these are all motifs that come together in a single stylistic solution, the greatness of which was immediately recognized in Florence and elsewhere. This general admiration was shared almost two centuries later by Prince Ferdinando de' Medici, who acquired the picture for his collection in Palazzo Pitti, offering the nuns in exchange for it not only a copy of the picture done by Francesco Petrucci, but also the embellishment, and practically the remodeling and restoration of all the decoration of their church by Foggini"

16729-allegory.jpg	The subject refers to the English Reformation, formally sanctioned by the Act of Supremacy of 1534, whereby Henry VIII broke away from the Church of Rome and was established as head of the Church of England. The painting was in the collection of Henry VIII who owned at least two other anti-papal pictures. The composition comprises a pope sprawling on the ground, flanked by two female figures representing avarice and hypocrisy, all of whom are being stoned by the four evangelists. On the ground in front of these figures are a cardinal's hat and a document with four seals (probably a Papal Bull). The city in the distance on the left may be Jerusalem. Above the city is a burning candle, which contrasts with another in the immediate foreground that has been extinguished by a cooking pan. These candles have been interpreted as symbolising respectively the true light of the Gospels and the false doctrine of Rome. Historically, the pope should be Paul III (1534-49), but the depicted likeness is closer to Julius II (1503-13). A specific identification may not have been intended.The painting has been executed in grisaille with highlights in gold. The composition bears a striking resemblance to three identical woodcuts illustrating scenes of stoning in the Coverdale Bible of 1535 (Leviticus XXIV, Numbers XV, and Joshua VII), the first bible to be issued in English. The tenor of the propagandist element in this picture is more commonly found in contemporary book illustrations. The pose of Saint Matthew resembles that of a figure in The Stoning of Saint Stephen (Genoa, San Stefano), an altarpiece of about 1521-23 by Giulio Romano, with whom Girolamo da Treviso may have worked when he was still in Italy

08789-nativit.jpg	The painter, a follower of Jan van Eyck, here illustrates the Biblical theme in terms of contemporary life in his native city of Bruges. Joseph, for example, is shown as a Flemish peasant who, realizing he is on holy ground, has removed his wooden clogs. Under the influence of Rogier van der Weyden, Christus has framed the scene with a sculptured archway, typical of late Gothic churches in Flanders. These simulated sculpture groups, depicting the stories in Genesis of man and his sin, illustrate the historical reason for the subject of the painting, the coming of Christ as the Redeemer.

24420-sgeorg.jpg	This large altarpiece is a fine example of the Valencian school during the International Gothic Style in the first quarter of the 15th century. It was traditionally attributed to the German painter established in Valencia, Andr�s Marzal de Sax (or Mar�al de Sas) although this attribution is still subject to debate and leads to more cautiously call the artist responsible for this work 'Master of the Centenar' according to the provenance of the retable most likely executed for the chapel of the Confraternity of the Centenar de la Ploma.The altarpiece illustrates the legend of the St George, a Christian warrior saint, said to have lived at the end of the 3rd century. It is composed of 3 superimposed central panels surmounted by the Holy Spirit and Christ enthroned flanked by two prophets. On each side are depicted 10 scenes of the life of the saint, combining two different narrative cycles: the victory of St George against the dragon and the martyrdom of the saint while the predella panel illustrates 10 scenes of the passion of Christ

42937-1ceilin_.jpg	"The fire in the Doges Palace in 1574 also destroyed the decoration in the Sala del Collegio. Restoration work commenced immediately, and Veronese was commissioned to do the ceiling paintings.The picture shows paintings by Veronese in the gilt wooden ceiling of the Sala del Collegio.The three central panels (Mars and Neptune; Faith and Religion; Venice Ruling with Justice and Peace) are surrounded by eight more canvases of alternating ""T"" and ""L"" shapes containing personifications of the Christian Virtues, interspersed on the longer sides by six more monochrome panels with Scenes from the Greek and Roman History. The allegorical program, the glorification of the ""good governance"" of the Venetian Republic, is clearly defined in the inscriptions that appear in the coffers next to the three biggest canvases: ""Robur imperii"" above Mars and Neptune, ""Nunquam derelicta"" and ""Reipublicae fundamentum"" above and below Faith and Religion and ""Custodes libertatis"" under Venice Ruling with Justice and Peace. The eight figures of the Virtues can be identified by the attributes that accompany them: a dog for Fidelity, a lamb for Gentleness, an ermine for Purity, a die and a crown for Reward, an eagle for Moderation, a cobweb for Dialectics, a crane for Vigilance and a cornucopia for Prosperity. These sumptuous female figures dressed in silks and brocades, splendid in their precious and limpid decorative effects and wonderfully lustrous and transparent colours, almost cancel out the limits of the restricted space to which they are confined by their lavish gilded frames, for they are set against an architectural background that seems to extend from one panel to another, creating a marvelous unity of space.

35068-ladyhami.jpg	Emma Lyon (1765-1815) was the daughter of Henry Lyon, a blacksmith. (She later changed her name to Emma Hart.) She became Lady Hamilton when in 1791 married Sir William Hamilton who was in his fifties. She is best remembered as the mistress of Lord Nelson and as the muse of George Romney. Emma captured Romney's imagination to such an extent that he later described her as 'the divine lady ... superior to all womankind' (Letter, 19 June 1791). In the four years between April 1782 and March 1786 alone, Emma sat to Romney well over 100 times. The outcome of their relationship was a sequence of fancy portraits and literary subjects with dramatic heroines -- over sixty paintings which take Emma as their inspiration or defining feature.George Romney received little formal artistic training, and was largely self-taught. Together with Francis Cotes and, later, Thomas Gainsborough, he was considered the chief rival to Sir Joshua Reynolds as portraitist to the fashionable set in London. Paintings from his mature period, such as the present work, are characterized by a high, fresh colouring and fluent brushwork, the result of a period of study in Italy, where he was impressed by Titian's virtuoso style

35529-01allego.jpg	Rubens painted this moral and political allegory for the Guild of St George, the Antwerp archers' company, in the period of the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648).Rubens, who painted numerous allegories of this sort, shows the victor as a hero in antique armour, bloody sword in hand, seated as if enthroned upon the vanquished figures of Rebellion, symbolised by the torch, and Discord, from whose curls a snake emerges. The goddess of victory crowns him with a wreath of oak leaves. On the right, above the bound figure of Barbarism, a tutelary spirit proffers a a bundle of crossbow bolts, a symbol of concord.

24981-madonna1.jpg	Devotional images of the Madonna seated on the ground, in a position of humility, trace their origin to fourteenth-century Sienese painting. They continued to enjoy widespread popularity throughout Italy in the first half of the fifteenth century. In Florence notable examples were painted by Masaccio, Masolino and Filippo Lippi, but the largest and most important corpus is that of Fra Angelico (the earliest examples are in St. Petersburg, Pisa and Princeton).That the Master of the Castello Nativity studied the work of Fra Angelico is clear not only from the general iconographic features of the painting but from certain motifs, such as the gold embellishment on the sleeve of the angel at the right. Yet, the primary stylistic debt is to Filippo Lippi. The broad-faced  figure types and chubby baby belong to Lippi's repertory, as does the manner in which the drapery of the Virgin is conceived in broad, flat folds

The frescoes were already in poor condition in 1763-64 when they were restored. When the church of the Carmine was largely destroyed by fire in 1771, they suffered comparatively little. Patch made the engravings in 1772 and removed some fragments from the wall, the rest was presumably destroyed in the reconstruction of the church. The fragment shows the head of a musician from the scene of the Feast of Herod

08034-gent_red.jpg	The sitter of this vigorous, half-length Portrait of a Gentleman in Red is probably Count Wackerbarth, who was in Venice in 1739-40 accompanying Prince Frederick Christian of Saxony. This identification is based on the facial similarities to another portrait of the same person, also by Rosalba and conserved in Dresden; the dating to the end of the 1730s is confirmed by the very close similarities in technique - particularly in the use of pencil on the pastel tinted background to suggest the brocade garment

03425-14pastor.jpg	Jacopo Bassano's great contribution to painting was his treatment of religious subjects as if they were genre or everyday scenes, coming close in this respect to the artistic traditions of the north. Bassano preferred to paint those religious subjects which would allow him to introduce peasants and animals, as in the present case, as ell as fruit, vegetables pots, and pans.The figures are modelled with pronounced chiaroscuro and bold areas of colour, which create strongly three-dimensional forms. As in the present painting, he generally places some figures with their back to the viewer and others kneeling down with the soles of their feet facing outwards.This pastoral scene actually depicts the Parable of the Sower, who is placed behind the group of women and children looking after the animals and preparing the meal. The subject offers the artist the chance to depict a genre scene with an ox, sheep, a dog, and, in the foreground, a group of objects such as a copper pot and a bowl. The expressive and spontaneous character of the scene gives it a great naturalness, reinforced by the integration of the group into the landscape, which plays an important role in the painting. Also typical of Bassano's style is the use of a mountainous landscape with a stormy sky

31462-burial.jpg	Pinturicchio was another possible pupil, collaborator, and competitor of Perugino. His career skyrocketed in Rome where he was active on paintings such as this one for a local church, and where he was later hired by the reigning pope, Alexander VI.The Bufalini Chapel frescoes in the Aracoeli require special mention because they are so characteristic of Pinturicchio and because they represent a high degree of accomplishment. He treats here a fairly new iconography, the life of St. Bernardine, who was coincidentally his name saint. The Death of St Bernardine has a spatial stage that opens out onto a deep, irregularly shaped piazza. The architecture throughout is thoroughly up-to-date and elegant, recalling Perugino's treatment in Christ Handing the Keys to St. Peter from the Sistine Chapel. The arrangement of the figures is uncontrived, almost accidental, with subscenes scattered throughout in the receding planes. Incidental naturalistic detail offers visual amusement, with the landscape in the distance treated with particular effectiveness.

Nothing is known about the identity of the sitter; on the basis of the style of the costume, the portrait can be dated to 1515-20.

34697-cairo.jpg	The artist visited the Near East in 1838-39, travelling extensively in Egypt and the Holy Land. Having begun his career as a house-painter and a painter of stage scenery, first in Scotland where he was born and then in England, Roberts established a reputation as a topographical artist during the 1820s, concentrating mainly on European views. The visit to the Near East was, according to Roberts's friend and first biographer, John Ballantine, the 'great central episode of his artistic life'. Indeed, he returned with 272 drawings, a panorama of Cairo and three sketchbooks filled with motifs. The drawings either formed the basis of paintings, or else were published as a series of prints entitled The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt and Nubia, published in three volumes between 1842 and 1849 with the lithographs executed by Louis Haghe. This was the first accurate topographical record of the Holy Land to be published in England.It would seem as though the prints outweighed the significance of the paintings, but, in fact, Roberts produced more paintings of the Near East than of any other area he visited. The popularity of these paintings was in part due to their quality, but it was also as a result of the growing interest in the Holy Land and the neighbouring countries associated with the Bible. This interest increased during the 1830s at the same time as travel became easier in these areas. Roberts was thus able to capitalise on this situation. His views are not simply accurate records of the appearance of buildings. Genre elements are introduced as he himself became interested in the social mores of these different countries. The few biblical narratives, inspired by Old Testament subjects, that were painted by Roberts before he went to the Holy Land were conceived by contrast in the manner of John Martin.In A View in Cairo the view is towards the Gate of Zuweyleh (colloquially known as Mutwalli or Metwalis), over which tower the minarets of the mosque of Sultan Mu'ayyad Shaykh. The entrance to the mosque itself is on the right. Roberts also made a painting of the interior, for which he had to have special permission

Of those who did Giambattista Pittoni turned the lessons of Ricci to his own use in a personal style whose elegant, rhythmic composition and delicate tonal clarity clearly announce his involvement in the world of rococo. Pittoni's taste for virtuoso display intensified still further towards the end of his career. It was in this period (1758) that he painted the 'Annunciation' to decorate the 'stanza dello studio' of the Old Academy which had been founded in 1750 at the Fonteghetto della Farina. The theatrical layout of the composition and the precious refinement of the drawing lend the sacred subject the air of an animated ballet with wonderfully fresh chromatic harmonies

17231-4earlie2.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 484, JH 1771.In August and September 1888, van Gogh executed four paintings depicting sunflowers in a vase. He intended to decorate a room in the house, the so-called Yellow House, that he rent in Arles. He also painted a portrait of his bedroom in the Yellow House as part of the projected decoration of the house with works which would show Gauguin what he had been doing.Powerful effects of immediacy and invitation were achieved in the painting by the deviation from rigorous geometric perspective. The spatial effect of the relationship between the objects in the painting and the position in which we as spectators are placed has been perceptively described as 'phenomenological space', that is, spatial relations as we experience and remember them rather than as they are conventionally represented in paintings made according to the geometric perspective systems used by artists since the Renaissance. Thus, in addition to exploiting the expressive possibilities of colour, van Gogh was investigating the expressive possibilities of new representations of space.Van Gogh made this second version of The Bedroom about a year after the first, while he was living at an asylum in Saint-R�my

23998-zeno02.jpg	"For the main altar of the Veronese church of San Zeno, Mantegna produced one of the finest and most influential altarpieces of the period. The altarpiece occupies a privileged position in the church, because the main altar area is raised above the level of the nave, and a special window was opened to increase the amount of light on the picture. The design of the elaborate gilt wood frame is probably based upon Donatello's high altar for the Paduan church dedicated to Saint Anthony, which, however, included bronze statues and reliefs rather than paintings. At the base are three large, nearly square predella scenes. These panels are copies, the originals were taken by Napoleon and are now in French museums.The painting is an early masterpiece of the young Mantegna. Although the basic format of the painting is essentially that of the late Gothic polyptychs it nevertheless breaks new grounds in the way this traditional scheme is handled. The stage upon which the holy gathering takes place is set against an ""open air"" background. The garlands suspended from the proscenium which appear to thread between the simulated columns of the painting and the actual wooden ones of the frame, dissolve the idea of the fourth wall of the traditional perspective box. The spacial games of this painting have come a long way from Brunelleschi's method of projecting the painted image onto an ideal plane. Perspective has now become a sophisticated means of achieving concrete reality"

21140-view_lak.jpg	K&#248;bke spent most of his childhood at the Citadel in Copenhagen where his father was a baker. In 1832 he rented a studio on Toldbodvej (now Esplanaden), which offered him a new view on his childhood home. From the studio window he could look over the neighbour opposite to the Citadel.Above the treetops he could see the Citadel mill, the ridge turret of the Citadel Church, the red rooftops of the military buildings, and the Oresund coastline in the far distance. In order to create depth in the small picture he added the edge of the neighbouring house&#146;s roof and a chimney in the foreground. The chimney in particular is quite a stroke of genius, testifying to artistic boldness. It is unlikely that any other Danish painter working at the time would have let something as unimportant as a chimney occupy such a central position in a picture

17839-blac635.jpg	This painting (La Romeria de San Isidro) was originally in the ground floor room of the Quinta del Sordo.The Pilgrimage to San Isidro filled one long wall of the Quinta, opposite a painting called The Great He-Goat or Witches' Sabbath in the downstairs room of the house. Goya may have been prompted to paint this subject by the fact that the Quinta was built in the neighbourhood of the Hermitage of San Isidro and by the recollection of having painted the Hermitage and the Meadow of San Isidro in happier, earlier days. Without knowledge of the title, however, it would be hard to identify the procession of figures moving forward, their features becoming clearer and more awful as they get near, as a procession of pilgrims. Goya's viewpoint in this painting must have been close to that in the Meadow scene, but there is no view of the city in the background

17502-11virgin.jpg	This painting joins a series of late Virgin and Child paintings in which Gossart explored the physical nature of the bond between the two figures. In this series he searched for solutions to the physical relationship of figures, just as he had done with his drawings and paintings of Adam and Eve. Taking inspiration from Italian examples he had observed on his trip to Rome in 1508-09, Gossart exaggerated the poses of figures to suit his increasingly mannered mode of presentation. Among the sources of inspiration a number of the Della Robbia terracottas display a pose of the Virgin and Child similar to that of Gossart's painting.This painting belonged to King Philip II, who gave it to the Monastery of El Escorial in 1572

44736-1coral.jpg	The elegant Coral Fishers (also referred to as Allegory of the Discovery of the New World) and the Allegory of the Creation (also in the Galleria Borghese) by Jacopo Zucchi formerly decorated Cardinal Ferdinando's studiolo in the Villa Medici in Rome.It was probably thanks to the Florentine Jacopo Zucchi, in Rome from the papacy of Gregory XIII (1572-85) and to the taste of his patron Cardinal Ferdinando de'Medici that paintings designed for small rooms began to be imported. These paintings, which had the same artificiality as the decorative work produced in Giorgio Vasari's workshop in Florence for the Studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio, were added to the collection being assembled by the cardinal for the Villa Medici in Rome. Although these were tiny paintings, executed for a private client, their fame reached the pages of Giovanni Baglione, who records among the 'many things' painted by Jacopo Zucchi for the cardinal, the furnishing of a 'studiolo in the palace built in the garden of the Medici with a painting representing fishing for coral with many naked ladies, but very small, among these there are many portraits of beautiful and distinguished Roman matrons of the day, and it is a marvellous thing to see.'Some of the paintings made by Zucchi for this decorative scheme have been identified. Together with others then in Roman collections, they testify to his inventive skill and extraordinary imagination. Zucchi infused mythological scenes with an attention to naturalistic details, as in the Coral Fishers. His paintings are often small in scale and painted on copper, which, with their descriptive accuracy, connects them with the paintings produced by northern European painters then temporarily working in Rome

38381-miloncro.jpg	Milo (or Milon) of Croton was a legendary Greek wrestler from the Greek settlement of Croton in southern Italy. He won the wrestling contest at five successive Olympic Games, and swept the board at all other festivals. A man of huge stature, he boasted that no one had ever brought him to his knees. It is said that he carried a live ox upon his shoulders through the stadium at Olympia, then ate it all in a single day. Tradition has it that in his old age, on seeing an oak tree partly split open with a wedge he tried to wrench it apart, but only succeeded in causing the wedge to fall out, thereby trapping his hands. He was left a helpless prey to the wild beast who soon finished him off. He is usually depicted in Baroque art as a partly naked muscular figure, his hands imprisoned by a tree trunk, and attacked by a lion.The undated, but still baroque Milo of Croton shows the Greek athlete being devoured by wolves, his hand caught in a cleft tree trunk. Milon's pose was borrowed from the famous Hellenistic statue of Laoco�n. It is an early work and a copy after the Frenchman Jean Jacques Bachelier.You can view other depictions of Milo of Croton in the Web Gallery of Art

18094-4interce.jpg	Along with the original commission to fresco the choir of Sant'Agostino in San Gimignano, Gozzoli received a number of other requests, including two 'Pestbilder' (a painted prayer against the plague). For the Sant'Agostino, Gozzoli created a votive fresco showing St Sebastian Intercessor on the southern nave wall. This work was painted during the outbreak  of the plague in 1464, as we are informed by the inscription on the saint's pedestal. This would mean that Gozzoli interrupted  the painting of the apsidal chapel in order to produce this picture.The outbreak of the plague caused a rapid increase in depictions of St Sebastian where the saint is clad only in a loincloth and tied to a tree or column. Here he is standing dressed on a pedestal. God the Father, surrounded by angels holding arrows in their hands, appears above the saint's head. He is about to hurl the arrow he is holding at the world. Mary and Christ are kneeling before him as intercessors. Christ is pointing to the open wound on his side and Mary is baring her breast in order to remind God of their sacrifices for the Christians and move him to be lenient. The prayer of St Sebastian is keeping off God's arrows which are breaking behind him, thus protecting the people crowded at his feet.The Augustinian behind the white-haired man in profile on the left is probably a portrait of Domenico Strambi, presumably the author of the iconographic program of the Scenes from the Life of St Augustine, painted by Benozzo in the choir of Sant'Agostino. Furthermore, on the small devotional picture of the Crucifixion on the lower frame of the fresco, the donor portrait of Domenico Strambi can be seen

18203-0208grec.jpg	This very small panel is probably the most completely Venetian of his paintings, and, almost certainly, was finished shortly before leaving for Rome at the end of 1570. With its comparatively robust figures and the perspective of its pavement sharply receding into the background, it provides a good contrast with his later Spanish works. The Annunciation was one of the themes most in harmony with his genius, inspiring some of his most splendid paintings. A much larger version, often thought of as his finest interpretation of this subject was carried out as part of the series for the Colegio de Do&#241;a Mar�a, Madrid, and appears to have been the central painting of the retable of the high altar

14931-6pould01.jpg	The painting, which was produced at Le Pouldu in December 1889, is a blend of fidelity to nature (he paints the sand pink, as he perceives it, rather than the yellow one would expect it to be) and of careful planning, with preparatory studies. At the same time, he recognized that he was still working within certain well-established conventional norms - the distortion of the limbs and the exaggeration of the hands to suggest the tedium of physical labour, something that he could have observed in the representations of peasant life in the work of Millet or Van Gogh			
43063-bride.jpg	"The painting is both signed and dated ""J.V. Spronk 1640"".Verspronck's career in the years immediately after 1640 is distinguished by the abundance of his production and the maturity of his style. This female portrait is similar to other slightly earlier works from 1636-37. In his use of light and gradation of background tones from left to right, combined with the novel and distinctly lateral placement of the figure, the artist throws the contours of the sitter's black dress into high relief against a luminous background. This technique is typical of Verspronck's female portraits, and along with the torsion of the figure's bust the contrast serves to enhance the plasticity of the dark mass of the clothing. In the pose and use of contrasting light a direct connection can be made with similar portrait in a private Dutch collection, as well as with a series of female portraits (1640-45) that Verspronck carried out as parts of paired ""couples"". (The companion-piece of the painting, the Portrait of a Husband is also in the Rome museum.) After this period Verspronck changed his approach to composition and treatment of light, above all abandoning the method of contrasting dark clothing with an illuminated ground.The sitters in such formal portraits as these are generally dressed in the most elaborate and modish version of contemporary costume. Comparing their clothes to the changes in fashion allows us to establish an approximate date for such pictures, though in many cases (such as this pair) the works are actually signed and dated by the artist"

37698-valencib.jpg	Sorolla's approach to light and colour was rooted in the idiosyncratic Valencian school. Valencian art was notable for its efforts to capture the brief, passing moment by using rapid, unbroken brush-strokes and precision colourism. The vivid plein-air scenes, mainly Mediterranean, that the artists recorded in this style nonetheless preserved tonal unities, and might be better described as luminist than Impressionist.Sorolla arrived at plein-air painting via years as apprentice and journeyman in Valencia, Rome and Paris. Returning to Spain in 1889, he settled in Madrid, where his art began to undergo a stylistic transformation: he attached greater importance to changing conditions of light, and preferred scenes of Spanish folk life, especially in Mediterranean coastal areas. The Beach at Valencia is a good example of this kind of work

07799-06holyfa.jpg	In the first decade of the 16th century Vittore Carpaccio adds a superior quality of style to his art, keeping his adherence to the rigid canons of perspective construction unaltered and continuing to pay great attention to the definition of his spaces, to the perfect harmony of colours, without basically incorporating any of the novelties being developed around him. In the Holy Family with Two Donors in the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon, dated 1505, the broad landscape modelled on the art of Giorgione stands in contrast to the artist's usual practice of not relating the natural atmosphere to the mood of the human figures in the foreground

02965-sebastia.jpg	Baglione's tender image of an angel delicately extracting an arrow from St Sebastian's side is indicative of the new emphasis placed on succour and compassion during the post-Tridentine period by the Oratorians and other religious orders. Images of St Sebastian bound to a tree and pierced with arrows had become increasingly popular from the fifteenth century on, partly because they gave artists an excuse to depict the male nude within a religious context. The inclusion of an angel tending the saint's wounds is very rare, but undoubtedly reflects devotional literature that recounted how Christ sent an angel to untie Sebastian and cure his wounds. The angel can also be linked to the contemporary cult of guardian angels, who were believed to take the outward appearance of youthful boys. Similar guardian angels can be found in Caravaggio's Stigmatisation of St Francis (Wadsword Atheneum, Hartford), Orazio Gentileschi's St Francis Supported by an Angel (Museo del Prado, Madrid), and Baglione's own St Francis Comforted by Two Angels (Private collection), which is dated 1601.Baglione's two paintings are among the earliest examples of Caravaggio's influence on another artist. More irritated than flattered by the attention, Caravaggio openly ridiculed Baglione, claiming that he did not know a single painter who would praise him as a good artist. In truth, Baglione did not fully absorb the intricacy of his model. While in the St Sebastian he easily adopted superficial qualities, such as bold, raking light and fleshy, full-lipped faces, the carefully honed emotional depth of Caravaggio's work was beyond his grasp. The picture is listed in the 1724 inventory of Anna Maria Sannesio, the last direct heir of Cardinal Giacomo Sannesio, who had purchased Caravaggio's Conversion of St Paul after it was rejected for the Cerasi Chapel. There is a strong possibility that he was the original owner of Baglione's St Sebastian

His views of the city, of walkers in the park, the Seine, or avenues were among the best that Impressionism produced - even if an undisciplined brushwork or a confrontational approach to objects and forms could sometimes mar the effect.The panorama cityscape of the French capital is unusual not only in van Gogh's oeuvre but in the paintings from that period as well.

43870-bridge.jpg	The enthusiasm of Julian Alden Weir for the work of Japanese artists such as Hokusai or Hiroshige may have been prompted by the tales of friends who visited Japan and by exhibitions of Japanese print graphics in America. In the 1880s and 1890s Japanese art offered many painters a new direction to follow. One of Weir's most popular paintings, The Red Bridge, exemplifies his use of diagonal composition and zones of colour. The bridge, its colour contrasting strongly with natural setting, opens up decorative possibilities when seen together with its reflection - two diagonals running in at an angle to each other. The detailed brushwork, a product of Weir's study of Impressionism, loosens the composition without fragmenting it

23391-2twiligh.jpg	K�roly Lotz was an active and celebrated painter of second half of the last century. Many of his large murals can be found in the capital in public buildings (Opera House, National Museum), churches and private places. He studied in Vienna under Karl Rahl and his works show the effect of the great Renaissance masters, Raphael in particular. Most of his paintings are of mythological subjects, portraits or nudes, though in the early phase of his art he did some significant representations of native scenery such as the Great Hungarian Plain and the life of the peasants.The setting sun hidden behind a cloud lights up the landscape of the plain, catching the shepherd and his herd in the foreground and the gleaming surface of the water.

10430-alexande.jpg	"The meeting between the classical ruler Alexander the Great and the philosopher Diogenes had been illustrated in the 15th and 16th centuries but was also a popular subject in Italian and Netherlandish Baroque painting. Diogenes replied to Alexander, the conqueror of the world, when he asked him if he wanted anything: ""Stand a little less between me and the sun."" The contrast between the youthful and beautiful hero and the beggarly old man whose life exemplified asceticism is exploited in the composition and use of colours. The message of the painting is the meaninglessness of earthly power when confronted with ethical principles. The Antwerp artist de Crayer later became court painter to the archduke in Brussels.

22363-1queens.jpg	Besides a few visits to his home country, S�ndor (Alexander) Liezen-Mayer, who was born in Gy�r, Hungary, spent his entire life in Munich, where he was a much respected professor at the Academy. He painted this study as a young man in Karl Piloty's class in 1862. Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary at the Sarcophagus of Louis Anjou the Great of Hungary is a courageous, though avowedly theatrical composition built on the contrast between the splendid coronation ceremony of Small Charles of Durazzo, scene in the background, and graveness of the two queens vowing vengeance at the grave of King Louis the Great.

36668-panel2.jpg	Two paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Christ before Pilate and The Resurrection, most likely once formed the recto and verso of the same panel. They probably belonged to a house altarpiece of the Passion of Christ that consisted of a central sculpture depicting the Crucifixion flanked by wings with four scenes, each painted on both sides.Two other double-sided panels in private collections were associated with this house altarpiece. The fourth panel is missing. The compositions of the Passion scenes in the altarpiece derive generally from Martin Schongauer's widely distributed engravings. However, they are not exact copies, and it is quite likely that Ludwig made freely adapted drawings after Martin's engravings as a starting point for his own paintings. Eight such drawings are convincingly attributed to Ludwig

08543-3figure3.jpg	In April 1886, C�zanne married Hortense Fiquet in Aix. The reason why, after so long, he decided to make his relationship with Hortense official, despite not having loved her for a long time, was probable to ensure that their son Paul, now aged fourteen, did not suffer the stigma of having unmarried parents.The present portrait shows Hortense sitting against a background which is divided into two parts: on the right is a door, with strictly geometric paneling; on the left is patterned wallpaper and the ornamental top of an occasional table. The pale, cool blue of the door is in sharp contrast with the warm earthy tones of the wall-hanging and the piece of furniture. The sitter is posed leaning slightly to one side, a motionless, monumental figure. The flesh tints of her serious, withdrawn looking face echo the colours of the background, and the opening of her jacket also helps to divide the composition into two.C�zanne uses a similar process in his portraits to that of his landscapes: they are formal, strict, with a monumental, permanent quality

19835-04solot.jpg	The commission came from the city clerk of Basel, Johannes Gerster, and his wife Barbara Guildinknopf. The couple's coats of arms are woven into the cloth that covers the steps of the throne, which is also where Holbein signed and dated his work. The work is a sacra conversazione, a popular form of Madonna favoured in Upper Italy, especially by Bellini and Giorgione and their circles, where the Virgin is depicted almost always sitting or standing centrally and is flanked by saints. Holbein's composition enables praying believers to address the Virgin and Saints Martin and Ursus with the confidence that their intercession with God will grant the faithful the certainty of salvation. The Virgin looks at the viewers with a kindly gaze and gently inclined head, presenting to them the Christ Child, who raises His hand in a childlike blessing.The Madonna sits beneath a bare tunnel vault, flanked by two saints. The figure on the left, the bishop giving alms to a beggar, is St Martin. The knight in armor, whose only attribute is a red flag with a white cross held in his right hand, must be St Ursus. The minster in Solothurn is dedicated to him, and he is also venerated in St Martin's in Basel. The picture must have been intended for this church, where the man who commissioned the picture, Johannes Gerster, was provisor

09696-02madonn.jpg	Pietro da Cortona's oeuvre contains splendid examples of rich altarpieces which are a triumph of his proud and exultant style. Some also provide memorable examples of Baroque taste. This painting was commissioned by the Passerini family for the church of S. Agostino in the painter's home town. In a civilized fashion, it trumpets the fact that some of the Passerini family were members of chivalrous orders. So we see the Knights of St Stephen (notice the cross on the cope of the pope, St Stephen), the Knights of Malta (represented by the figure of John the Baptist and the cloak in the centre) and the Order of Calatrava (St James the Great can be seen behind John the Baptist). Even in this quiet scene, there is an air of great energy and vigour, almost as if the saints were about to burst into song. The colours are also marvelously fresh and vivid

07268-canal718.jpg	This bridge was paid for in 1747 by the Member of Parliament, Samuel Dicker, whose house is among the buildings on the far bank of the Thames, at the left. The view Canaletto has chosen shows the river from the Middlesex, or north side, looking upstream. He has peppered the scene with naturalistic details and human incident: a storm cloud with sheeting rain effectively contrasts with the white latticed wood of the bridge, over which an impressive carriage is drawn; in the foreground the mast of a boat has been lowered so it can travel beneath its arches, and a seated artist, who must be Canaletto himself, is depicted.Old Walton Bridge was painted for Thomas Hollis; it bears the inscription on the reverse 'Made in the year 1754 in London for the first and last time with the utmost care at the request of Mr. Hollis, my most esteemed patron - Antonio del Canal, called Canaletto.' According to an old catalogue of the Hollis collection the three standing figures to the right of the artist are Hollis himself, his friend Thomas Brand who inherited the painting, and his Italian servant Francesco Giovannini; the little animal between them is Hollis's pet dog, Malta
