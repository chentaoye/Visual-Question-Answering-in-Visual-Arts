42102-19studi3.jpg	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments. Two doors, not distinguished in any way from the cupboard doors, cover the only windows: Francesco preferred to work by candlelight.The intimate scale of the project allowed Vasari and his pupils to develop their imaginative abilities, technical skill, and jewel-like delicacy of colour. Eight sculptors made the bronze statuettes, and the paintings were by twenty-four artists. This precious chamber is the only sixteenth-century room in Europe to survive with its oil paintings intact

08536-2still1.jpg	In the background of the painting, sections of two picture frames and a wall-covering form a slight diagonal running through the picture. In front stands a table, cut off at both ends by the sides of the picture, its lower edge only slightly above the bottom edge of the painting and is almost parallel to it. On the table, next to the vase containing the flowers, are a bottle, a plate, and another vessel. Three apples lie in the foreground, in line with the vase. The small number of carefully placed objects are organized in a skillful interplay of verticals, horizontals, and diagonals.The range of colours reflects Cï¿½zanne's striving for equilibrium. The most intense colour values are seen in the flowers, where red is juxtaposed with white, and white with green. The harmony of the picture is basically determined by the subtle range of various shades of blue, which are accompanied by contrasting orange and pale ochre, the complementary colour. Around the central blue vase, which dominates the composition, the tallest flowers form a turquoise group; as if by extension, the wall has a bluish sheen, and even the shadows of the objects assembled on the table are blue

31257-procris.jpg	This painting was probably part of the decoration of a palace in Florence.Despite the different datings they have been given the two panels (Death of Procris, and Venus and Mars) may have formed part of a cycle illustrating themes from ancient mythology. Considering that they stem from the hand of a Florentine artist, both demonstrate an unusual interest in landscape. The progression towards lighter colours in the background and the accompanying softening of focus reflect Leonardo da Vinci's new theories of colour.The first panel shows the death of Procris, killed by mistake, while out hunting, by a javelin which Procris had been given by King Minos and which never missed its mark. The dog on the right was also a gift from Minos

06020-2twins.jpg	Salomon de Bray is usually remembered for his classical compositions - he was selected to paint large decorated fields for the Oranjezaal at Huis ten Bosch. Yet his double portrait of his nephew's twins puts him squarely in the tradition of Dutch naturalistic portraiture. The chiaroscuro effect and the colour scheme of the painting are reminiscent of Rembrandt's work of the 1640s, but stylistic slots are the last thing to come to mind when confronted by this touching image of two tiny babies wearing what are presumably their baptismal lockets lying in a richly carved gilded Baroque shell-like cradle

23914-bacchus.jpg	"Until 1924 the painting was considered to be a work of Caravaggio, then Bartolomeo Manfredi was accepted by all the subsequent critics. The dating of the painting, however, is made difficult by the uncertainty about the chronology of Manfredi's career in general. It could be placed in the first decade of the century.The early date of the Bacchus, an allegorical subject that recalls Caravaggio's earliest works, places us at the beginning of the artist's development of a so-called ""Manfredian Method"". The body of work to which this term refers is derived from the great Caravaggesque prototypes, and focuses on drinkers, game-players, gypsies, and tavern scenes. The style enjoyed a notable popularity in the second and third decades of the seventeenth century. This genre was particularly wide-spread, probably on account of its suitability to the transmission of allegorical and moral messages. The figure of Bacchus, derived from the models of ancient statuary and sarcophagi is probably also inspired by a lost prototype by Caravaggio, cited by Baglione."

42885-9lastsup.jpg	In the eighties Paolo returned once again to the theme of the Lord's Supper in the canvas painted around 1585 for the Venetian church of Santa Sofia, where it was until 1811 and now is in Brera. Here too the painter substantially modified the compositional structure he had adopted in the past for similar pictures. In particular, he changed the location of Christ, who no longer dominates the centre of the scene but is placed on the left-hand edge of the canvas, while the long table is now set diagonally instead of being viewed from the front. In addition, the triumphant architectural setting of the feasts he painted in the sixties and seventies has vanished completely and the event now takes place in modest surroundings, emphasizing Christ's message of humility and poverty

29300-308muril.jpg	Murillo painted this picture when he was sixty; it was commissioned by Canon Justino de Neve for the refectory of a home for retired priests in Seville, hence the choice of theme: the distribution of bread to the elderly, an action symbolizing charity.It is a characteristically vertical Baroque composition with the Child in the centre; his face, however, bears no trace of the light-heartedness characteristic of Murillo's young beggar boys. It is a childish face, charming, yet exalted and spiritualized; but the painting of the body indicates how closely Murillo observed the proportions and movements of small children. Equally beautiful and exalted is the face of the ministering angel. But Mary, seated behind the Child, is the embodiment of motherhood, a human being of this earth, comely but without true beauty, anxious and concerned as she watches her little son. In the seventeenth century subtle brushwork and carefully selected hues were used to separate what was earthly from what was heavenly. The angel, the Infant Jesus and the putti floating among the clouds are represented as visionary beings; but Mary, the daughter of earthly people, and the group of three pilgrims are all represented as human beings of this earth as real as the basket of bread which is as closely observed as any still-life.It is assumed that the pilgrim with a book is the portrait of Canon Justino de Neve. Several later (19th century) copies of the painting are known (e.g. Cadiz, Seville, etc.)

41164-x_piase.jpg	This German High Renaissance panel shows the Virgin Mary seated on a grassy bank with the Christ Child standing on her lap. She tenderly offers Him some grapes, while behind them the sunlit landscape spreads out past a single tree, leading across lakeside houses and bridges and pastures towards a distant hill top castle.Stylistically, this painting has always been closely associated with the work of Lucas Cranach the Elder, and there can be little doubt that its author must have been closely acquainted with his work and may well have trained in his workshop. Iconographically the composition, with the Virgin seated full-length in a landscape, was derived in German art from the earlier work of Martin Schongauer and particularly Albrecht Dï¿½rer, who had both explored the theme in a series of woodcuts and engravings from the 1480s onwards.This painting was part of the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Collection, and after the death of the collector it was sold through Sotheby's in July 2014. Profit from the sale goes to the Barbara Piasecka Johnson Foundation for Autistic Children created in 1974. The anonymous painter of this extraordinary panel is referred to as the Master of the Piasecka Johnson Madonna

26059-17noadv.jpg	In the 1480s Memling was at the peak of his abilities and his output had grown to such an extent that we must suppose that he not only worked quickly and efficiently, but that he also had assistants. The latter might have applied the first layers of colour to the drawing or might even have executed background figures or trees and plants in the style of the master. The input of journeymen is generally impossible to distinguish because it merges imperceptibly into the uniformity of the finished product. The Advent and Triumph of Christ, for instance, which measures two metres across and was completed in 1480, displays consistent painterly virtuosity and dazzling colour from corner to corner. Wrongly interpreted as the Seven Joys of the Virgin, it consists of a biblical world landscape in which the story of the Salvation is set in an ingenious narrative and spatial manner, linked syntactically by the procession of the Magi as they cross the picture plane. It is the joyful counterpart to the earlier Scenes from the Passion of Christ in Turin, and is conceived in a similar continuous narrative manner.The painting was destined for the altar of the Tanners' guild in the most easterly chapel of Our Lady's Church in Bruges. It was donated by Pieter Bultinc, `tanner and merchant', and his wife Katelyne van Ryebeke, as recorded on the old frame, which survived until the end of the eighteenth century

40794-madvitus.jpg	"The half length figure of the Virgin holding her Child in front of her on her right side appears in an ornate, three-dimensional frame - though we are not sure whether the frame originally belonged to the picture.Although the whole composition and the manner in which Mary is showing her Child to the congregation of the faithful has preserved the formal solemnity of devotional pictures, the almost coquettish posture of her head and the animation of the Child radiate a natural atmosphere.The striking three-dimensional qualities of the painting point to the influence of the sculptures of ""Beautiful Madonnas"" of the period, indeed, some scholars believe that the painter is identical with the master of the Beautiful Madonna of Krumlov. Precise and subtle modelling conveys the full forms of the figures, as do the deep, falling folds of the Virgin's mantle, which is made of some heavy fabric; the Child's body and hands are represented organically, and the two figures constitute a group imagined in spatial terms. The Virgin is depicted in a complicate counterpoise: her body is not only bent sidewise, but is also drawn backwards, whereas the whole torso of Jesus faces the spectator. The movements of the two figures in opposite directions stress that the construction of the composition is determined by the two diagonals of the oblong standing frame. The torso of the Virgin is bent into the direction of the diagonal line directed towards the upper right corner, while her head and the Child's body parallel with it point to the opposite direction. The two flesh-coloured areas, the face and the body, are placed in the middle of that diagonal line. The harmonious overall effect of the well-poised composition is intensified by the fact that the Infant's right shoulder is merged with that of His mother and by this means a single, undisturbed outline encloses the two figures"

44597-vil_godi.jpg	In the sixteenth century a large number of fresco decorations was based on well-known literary works of antiquity. In addition to Ovid's Metamorphoses, the Latin and Greek works that frequently provided inspiration for mural paintings included Virgil's Aeneid, Livy's Roman history with depictions of Roman virtues, Plutarch's Lives, Valerius Maximus's Dicta and facta memorabilia, and Apuleius's Golden Ass.The scenes in the central hall in the Villa Godi are based on Plutarch's Lives.

40312-203turne.jpg	In the same Royal Academy exhibition as his Snow Storm, Turner showed a pair of pictures, Peace - Burial at Sea and War, the Exile and the Rock Limpet. The first is a haunting tribute to David Wilkie, who had died and been buried at sea off Gibraltar the previous year, on his way back from a visit to the Holy Land. The other, ostensibly of the exiled Napoleon on his island prison of St Helena, alluded to Wilkie's close friend Haydon. Haydon was famous both for his own pictures of Napoleon and for the egotism, paranoia and constant warfare with colleagues, critics and patrons that had by this time brought him to a state of professional exile. Peace is more than a farewell to a friend: it signals approval for the exemplary harmony in which Wilkie had lived. Its companion piece is a warning and a rebuke.In the War, the Exile and the Rock Limpet, Napoleon, the man who once ruled the world is reduced to a costumed doll, his reflection conversing in a puddle with a rock limpet. The dying sun dominates the centre of the picture and symbolizes world chaos, in which history is played out only as the downfall of an individual. The futility of man's existence is presented to us by Turner as the ultimate futility of history. Power and decline, greatness and absurdity, importance and banality coincide here

In one of these self-portraits he shows himself as artist, dressed in his blue working smock, holding his palette and turning from his easel to stare at the spectator. The effect is lively and intense, partly as a result of the powerful blues and yellows in which he has painted himself. In the other portrait, illustrated here, van Gogh appears before us dressed in a smart suit and waistcoat, without his professional attributes. The pose and coloration produce a calmer and more dignified portrait. The background is decoratively textured with its weaving of thick brushstrokes. Apart from the white of the collarless shirt, and the flesh tones composed of pinks and delicate greens, the portrait is an exercise in blue and orange

29488-1elegant.jpg	Eglon van der Neer devoted a great deal of attention to the minutest details in his genre paintings - from the foreground to the most distant point in the background - though this did not always serve to heighten the natural effect of these scenes. The very precise and accurate rendering of the various materials sometimes gives his paintings a cool, distant feel. Nevertheless, Van der Neer was highly successful: the opulent interiors and the extremely costly materials he so accurately depicted must have appealed to the imagination of his clients. He was admired by many of the crowned heads of Europe and worked as court painter to the Elector Palatine Johann Wilhelm.The rich, fashionably dressed burghers who are the subject of Elegant Couple in an Interior are shown surrounded by several servants. Van der Neer paid great attention to the costly fabrics of the clothes of the elegant couple in the foreground. He rendered the sheen and transparency of ribbons, embroidery and lace with the utmost care, and the man's beautifully coifed wig received the same meticulous attention to detail. The various elements in the painting have not been forged into a unified whole, however. Eglon van der Neer probably wanted to demonstrate his technical skill in the depiction of details. The great variety of materials is certainly no coincidence.We cannot say with any certainty whether the painting depicts anything more than two people in a stylish interior. The fact that the couple in the background are drinking and their rather too intimate behaviour might indicate that this is a brothel scene

14592-mushroom.jpg	"The fact that this subtle still-life is known under the title Mushrooms is understandable given the prominent place taken by four boletus in the left foreground of the picture. This name fails, though, to do justice to the other elements that, precisely through their presence alongside the mushrooms, form an exceptionally balanced composition: to the left a wicker basket, to the right of it a melon, a root of celery and four thrushes, which, along with the warm, greenish brown colouring, appear to evoke autumn. It is not impossible that a reference to autumn is indeed woven into this jewel of a painting. But apart from the objects themselves there is no unambiguous reference to any symbolic, literary or allegorical significance. This may be precisely one of the charms of what is a fairly self enclosed painting for a modern viewer whose pictorial culture has been so strongly formed by the poetic cult of art for art's sake and form for form's sake, i.e. of ""pure"" art, which turns its back on any prosaic anecdotal intent. Or whose sensitivity for the refined play of surfaces and for carefully balanced colour nuances and the objects that populate everyday life has since been whetted by contact with masters like Jean Simï¿½on Chardin.The still-life painter Jan Fyt was a pupil of his better known colleague Frans Snyders. In 1629 he became a free master in Antwerp, but he also lived in Paris and in Italy. His oeuvre had a major influence on Pieter Boel, who may well have been his pupil. Fyt was a self-confident artist whose sophisticated and expensive work was, in his own words, purchased mainly by the high nobility. His art reflects a more general development towards an aristocratisation of social life. In the noticeable refinement of texture and colour, Fyt's relationship to Snyders is similar to that of Anthony van Dyck to Peter Paul Rubens. In Rubens and Snyders robust, highly plastic forms dominate. Not averse to a certain degree of sentimentality, Van Dyck and Fyt seem to exchange this organic powerfulness for a fragile sensitivity. This leads to an art that will speak in particular to lovers of artistic nuance"

32803-35canig.jpg	The Canigiani Holy Family in Munich is attributed to the same period as the Entombment (1504-1506). The painting's name derives from the Florentine family who owned it before it passed into the Medici collection and then into Germany with the marriage of Anna Maria Lodovica de' Medici to the Palatine Elector.The Virgin and Elizabeth are sitting on the grass with their children, and Joseph is standing over them - this shows the importance of Jesus' adoptive father, and gives expression to the increase in the worship of Joseph after 1500. In 1982 the German conservator Hubert von Sonnenburg undertook a careful restoration of this picture and removed a distorting blue overpaint, dating from the 18th century, from the sky area. Raphael's original concept, with the putti on the upper left and right, can now be admired anew.In this work Raphael synthesizes elements drawn from Leonardo and Michelangelo and compounds them with a decisively Northern landscape and delicate colourist passages dominated by iridescent tones. The pyramid in which the figures are ideally enclosed is still drawn from models provided by Leonardo, but the relationships between the figures, developed through the glances they exchange and through the serene feelings they communicate, carry the composition onto a calmly descriptive plane. The tone of the painting is thus quite different from the tense and restless art of Leonardo. His unsurpassed descriptive capacity permits Raphael to create an image full of human participation and limpid serenity

42125-08vecchi.jpg	With the growth of his stature and cultural ambitions when he was compiling and writing his book, the Lives of the Artists, the nature of Vasari's commissions fundamentally altered in the final thirty years of his life, from individual works such as altarpieces to grand enterprises in different media requiring a controlling hand over a large body of assistants. To accomplish these great projects he organized a vast workshop on a scale unprecedented in Florence.The best example of the grand enterprises are the ceiling and walls of the main room, the Sala del Cinquecento, in the Palazzo del Signoria in Florence, completed 1565. The ceiling is divided into 39 panels depicting episodes from the history of Florence and the Grand-duchy of Tuscany. Along the upper part of the walls are battle scenes by Vasari, below are a series of statues and marble groups

12088-charles.jpg	This painting is unusual for the topographical view, in which one may see in the distance, across the Poitevin landscape, the ruins of the sixteenth century Ch&#226;teau of Mondon. The stylishly dressed Count Barthï¿½lemy-Charles (born in 1760) stands on a balustrade terrace, his height accentuated by the column to his right. He wears his cravat in a fashionable knot, and the artist has paid considerable attention to the Count's elegant waistcoat and fine gloves.The painting was acquired by then Senator John F. Kennedy in 1958 as a present for his wife and hung in their Georgetown home, before being transferred to the White House after his election as 35th President of the United States. It was hung in the family quarters until the assassination of the President, but remained in the collection of his widow until her death in 1994

44070-2croy2.jpg	"Rogier van der Weyden was appointed official painter to the city of Brussels in 1436. His work for the city included paintings on the theme of justice for the court room of the town hall. Besides his official work, he was commissioned to do a large number of portraits, usually by distinguished patrons at the Burgundian court (Duke Philip the Good, his son Duke Charles the Bold, Philip de Croy, ""Le Grand Batard de Bourgogne"", Francesco d'Este, Nicolas Rolin etc.). He was a talented painter of portraits, who looked beyond the incidental details of his subjects.This painting is the right wing of a diptych. The left wing - now in the Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino - represents the Virgin with Child.Philippe de Croy (1435-1511) was a member of the most distinguished Burgundian nobility; in 1457 he was chamberlain to Philip the Good, he was administrator of Hainault in 1456-1465, and finally, in 1473, he became a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He would have been about 25 in this portrait. Van der Weyden portrayed him as a refined and pious man. The fact that he is depicted at prayer supports the notion that this male portrait originally formed the right-hand part of a diptych"

37528-3present.jpg	In 1518 a new project brought together three Sienese painters, Sodoma, Beccafumi and Girolamo del Pacchia. The new project was a scheme of fresco paintings to embellish the interior of a meeting room belonging to one of the city's oldest confraternities - the Confraternity of Santa Maria degli Angeli della Veste Nera (Saint Mary of the Angels and of the Black Robes). Founded in honour of the Virgin after 1450 the confraternity also adopted Bernardino as one of their saints, adding his name to the confraternity's title. For this reason the room that painters decorated is now known as the Oratory of San Bernardino. Designed as a place where the members of the confraternity would meet to conduct both their collective devotions and their administrative business, the Oratory of San Bernardino offers a rare example of an early sixteenth-century decorative ensemble that has survived in almost its original form.On the side walls of the room there is a series of large-scale fresco paintings separated from one another by pilasters decorated with candelabra motifs. The paintings consist of narrative scenes from the life of the Virgin. Sodoma had been assigned the paintings of the Presentation of the Virgin and the Coronation. In his painting of the Presentation, Sodoma introduced many of the lavishly attired bystanders that are characteristic of his Monteoliveto frescoes. The architectural setting for the scene, however, appears to have been influenced by Raphael's fresco of the Expulsion of Heliodorus (1512) in the Stanza d'Eliodoro in the Vatican. The paintings depicts two sets of marble colonnades seen in sharp recession, thus providing a framework and focus for an important event taking place at some distance from the spectator. In the case of the confraternity painting, this is the crucial encounter between the young child and the High Priest at the high altar, which forms the focal point of the story of the Virgin's presentation in the Temple.

12451-s_tavern.jpg	Dusart was a Dutch genre painter and engraver, pupil and close friend of Adriaen van Ostade, whose style he followed. On Ostade's death Dusart inherited his pictures and completed a number of them.This tavern scene was executed in the manner of Ostade, in a somewhat more exquisite way. Compared with the destitute-looking peasant interiors seen in earlier works, this tavern is bright and well-arranged. The peasants are seen eating, drinking and enjoying themselves and they are more carefully dressed than the figures in earlier peasant scenes. Even the gestures of these peasants have been made to look distinguished, but the result is to make them more ordinary and less interesting than the figures in van Ostade's paintings

33285-venus_sa.jpg	This painting, which is quoted in an inventory of the collections of Emperor Rudolf II, must have been produced between 1602 and 1608, when Dirck de Quade van Ravesteyn is mentioned as a painter at the court of Prague.In Greek mythology, satyrs personified the spirits of untamed life that haunted forests and hills. Their half human, half bestial appearance is characterised by a human body with ram's feet and horns. They were known for their loose morals and frequently associated with nymphs whom they pursued eagerly. At the Renaissance, they are often depicted as a family, as if to tame the wildness that they incarnate. This tendency is clearly expressed here, where an adult and a child satyr carry Venus and Cupid, the latter recognisable by his bow and arrows and his quiver. However, the goddess of love and her son do not just tame, they totally dominate the satyrs which serve them as mounts. This fairly rare subject possibly illustrates a verse from Virgil's tenth Bucolic: Omnia vincit Amor; et nos cedamus Amori (Love conquers all; and let us yield ourselves to love).This strongly rhythmic composition, where Venus' superb, pale-coloured flesh contrasts and interweaves with the satyr's rough, muscular body, is typical of the at once erotic and intellectual climate that prevailed at the court of Prague. Between the figures we see a hare, a symbol of carnal love and lasciviousness. The artist takes pleasure in precisely rendering the different textures of the furs, the wings, the flowers, the hair. He also considerably enlarges the field of vision by creating a deep vista in the thick and mysterious forest.After devoting himself to small-sized religious pictures and painting the human figures in a number of architectural tableaux by Hans and Paul Vredeman de Vries, it would seem that Dirck de Quade van Ravesteyn tried his hand at large-sized paintings of mythological subjects, almost certainly under the influence of the major painters at the court of Prague, Bartholomeus Spranger, Hans von Aachen and Joseph Heintz. His female figures become more robust, the compositions simpler and landscapes appear. Decorative details, in particular jewellery, are less in evidence, whilst his brushwork is reduced to the bare minimum

37704-concert.jpg	The Musicians was undoubtedly Caravaggio's most frequently imitated musical painting. An impressive number of concerts by Caravaggesque painters were derived from it. Whereas the paintings by Caravaggio's earliest followers, those executed during the first two decades of the seventeenth century, adhere closely to the original and generally depict a chamber concert with musical scores, painting in later decades, especially by foreign artists, present scenes which are substantially different. The Concert by Lionello Spada belongs to this first category

05678-o_murph.jpg	"The painting represents the portrait of Louise O'Murphy, a young Irish woman who worked as Boucher's model and who, in 1753, was briefly the mistress of Louis XV. The artist does not present her as a Venus of classical beauty but portrays her instead in a provocative pose of unambiguously erotic persuasion as a sweet child-woman.In spite of the high esteem in which Boucher was held by the public of the day they frequently criticized the artificiality of his ""porcelain heads"" and his delicately coloured interiors. Here, too, his handling of colour is delicate in the extreme, creating a powdery surface with- out depth in which the hues are brought together by the use of white as a common ground. There are neither deep shadows nor sombre contrasts of light and shade. The white ground also takes the edge off the primary triad of red, yellow and blue, diluted here to discreet shades of pink, pale yellow and light blue. The unapproachable, aloof beauty is dethroned and a pretty little coquette is put in her place.The painting  is also known as the Back Nude of Mlle O'Murphy"

24512-raising.jpg	Both the events depicted in this fresco are recounted in the Acts of the Apostles: the healing of the cripple in Jerusalem (3: 1-10) and the raising of Tabitha in Joppa (9: 36 43). Masolino sets both events in the same town although they had actually taken place in different cities and at different times.This detail shows the right side of the fresco with the scene Raising of Tabitha.In the square there are two elegantly dressed characters, in the centre of the scene, who separate but also provide the link between the two miraculous events. The presence of these two figures, and also the characters depicted in the background in front of the houses, makes the two events look like normal everyday occunences in the life of a city. The square resembles a contemporary Florentine piazza and the houses in the background, although none of them is strictly speaking an accurate portrayal of an existing building, convey the idea of Florentine architecture, as we still know it today. Even the paving of the street, different from that of the square, is a note of pure realism: the cobblestones, decreasing in size as they recede., also serve to emphasize the perspective of the composition.And there are other elements which contribute to this description of everyday city life: the flower pots on the window sills, the laundry hanging out to dry,the bird cages, the two monkeys, the people leaning out of the windows to chat with their neighbours, and so on.In the past the loggia to the left had been considered by critics to be architecturally fragile and unconvincing. But now, thanks to the restoration, we can make out the structural elements: from the smooth capitals of the pilasters, to the red plaster inside the courts.And even in the righthand loggia, where the miracle. of the raising of Tabitha takes place, the classical, Albertian colour pattern of the surfaces and the entablatures increases the solidity of the architecture.Throughout the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, scholars attributed this fresco to Masaccio, until 1929 when it was re-attributed to Masolino. Some critics claimed that there were sections painted by Masaccio. In 1940 it was suggested that Masaccio was responsible for the entire architectural background of the scene, including the figures in the background. This theory was accepted by almost all later scholars.Since the restoration, now that the pictorial techniques can be clearly distinguished, we can rule out any intervention by Masaccio at all, at any rate in the actual execution

07220-canal508.jpg	Together with the Entrance to the Grand Canal: from the West End of the Molo, this view of the Piazza San Marco is thought to have been bought by the Earl of Carlisle, directly from Canaletto himself. Both works hung in Castle Howard in Yorkshire, one of the homes of the Carlisle family, until they were sold and presented to the National Gallery in Washington by Barbara Hutton in 1945.The Piazza is here shown as a lively centre of commerce; stallholders cluster round the flag staffs and are protected from the sun by large colourful parasols. From left to right an impressive view of the San Marco, the Doge's Palace and a view of the Bacino, forms a backdrop to their activity. From this vantage point the artist shows a clear view of horses of San Marco which are set above the main door of the church; they were later to become the subject of one of Canaletto's most inventive capricci (The Horses of San Marco in the Piazzetta, Royal Collection, Windsor)

18784-guard407.jpg	In this view of San Simeone Piccolo, Francesco Guardi depicted the same part of the Grand Canal as in its companion, the Grand Canal with Santa Lucia and the Scalzi (also in the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid), but seen here from another angle. The vantage point of the painter is no longer on one side or the other of the canal; rather, this view seems to have been taken from a boat on the water. The eye is led towards the left bank, dominated by the large brass dome of Santi Simeone e Giuda, generally called San Simeone Piccolo to distinguish it from San Simeone Profeta. In the left foreground are Palazzo Foscari-Contarini and Casa Adolo, while in the centre of the composition the bridge over the Rio della Croce and the church by the same name mark the bend in the Grand Canal toward the northwest. Santa Lucia can be seen on the right side, its faï¿½ade strongly foreshortened. Guardi sat with his back toward the house in the narrowing of the Grand Canal; to his right, just out of view, were the Scalzi and the Rio dell'Isola.Remarkably, in both this painting and its companion the quay on the opposite side of the canal describes a virtually identical curve, starting at the left edge of the image. By choosing a vantage point on the water, which allowed the houses on both banks of the Canal to be seen simultaneously, Guardi made the Grand Canal seem much broader in this picture than in its pendant. Given that one experiences a distinct sense of width once the narrow section of the canal near the Fondamenta Grotta is left behind, this effect, though exaggerated, is nonetheless justified

09423-summer.jpg	The present painting is a striking example of Thomas Sidney Cooper's skill as a painter of cattle. Furthermore, Cooper's work references the influence of the seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painters Paulus Potter and Albert Cuyp, who are known to have greatly inspired his work. Known as the English 'Paul Potter', Cooper was impressed by the Dutch master of the pastoral landscape. The influence of the work of Cuyp on Cooper can be appreciated in Cuyp's Young Herdsman with Cows. Cooper seems to appropriate elements of Cuyp's compositional structure by creating a vast sense of space by silhouetting the cattle against the sky.

37546-scene19.jpg	"Scene 19 of the cycle on the life of St Benedict depicts Benedict sending away the harlots that the monk Florentius sent into the monastery.According to the documents, Sodoma started working in the southwest corner of the cloister, his first painting was Scene 19, next to the last scene by Signorelli (Scene 20).The scenes  in which the community is confronted with a group of voluptuous women (Scene 19) and two of the brothers gorge themselves at a nearby inn (Scene 25) stand out with their brighter colours and rich details.The most scandalous episode Vasari includes in his discussion of Sodoma's stay at Monteoliveto Maggiore has to do with the picture showing the evil Florentius's attempt to corrupt his fellow monks (Scene 19). To expose the brothers to temptation, the sources tell us, Florentius sneaked seven naked harlots into the monastery. Vasari insists that Sodoma actually painted the women nude, hiding his picture from the eyes of the monks until it was finished. At its unveiling, the abbot was so enraged by Sodoma's affront to propriety that he demanded that the work be destroyed. The painter ultimately managed to appease him by agreeing to put clothes on the offending nudes. Although there is no evidence of such last-minute changes to the painting, the story may have a certain amount of truth to it, for the notion of ""seven naked girls"" comes straight from the Golden Legend"

34397-louis_14.jpg	"This famous portrait is regarded as the very epitome of the absolutist ruler portrait. Yet it represents more than just power, pomp and circumstance. The sumptuous red and gold drapery is not only a motif of dignity, but also creates a framework that echoes the drapes of the ornate, ermine-lined robe. The blue velvet brocade ornamented with the golden fleurs-delis of the house of Bourbon is repeated in the upholstery of the chair, the cushion and the cloth draped over the table below it: the king quite clearly ""sets the tone"".A monumental marble column on a high plinth is draped in such a way that it does not detract from the height of the figure. Louis is presented in an elegantly angled pose, situated well above the standpoint of the spectator to whom he seems to turn his attention graciously, but without reducing the stability of his stance.Rigaud's consummate mastery of portraiture is particularly evident in the way he depicts the king's facial expression: his distanced unapproachability are not founded in Neoclassicist idealization, but in the candour of an ageing, impenetrable physiognomy. The lips are closed decisively and with a hint of irony, the eyes have a harsh, dark sheen, while the narrow nose suggests intolerance. This is a ruler who is neither good nor evil, but beyond all moral categories."

He paints willowy women with oval faces, and with slightly slit eyes under long, puffed eyelids, whose somewhat affected manner calls to mind the art of his contemporary Memling.According to archive sources, the Virgin Surrounded by Female Saints was placed in 1489 in the church of the Our Lady in Bruges on the altar belonging to the rhetoric chamber named De drie Sanctinnen (the three female saints), and was therefore likely painted shortly before that date. The three saints in question are Catherine, Mary Magdalen and Barbara, all widely venerated in Bruges. They surround a Virgin and Child, forming the central group of the composition.The Virgin is represented as the Queen of Heaven. She wears a crown and is seated on a throne behind which two angels hold aloft a rich brocade honour cloth. The scene takes place in an enclosed garden, full of plants and flowers, evoking Paradise. A landscape extends far into the background. The eleven young women surrounding the Virgin can be identified by their various attributes accompanying them or decorating their rich garments. The Child is holding a ring to Catherine in order to seal their ""mystical marriage"". This saint is also accompanied by a sword and her mantle is decorated with wheels. Mary Magdalene can be recognised by her ointment pot and Barbara by the towers that decorate her brocade mantle and her necklace. To the left, Ursula is identified by the arrows of her martyrdom half hidden beneath her gown, Apollina by a tooth in a pair of pincers and Lucy by a tray with two eyes on it. An unidentified saint holds a crown and a bell. To the right, Agnes carries a lamb in her lap and presents a ring, signifying her mystical marriage with Christ. Cunera, a companion of Ursula, carries a little cradle or footstool, along with an arrow, and Agatha a pair of pincers holding a torn-off breast. Margaret holds a cross in her hand. She is also accompanied in the landscape by a representation of St George slaying the dragon, a scene with which she is frequently associated"

Here, the scarf ends hang down, serving to frame a face in  which we read force of character and upon which we can project an inner emotional life. Van Eyck's personage gives much less away. A greater area of the picture is taken up by his red hat than by his face, its three-dimensional bulk is more assertive, it folds and tucks more dramatic. Perhaps the hat was studied at greater length, perhaps on a stand, independently of the sitter and, like a studio still-life, arranged by the painter, knotted and tweaked to present its most picturesque aspect

09150-francois.jpg	Francis I (1494-1547) became king of France in 1515 while still a young man, and like the German emperor Charles V (emperor 1519-1556) and Henry VIII of England (king 1509-1547) he was always eager to present himself in a setting of great splendour. Clouet's portrait of Francis had an important role in this. In the unusually large Louvre portrait, Clouet shows Francis I in opulent Renaissance apparel; the traditional insignia of royal majesty were dispensed with, but crowns are woven in to the costly red damask behind the figure of the king.The painting is one of the masterpieces of Renaissance portraiture. The half length figure of the king is painted in front of a scarlet brocade background. His cap, studded with pearls, is encircled with white feathers. His magnificent black and white striped satin doublet is lavishly embroidered in gold. A medal of St Michael is suspended on a gold chain around his neck. His right hand, holding gloves, rests on a table with a green velvet cover; his left on a magnificently worked sword hilt. His narrowed blue eyes, his shrewd glance, his dark moustache and beard lend his face a singular attraction. The whole is a telling portrait of a sovereign who was an outstanding personality and a generous Renaissance patron of art

19400-goblet.jpg	The work of the Dutch still-life painters who appear around 1620 corresponds to the tonal trend of the landscapists of van Goyen's generation. Pieter Claesz and Willem Claesz. Heda, popularizers of the breakfast piece, are the principal representatives of this phase. Claesz, the father of the landscapist Nicolaes Berchem, was born at Berchem (probably the village near Antwerp). Heda's origins are obscure. Both were primarily active at Haarlem and underwent similar stylistic developments.Their early works show the influence of the older still-life painters, but they soon limited themselves to the description of a simple meal set near the corner of a table - some bread and cheese, a herring on a pewter dish, a glass of beer or wine, perhaps a silvery pewter vessel, and a white crumpled tablecloth - just enough to suggest a light breakfast or snack. These objects, which always look as if they had been touched by someone who is still close by, are no longer treated as isolated entities: they are grouped together, forming masses along a single diagonal axis. But more important, Pieter Claesz and Heda reacted to the comprehensive forces of light and atmosphere which envelop us and the things with which we live, and they found means to express their reactions to these forces as accurately, immediately, and intensely as possible. As a result, they seem to animate their simple subjects. With a new pictorial mode, they achieve a more dynamic spatial and compositional treatment.The foreground of their unpretentious arrangements becomes spacious, and there is clear recession. Instead of vivid local colours, monochromatic harmonies with sensitive contrasts of valeurs of low intensity are favoured, without, however, a loss of the earlier regard for textural differentiation. From the point of view of composition and of colouristic, tonal, and spatial treatment the perfectly balanced still-lifes by Claesz and Heda are among the most satisfying Dutch paintings made during the century.Claesz has a more vigorous touch than Heda. He was also a man of simpler tastes. Heda depicts oysters more frequently than herrings, and after 1640 his compositions became larger, richer, and more decorative. To obtain a more monumental effect, during his maturity Heda often abandons the traditional horizontal format for a vertical one. Ornate silver vessels and costly 'faï¿½on de Venise' glasses, at the time blown in the Netherlands as well as Venice, intensify the contrasts of valeurs, and touches of colour provided by the pink of sliced hams and ripe fruit are combined with an increased chiaroscuro

42182-capitol1.jpg	The Scuola del Santo in Padua, the house where the brotherhood of St Anthony met, was on the edge of the square in front of the church in which the famous Franciscan saint was buried. This lay confraternity united mainly traders, merchants and artisans who assembled for regular services and mutual social welfare. The Sala Capitolare served for the meetings of the male members, and the older room on the ground floor was allocated to the women. A lavish decoration of the upper hall was begun in 1508 with painted ornaments on the coffered ceiling. At the same time they added wood paneling, armoires, and benches that covered the lower part of the walls. The remaining surface of the walls above this was divided into fields by wooden pilasters, and beginning in 1509it was frescoed by various painters - in the tradition of the older 'scuola' decorations in Venice and Padua. Within a few years a cycle of at least twelve episodes from the life and work of St Anthony had been completed.The painters of the fresco decoration were Giovanni Antonio Requesta (known as Corona), Filippo da Verona, Tiziano Vecellio, Francesco Vecellio, Girolamo Tessari (known as Girolamo del Santo), Bartolomeo Montagna, and Domenico Campagnola. The room owes its fame in the history of Italian art to three of the paintings: the frescoes Titian produced for the brotherhood in 1511.Scenes with St Anthony are found on all four walls of the room. The history cycle paintings immediately to the left and right of the altar on the altar wall show Anthony using his eloquence for the well-being of Padua. In the left fresco he is seen soon after his arrival in Padua, preaching to establish peace among the citizens of the city; in the right painting he is calming and converting the tyrant Ezzelino, who represented a threat to Padua from outside. These frescoes were executed by Corona.To the left of the altar wall, on the long entrance wall, follows a series of miraculous cures by Anthony. The scenes are: The Miracle of the Jealous Husband (Titian); The Healing of the Wrathful Son (Titian); St Anthony Heals a Child who Has Fallen into Boiling Water (Girolamo del Santo, divided into two by the window); Resurrection of a Murdered Man (Bartolomeo Montagna); The Death of St Anthony (18th-century addition); Resurrection of a Drowned Girl (Domenico Campagnola); Resurrection of a Drowned Child (Domenico Campagnola).The end wall (opposite to the altar wall) shows the saint's three most famous miracles: The Miracle of the Newborn Child (Titian); The Miracle of the Miser's Heart (Francesco Vecellio); The Miracle of the Host (Francesco Vecellio).The right wall to the altar (the second long wall) depicts, between three windows, four events that took place only after the saint's death: St Anthony Appears to the Blessed Luca Belludi (Filippo da Verona); The Death of St Anthony (Girolamo del Santo); Recovery of the Relic of St Anthony's Jawbone (Bartolomeo Montagna); Miracle of the Glass (Girolamo del Santo).The photo shows the frescoes on the end wall. To the right beneath the narratives there is a fresco in the form of a trompe-l'oeil. To the side of the actual entrance door a guardian seems to be stepping through a painted door to distribute bread in front of a statue of Anthony. This immortalizes the brotherhood's practice of distributing consecrated bread to the members after masses in the Sala

The representation of everyday life in close proximity sacred elements can be interpreted both as a new aesthetic and as evidence of a more populist approach to Christianity. We can see Adam and Eve, the first couple, whose posture and subtly rendered nakedness make them seem more actual than the main subject, which takes up several panels. One might even describe these panels as scenes in the story of Adam and Eve because (from the standpoint of the observer) they are shown slightly elevated and walking towards the holy events. The undisguised pregnancy of Eve and Cains murder of Abel shown above her open the route to humanity's suffering - but also to God's grace and his willingness to sacrifice his own son, the ""Lamb of God,"" in order to fulfill his promise of redemption.

30554-stillife.jpg	Although American artists were interested in still life in the 18th century, they did not devote themselves to it until the 19th. James Peale, brother of the more prominent artist Charles Willson Peale, led in developing a Philadelphia school of still life. This masterpiece of the genre presents a lavish, colourful assortment of vegetables pyramidally arranged and carefully balanced without kitchen utensils or other man-made objects. Given the variety of textures and shapes depicted, it must be considered something of a tour de force

09831-drainage.jpg	John Sell Cotman belonged to the Norwich School of painters, founded by John Crome and Robert Ladbrooke in 1803 in Norwich. It was the first provincial art movement in Britain. Artists of the school were inspired by the natural beauty of the Norfolk landscape and owed some influence to the work of landscape painters of the Dutch Golden Age such as Hobbema and Ruisdael. The leading figure of the school was John Crome until his death in 1821. The society was kept together by John Sell Cotman until 1834 when Cotman left Norwich for London.

41395-12crucif.jpg	The painting is attributed to the school of Rimini, mainly because it can be compared to a polyptych in the Museo Civico in Rimini. It could have been an altarpiece for an altar dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene, who holds a prominent position in both parts of the panel.The panel is divided horizontally in two parts. On the top is the Crucifixion with Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and on the bottom are scenes of the Three Holy Women at the Sepulcher and Noli me tangere.Two types of angels are depicted in this panel. The angels around the cross are reminiscent of figures of angels created first by Giotto, such as the angels in the fresco of the Lamentation over the Dead Christ in the Scrovegni Chapel, Padua, or in the Stefaneschi Altarpiece at the Vatican. These angels are able to express emotions, in this case grief. The angel sitting on the tomb is different in appearance and size and is more distinguished than the angels around the Crucifixion. He has an active and important role in the scene, linking the two parts together. He is therefore depicted not light and ephemeral as the mourning angels at the top; and, in contrast to them, he has legs.The panel is divided horizontally in two parts.

25966-03crabb.jpg	The triptych has been dismantled at some stage in its history to allow the different panels to be sold individually. This occurred frequently from the eighteenth century onwards. The interior of the side panels are now in the The Morgan Library and Museum, New York. In view of the style and the continuous composition, there is no reason to doubt the linkage between these panels and the central panel in Vicenza. The exterior of the side panels, now in the Groeninge Museum, Bruges, depicts the Annunciation in grisaille.The triptych had been commissioned by Jan Crabbe, twenty-sixth abbot of Ter Duinen Abbey in Koksijde (1457-1488), to mark the occasion of his fifteenth anniversary as prelate in 1472. The other figures in the painting were identified as his mother Anna and his brother Willem. This identification is highly plausible in chronological terms as far as Jan Crabbe is concerned. Crabbe was the only Flemish Cistercian abbot with the first name Jan in Memling's time. The praying abbot here is indeed a Cistercian, and is protected by both St John the Baptist and St Bernard

06047-elijah.jpg	Elijah was a Hebrew prophet, a forceful character who vigorously opposed the cult of Baal among the Israelites. During a prolonged drought Elijah went to dwell by the brook Cherith which still ran.

31203-02bapti1.jpg	In 1442 Piero was recorded as town councillor in Borgo San Sepolcro. This painting is his first important commission in this period, originally it was painted for the Chapel of San Giovanni in the Pieve.The most striking feature of this painting is the extraordinary lighting from above, creating delicate pastel colours, with pale shadows that surround the figures and enhance their three dimensionality. At the centre, the figure of Christ is portrayed as a simple man, but his stance is so solemn as to make him look as majestic as a Greek god. His torso and his legs are circular and solid, like the tree on the left; the holy dove, like a little cloud, fits into a patch of sky amidst the foliage of the tree, rendered with almost Impressionistic strokes.The three angels on the left, with their pale but round faces, are reminiscent of the groups of children sculpted by Luca della Robbia for the Cantoria in Florence Cathedral (1432-38): and even their blonde hair, decorated with garlands, is clearly inspired by Luca's models. The face of the angel in the centre, with his fixed gaze, brings to mind Domenico Veneziano paintings in the mid-1430s

14902-early04.jpg	This painting shows the influence of the Impressionist painters on Gauguin. The striking lifesize study combined a number of technical strategies and was a major feature of the 1881 Impressionist show. The heavy flesh of this big-boned pregnant woman, together with her everyday task, share the realistic eye of Degas, while the still-life quality of the setting and the overall conception of the picture suggest Manet's approach. The fine brushwork of the nuanced colouring of light, and the blue and green shadows on the woman's skin, recall Renoir and even more Pissarro

37040-1antich1.jpg	It is quite likely that the Deeds of the Antichrist is intended as a reference to Savonarola, the Dominican friar hanged and burnt at the stake in Florence on 23 May 1498. In a 'Papist' city like Urbino, and in the case of an artist like Signorelli who had been a Medici protï¿½gï¿½ and who thought of himself basically as a victim of persecution from the Florentine democratic government (a fact we learn from Michelangelo), this identification of Savonarola with the Antichrist is very plausible; it is also supported by a famous passage in Marsilio Ficino's Apologia, published in 1498, where the Ferrarese monk is again identified as the false prophet.There is no doubt that Signorelli has given us a very convincing portrayal of the sinister and mysterious atmosphere evoked in the prophecies of the Gospels in the huge fresco showing the Sermon and Deeds of the Antichrist. Against a vast and desolate background, dominated on the right by an unusually large classical building, depicted in distorted perspective, the false prophet is shown disseminating his lies and spreading his message of destruction. He has the features of Christ, but it is Satan (portrayed behind him) who tells him what to say. The people around him, who have piled up gifts at the foot of his throne, have clearly already been corrupted by the iniquities the Gospel has warned us of. And, starting from the left, we have a description of a brutal massacre, followed by a young woman selling her body to an old merchant, and then more aggressive and evil-looking men. In the background of this scene all sorts of horrors and miraculous events are taking place. The Antichrist orders people to be executed and even resurrects a man, while a group of clerics, huddled together like a fortified citadel, resist the devil's temptations by praying. Lastly, to the left, Signorelli shows us how the age of the Antichrist is rapidly reaching its inevitable epilogue, with the false prophet being hurled down from the heavens by the Angel and all his followers being defeated and destroyed by the wrath of God.That this scene is the masterpiece of the whole cycle (at least in terms of originality of invention and evocation of fantastic imagery) even Signorelli himself must have realized, and he has placed himself, together with a monk (traditionally identified as Fra Angelico) on the left-hand side of the composition

26725-lu12sal.jpg	"""Nahshon begat Salmon. Salmon begat Boaz by Rahab. Boaz begat Obed by Ruth. Obed begat Jesse,"" (Matthew 1:4-5)On the basis of somewhat flimsy arguments, the figure on the right is usually held to be Boaz; his old age was, according to the Bible, gladdened by the birth of Obed, who is, therefore, depicted on the left with his mother, Ruth. The woman is represented with her eyes closed, as she tenderly cuddles the sleeping infant she has just finished nursing. A breast still protrudes from her clothing; in the past it was hidden beneath repainting, but the recent restoration has revealed it once again. She is wearing a long rose tunic with whitish highlights formed by the folds and orange shadows. A violet-rose mantle envelops her knees, while her head is covered with a cloth falling onto her shoulders. The green of this is duller in tone than that of the shawl wrapping the infant.The serenity and sweetness of the woman, seen frontally and slightly turned toward the center of the lunette, contrasts sharply - also due to the dominant colours - with the old man depicted in profile on the right. He is sitting with his right arm placed on the seat, perhaps because he is restraining himself. Hunched up, his lips parted, his long beard jutting out in front of him, he glares angrily at the staff he is holding in his outstretched hand. The top of the staff is carved in the shape of a small bearded head, with a fierce expression; bearing a strange resemblance to the man, it seems mock him. The harsh greenish-yellow of his short tunic, girt round the waist with a red sash, clashes violently with the rose of his hose. On his head he is wearing a cap with earflaps, while a white broad brimmed hat hang down his back. Together with the water-bottle dangling from his waist and the staff, this seems to suggest he is a pilgrim"

39900-1legacy.jpg	"""Legacy"" is the most important work of Tornyai. He never considered the first version of  the  picture to be final which was awarded with a Rï¿½th Gyï¿½rgy prize: he kept rethinking it all through his life in order to create it  in an artistic way  and to sum it up in  a ""serious picture"" before death would prevent him from doing so.The subject matter of ""Legacy"" is a  drama in a Hungarian village: a very poor peasant family is fighting  over how to divide their  almost valueless heritage. The scene is a room in a peasant house in Vï¿½sï¿½rhely, in the middle there is a long table with the family, grandfather, grown-up sisters, brother in law and a granddaughter sitting around it. Women are fiercely fighting  for morsels of the heritage on the mother's side. The dramatic atmosphere of the picture is largely due to Tornyai's composition, character portrayal  and colours. Emotional tensions emphasize  drama: the women's vehemence is contrasted with the old man sinking into himself  and other characters seemingly unconcerned.Munkï¿½csy's influence is reflected in the composition, psychology and colours of the picture but its dramatic expression, passionate brushwork, delicately tinted colours, bright colours and deep shadows recall the great  predecessor, too.

37241-10cloak.jpg	The first fresco depicts the famous episode of the Division of the Cloak, the story for which Martin is best known: having come across a beggar dressed in rags on a cold winter morning, Martin gave him half of his cloak.

To the right, in the upper section, a head: to try and justify this strange presence we must examine the synopia of the fresco in the Museum of the Basilica. Originally Simone had planned the composition differently: the beggar was shown with his arms outstretched towards the cloak and the city gate was on the opposite side. This helps us understand the position of this solitary profile, very close and parallel to the side frame. But then Simone changed his mind, covered the wall with another layer of intonaco, drew a new synopia and with a brushstroke of blue paint cancelled that first face which has now resurfaced

07692-rosso.jpg	"After an apprenticeship with Carlo Maratti in Rome, Carlone familiarized himself with Naples, Sicily, and Venice, before he began working as a fresco painter in Perugia and Rome.Beginning in 1678 he was given a number of commissions in Genoa, however, his main activity as a fresco painter continued to be in the Papal States and in Lombardy. His style, based on that of Maratti, represented an ""academic"" alternative  to the dynamic lyricism that was the trademark of the Piola workshop, the leading artists in Genoa.The Palazzo Brignole Sale (dubbed Palazzo Rosso because of the colour of its stucco exterior) was erected between 1671 and 1679 on the prestigious Strada Nuova (present-day Via Garibaldi) in Genoa. The decoration of the palazzo was accomplished in two phases. In 1687-89 the team of Domenico Piola and Gregorio de Ferrari - with the assistance of Niccol&#242; di Viviano Codazzi (1642-1693), Antonio Maria Haffner (1654-1732) and Sebastiano Monchi (c. 1630-1706) - painted the east wing, including the south loggia, then in 1691-92 the frescoes in the rooms of the west wing were executed by Giovanni Andrea Carlone with the assistance of Antonio Maria Haffner and Carlo Antonio Tavella (1668-1738). The quadratura painter Antonio Maria Haffner worked both for the Piola-Ferrari and Carlone teams.The picture shows the fresco on the ceiling of a room in the west wing, called the Sala della Vita Humana.

She represents one of the early types of half length figures of the Virgin, which were used in many pictures by Rogier's successors, and copied with what are often only very slight deviations. The head of Mary in particular recurs almost unchanged in many pictures from Rogier's workshop or by his close colleagues, and has come down to us, for instance, in a drawing that was intended as the model for a painting (Musï¿½e du Louvre, Paris).This panel of the Madonna formed a diptych with the portrait of Jean de Gros; both have the donor's motto and emblem on the back.

35746-winter_l.jpg	A survey of the large oeuvre of Jacob van Ruisdael reveals he painted virtually every subject depicted by Dutch landscapists: dunes and country roads, grainfields, panoramas, rivers and canals, woods and forests, ruins, winter scenes, water and windmills, city views, mountain scenes, Scandinavian landscapes, and seascapes and views of beaches as well.Ruisdael's winter landscapes are not the least remarkable in the oeuvre. In the first-rate example of one at Munich forbidding dark clouds hang over a forlorn snow-covered scene. There is no trace here of the gaiety of Avercamp's better known winterscapes and, unlike his, Ruisdaele's conjures up no image of skaters and other delights of the season. Its subject is a rarer one: the brooding mood of a winter day darkened by threatening clouds.

16161-chris19.jpg	The crucified Christ towers over the two groups of figures. Angels swarm around him with a great variety of reactions of grief and pain. Mary Magdalene has fallen at his feet, her cloak has slipped unnoticed from her shoulders - her delicately painted, superb head of hair is now her only adornment. His mother, the Virgin Mary, collapses in a faint, while on the other side the soldiers fight over Christ's mantle. The centurion has recognized Christ and is attempting to point him out to the others.Some of the most dramatic parts in the Crucifixion and the following Lamentation are played by the small angelic spirits, who appear to have the lower part of their bodies hidden by clouds, a much more effective solution than that devised for the angelic spirits at Assisi, whose bodies are merely truncated. These small beings communicate their almost savage desperation through an extraordinary variety of attitudes and facial expressions not given to their human counter parts

34114-padua1.jpg	The Scuola del Santo in Padua, the house where the brotherhood of St Anthony met, was on the edge of the square in front of the church in which the famous Franciscan saint was buried. This lay confraternity united mainly traders, merchants and artisans who assembled for regular services and mutual social welfare. The Sala Capitolare served for the meetings of the male members, and the older room on the ground floor was allocated to the women. A lavish decoration of the upper hall was begun in 1508 with painted ornaments on the coffered ceiling. At the same time they added wood paneling, armoires, and benches that covered the lower part of the walls. The remaining surface of the walls above this was divided into fields by wooden pilasters, and beginning in 1509it was frescoed by various painters - in the tradition of the older 'scuola' decorations in Venice and Padua. Within a few years a cycle of at least twelve episodes from the life and work of St Anthony had been completed.The painters of the fresco decoration were Giovanni Antonio Requesta (known as Corona), Filippo da Verona, Tiziano Vecellio, Francesco Vecellio, Girolamo Tessari (known as Girolamo del Santo), Bartolomeo Montagna, and Domenico Campagnola. The room owes its fame in the history of Italian art to three of the paintings: the frescoes Titian produced for the brotherhood in 1511.Scenes with St Anthony are found on all four walls of the room. The history cycle paintings immediately to the left and right of the altar on the altar wall show Anthony using his eloquence for the well-being of Padua. In the left fresco he is seen soon after his arrival in Padua, preaching to establish peace among the citizens of the city; in the right painting he is calming and converting the tyrant Ezzelino, who represented a threat to Padua from outside. These frescoes were executed by Corona.To the left of the altar wall, on the long entrance wall, follows a series of miraculous cures by Anthony. The scenes are: The Miracle of the Jealous Husband (Titian); The Healing of the Wrathful Son (Titian); St Anthony Heals a Child who Has Fallen into Boiling Water (Girolamo del Santo, divided into two by the window); Resurrection of a Murdered Man (Bartolomeo Montagna); The Death of St Anthony (18th-century addition); Resurrection of a Drowned Girl (Domenico Campagnola); Resurrection of a Drowned Child (Domenico Campagnola).The end wall (opposite to the altar wall) shows the saint's three most famous miracles: The Miracle of the Newborn Child (Titian); The Miracle of the Miser's Heart (Francesco Vecellio); The Miracle of the Host (Francesco Vecellio).The right wall to the altar (the second long wall) depicts, between three windows, four events that took place only after the saint's death: St Anthony Appears to the Blessed Luca Belludi (Filippo da Verona); The Death of St Anthony (Girolamo del Santo); Recovery of the Relic of St Anthony's Jawbone (Bartolomeo Montagna); Miracle of the Glass (Girolamo del Santo).The photo shows the entrance wall with two of Titian's frescoes and the left side of the altar wall with St Anthony Preaching by Corona

33505-10portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 161.The portrait Maurits Huygens (1595-1642) was painted as a near-companion piece to one of the painter Jacob de Gheyn III. Maurits was the brother of Constantijn Huygens, while Jacob de Gheyn was a childhood friend of Constantijn with whom he traveled to England in 1618 on an art pilgrimage.The sitters of the companion-pieces performed a rare sentimental gesture in 1632. They both had their portrait painted by Rembrandt in two panels of the same smallish size. Apparently they agreed that each would keep his own portrait and that the first to die would leave it to the other. The portraits were reunited in 1641 after the death of de Gheyn, who was outlived by his friend for only half a year

08433-evening.jpg	"Ceruti was Milanese by birth but chose to live in Brescia. He was one of the most interesting Lombard painters of the eighteenth century but his output is very varied and patchy. In his altarpieces and religious paintings he seems unsure of himself, but in his portraits he could be penetratingly intense. In his works about the poor, he sometimes bordered on genius and gave rise to a new genre in painting. No one before him, not even Caravaggio, had ever portrayed with such moving grandeur the rejected of this earth, those whom the Italians call the ""pitocchi"" (hence Ceruti's nickname Pitocchetto, the Little Miser).The tradition of ""painting from reality"" spanned several centuries and was an authentic and deep aspect of Lombard art, where Ceruti's place is crucial both for its stylistic and moral importance. In the middle of a century too often written off as frivolous and superficial, Ceruti painted little seamstresses, washerwomen, errand boys and idiots, stragglers and the destitute. In doing so, he sounded a note of humanity that is still heart-touching. The characters in these street ballads are portrayed nobly. Ceruti's brush explores their souls and melds them with the dull and dark colours of their clothes. It is thanks to Ceruti that we have a different, disenchanted but moving image of the eighteenth century"

43598-02presen.jpg	Simon Vouet arrived in Paris in 1627, having already pursued a successful career in Rome. His art seems to have appealed immediately to Louis XIII, who gave him more commissions than he accorded other artists. Vouet's main achievement was in  bringing a fully developed Baroque style back from Italy, which shows his extraordinary ability to change direction: he had been totally preoccupied with Caravaggism in his Roman years. He must, however, have been absorbing all the fashionable trends in Rome (Caravaggism had already become old-fashioned among Italian painters in the 1620s), and he was able to bring them almost unadulterated to the court of Louis XIII.The Parisian court's preoccupation with foreign styles of painting was already obvious, and Vouet, although a Frenchman, found that he could provide an up-to-date approach to what the court wanted without any local rivals. The combination of Italian influences is seen to perfection in his Presentation in the Temple, one of the most Baroque of all Vouet's compositions, given by Cardinal Richelieu to the Jesuit church in Paris. Only certain of the facial expressions suggest that the picture might not be Italian. In scale and composition it is a flawless altarpiece of the type then being commissioned for newly decorated or reconstructed churches all over Rome. The main influences in the picture are derived from the cool order of Domenichino and the much softer, more sensual approach of Guido Reni, and in it Vouet reached the level of accomplishment found in the work of Orazio Gentileschi, who had been working successfully for the Parisian court for two years

16997-nuenen12.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 156, JH 569.In December 1884 van Gogh set himself the task of painting and drawing a large series of portraits of the peasants in Brabant. In this group of works he did not want to portray individuals but sought to characterize a type: the peasant. Rather than seeking beauty, he was looking for models that had rough, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips.The present bust-length portrait is a good example of the type of portraits van Gogh was envisioning. It shows a woman with heavy features dressed in a white cap and blue jacket typical for the peasant women of the time and region. Van Gogh appreciated the opportunity of painting the white caps of the women which he found difficult to do but extremely beautiful.

The location where it has been hidden can be learned only with the compelled assistance of a Jew named Judas. As the Cross is unearthed, the crosses of the two thieves are also discovered. The True Cross is identified when a dead youth who is being carried past on a bier is brought to life again after the three crosses, one after the other, are laid over him.The order in which the images are to be read differs from that in the other frescoes: the recovery of the crosses is shown at the right, and on the left is the identification of the True Cross.

11020-414david.jpg	David had begun the Leonidas at Thermopylae in 1798 as a companion piece to The Intervention of the Sabine Women. However, it was completed much later, in 1814.The subject concerns Leonidas, King of Sparta, who in 480 BC held the pass at Thermopylae against the invading Persian army of Xerxes. Vastly outnumbered, Leonidas and his 300 handpicked volunteers were killed, but only after their heroic defence had ensured the safe retreat of the Greek fleet. In the final painting, as the sentinel trumpeters sound the call to arms, on the right two soldiers rush to gather their weapons that are hanging from the branches of an oak tree. Leonidas sits on a rock facing out at the viewer, contemplating his and his soldiers' fate. Seated at his right is Agis, his wife's brother, who looks to his commander for orders. To emphasize the fervent patriotism of the Spartans, David once again includes an oath, and behind Leonidas three young soldiers lift up wreaths above two altars dedicated to Hercules and Aphrodite.On either side of Leonidas are two very young warriors, hardly more than boys, one of whom ties his sandal, while the other bids a last farewell to his aged father. Leonidas had tried to send the two young men away from the battle under the pretext of carrying a message, but they had refused to go. It is perhaps this undelivered scroll that is partially visible at Leonidas' feet; it reads in Greek, 'Leonidas, son of Anaxandrides, King to the Gerousia (Spartan Council of Elders). Greetings.' The final sacrifices having been made, all these men are ready to die for the glory of Sparta and in the background the baggage train departs with the possessions they will no longer need in this world. At the top left the soldier climbs the rock to inscribe the poignant message with the pommel of his sword

41417-21month1.jpg	An exceptional secular fresco cycle of the Months (only eleven from the twelve) survived in the Eagle's Tower of the Castello del Buonconsiglio in Trent. The dimension of the room is 6 x 5,8 m. The height of the frescoes is 3 m, the draped fabric painted below replaces the original wainscoting, which was painted with a sequence of niches.During the Gothic period a secular ruler would have preferred to have his residence decorated with tapestries rather than frescoes. While tapestries could provide desirable insulation during the winter months, more important was the impact they made because of their value. Because tapestries were much more expensive than frescoes, they could convey to the guests the wealth, therefore the power, of their host.

18291-1006grec.jpg	The painting obviously represents a king, since all the royal attributes are present - crown, sceptre with fleur-de-lys, and 'main de justice'; he wears modern armour, except for the fact that the forearms are bare. The column, no doubt, symbolizes the might of the warrior. The night landscape under moonlit clouds in the background, recently revealed during cleaning in 2000, is reminiscent of El Greco's representations of Toledo in the late 1590s.Various identifications of the principal figure have been made: Ferdinand V, the Catholic, King of Castile and Aragon, conqueror of Granada, who drove the Moors from Spain; St Louis, King of France; Ferdinand III, the saintly King of Castile and Leï¿½n, famous for his victories over the Moors. Others regard it as a secular portrait representing a victorious king of Spain - a Visigothic king, one of the sovereigns already mentioned, or Alfonso VI of Castile and Leï¿½n, the conqueror of Toledo in 1085. Presently it is accepted that the painting represents St Louis, King of France.There is an inferior replica, without the page, in Madrid, it is attributed to El Greco's son.An X-ray photograph made in the Louvre laboratories shows that the head of the page was at first painted more realistically, and subsequently idealized; the eyes were originally shown wide open, then El Greco lowered the eyelids to make the boy more subsidiary to the main figure.The predominantly glaucous tone of the picture and the curiously melancholic expression of the warrior king contribute to the quality of strangeness in this work

21708-blacksmi.jpg	The Reims Venus and the Forge are close in style, in the latter the artist simply removed Venus and painted a straightforward genre picture in which he could concentrate on the most sympathetic rendering of men working in a forge.The smith himself looks towards the spectator as if he has been disturbed by the artist and asked to hold the pose while a photograph is taken. The other figures look in different directions, exactly as a group of people will do today when caught unawares by the camera. Especially perceptive is the depiction of the seated old man on the right - he is staring into space exactly as many old people tend to do, particularly when they are preoccupied with something which is not part of the event in front of them. The gazes of the three children are alert but lacking the concentration of the adults. Thus the painters of this picture have observed, for the first time in French painting, a 'slice of life'.The depiction of the better-off peasantry is interesting from a sociological point of view because there are so few renderings of that class, but, even more important, it showed that masterpieces could be produced from humble material. This realistic treatment of 'low' subjects was not to be found again in French art until Courbet in the nineteenth century

42897-2ceilin2.jpg	The colourful fresco decoration of the Villa Barbaro reaches its climax in the Sala dell'Olimpo. The ceiling shows Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Venus, Mercury and Diana, the seven gods of the sky, gathered around the figure of a woman riding a headless snake, who has been interpreted, inter alia, as an allegory of divine wisdom. As Richard Cocke has explained, however, it could be Thalia, who in conjunction with the eight muses of the transept and the gods of the sky illustrates the real theme of the dome fresco, i.e. the harmony of the spheres. The adjacent pictorial fields in the octagon illustrate the elements of fire, earth, water and air, represented by figures of the gods Vulcan, Cybele, Neptune and Juno.

42085-03immacu.jpg	This is certainly one of the most accomplished paintings of a religious subject produced by Vasari, in spite of its being complicated by allegorical symbols composed with the help of contemporary intellectuals. The group of Mary transported by small angels is certainly the result of Vasari's reflections on the works of Raphael, which he saw in Rome. The allegorical group in the lower part of the painting, on the other hand, is inspired by Michelangelo's dramatic dynamism, while he draws on Rosso for the contorted poses of the numerous figures.This allegorical academicism, however, is diluted in the misty atmosphere, and in a general pictorial effect of extraordinary quality.This small painting displayed in the Gallery is the replica of a large work which Vasari executed in 1540 for the chapel of Bindo Altoviti in the Florentine church of SS. Apostoli

34711-battle.jpg	The present decoration of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Palazzo Ducale was realized after the disastrous fire of 1577 during which all the structures of the ship's-keel Gothic ceiling and the wall-paintings were destroyed. An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings. The canvases were dedicated, thematically, to the Glorification of Venice, in remembrance of the numerous military undertakings in the East or on the mainland by the Venetian ground troops. On the ceiling great importance was given to the victories of the Venetian army in conquering the mainland; along the wall to the dispute between Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa, who reached an agreement in Venice with the political mediation of Doge Sebastiano Ziani; and to the events of the Fourth Crusade, led by Doge Enrico Dandolo in the early years of the 13th century.Domenico Robusti's Battle of Salvore belongs to the series on the wall depicting scenes related to the dispute between Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa. It depicts an imaginary episode of the struggle between Pope Alexander III and Emperor Frederick Barbarossa for the investiture: the battle would have taken place between the victorious Venetian and the Imperial fleets. In reality the two personages met in Venice, under the auspices of Doge Ziani, to discuss peace

He endeavoured to create a clear visual language that would appeal to the spectator's mind and affect him rationally rather than through the emotions His oeuvre is one of the supreme expressions of classicism in French art. The subject of the Inspiration of the Poet remains under discussion: it is possible that the young man on the right, being inspired by Apollo, is Virgil, and the figure standing on the left Calliope, muse of epic poetry. In both figures there are distinct references to antique sculpture, as so often in Poussin's work, and the golden light shows the influence of the great Venetian painters of the sixteenth century.The appearance of the muse Calliope has led to the suggestion that the picture was painted in honour of a recently dead poet

32313-11annunc.jpg	For a long time there was speculation as to whether Poussin's Annunciation possibly arose in connection with his involvement - documented in contemporary letters - on the design of Cassiano dal Pozzo's tomb. In view of the simple and at the same time austere monumentality of the picture, identified as a work by Poussin by an illusionistically painted wood panel, it seems suitable as an altarpiece for a burial chapel. But dal Pozzo was not given such a chapel, and hence it now seems more likely that the painting represents a commission issued by Flavio Chigi, who in 1655 was made a Cardinal by Pope Alexander VII - also prominently named on the painted wooden panel

They were probably positioned on the second storey of the altarpiece, possibly either side of the Crucifixion now in the Prado.There are, however, certain passages in this painting that suggest overpainting or finishing by another hand (Jorge Manuel's?), which could point to a separate contract for this pair of paintings for the college. He was late in finishing the commission and there were difficulties in collecting moneys from the College - was the last of the series left unfinished, and completed later by his son?

As it happened, the wood was not suitable for this purpose, so his workers laid the hewn log across a stream to serve as a bridge. As the Queen of Sheba passed by on her visit to the wise Solomon, she came to the bridge and foresaw that one day the world's saviour would hang from this beam. She therefore refused to step on it, and instead knelt  before it in veneration.Behind the Queen of Sheba, kneeling in adoration, is her retinue of aristocratic ladies in waiting, with their high foreheads (according to the fashion of the time) emphasizing the round shape of their heads and the cylindrical form of the neck. Their velvet cloaks softly envelop their bodies, reaching all the way to the ground. The almost perfect regularity of the composition is underlined by the two trees in the background, whose leaves hover like umbrellas above the two groups of the women and of the grooms holding the horses. And yet Piero's constant attention to the regularity of proportions and the construction according to perspective never gives way to artificially sophisticated compositions, schematic symmetries or anything forced

07929-venus_ad.jpg	"It seems likely that Annibale and his brother Agostino both trained in their cousin Ludovico Carracci's studio. The three certainly worked together on a number of occasions but it was soon apparent that Annibale was the real genius among them, with the potential to become one of the greatest reformers in the history of painting. From his debut with a Crucifixion, Bologna, S. Maria della Carit&#224;, 1583, Annibale looked determined to reject the aridly cerebral and cold formulas of the Mannerists. Well-spent study tours around 1585 allowed Annibale to master the Renaissance Grand Manner of Titian and Correggio, especially their use of colour, but he rediscovered it in a modernized way. The foundation of the ""Accademia dei Desiderosi"" was of paramount importance to art as it signaled their belief that classical contemporary painting could still be taught. All the Carracci stressed the importance of drawing from life (all three were brilliant graphic artists), which was to be a hallmark of the Bolognese School they founded. In about 1595 both the Academy and the Carracci cousins' activity physically moved to Rome. This was in official recognition of the movement of artistic reform they had started and then taken right to the very heart of artistic debate. Thanks chiefly to them, Rome became the leading centre of the latest ideas and experiments in art in the seventeenth century"

38224-4fountai.jpg	Matthias Corvinus (1443-1490), also called the Just in folk tales, was King of Hungary (as Matthias I) and Croatia from 1458, at the age of 14 until his death. After conducting several military campaigns he became also King of Bohemia (1469-1490), and Duke of Austria (1486-1490). With his patronage Hungary became the first European country which adopted the Renaissance from Italy. As a Renaissance ruler, he established education institutions, patronized art and science, and introduced a new legal system in the Kingdom of Hungary. In the era of his kingship, Matthias strongly endeavoured to follow the model and ideas of the philosopher-king as described in Plato&#146;s Republic.The Matthias Fountain is a monumental fountain group in the western forecourt of Buda Castle, Budapest. It is a Neo-Baroque work by Alajos Strï¿½bl.The group depicts a hunting party led by Matthias Corvinus, the king of Hungary. The bronze figures are standing on heaps of rocks against the backdrop of the northern faï¿½ade of the former Castle Church. Water is running down between the cracks of the boulders. The whole theatrical arrangement bears resemblance to the famous Trevi Fountain in Rome although it is on a much smaller scale.The monumental facade behind the fountain is flanked by two pairs of giant Corinthian columns. The original balustrade crowning and the Mansard roof was richer in details but it was simplified after the second world war. The central niche forms a triumphal arch which is decorated with King Matthias' personal coat of arms. King Matthias is standing on the highest rock in hunting attire. He is holding a crossbow in his right and a huge stag lies dead at his feet. On the lower rocks a henchman blows his horn and the leader of the hunting group rests sitting on a boulder with his back towards the viewer. Three hounds complete the central group.There are two more bronze figures on the sides of the basin. They are connected to the central group with gestures and gazes but they have their own plinths. On the right is Szï¿½p Ilonka (Helen the Fair), heroine of a famous 19th century ballad by Mihï¿½ly Vï¿½rï¿½smarty. The girl is looking towards the king protecting her tame fawn from the hunters. On the right is the Italian chronicler, Galeotto Marzio who lived in King Matthias court. A dog lies at his feet and a falcon sits on his arm

39698-05sacre.jpg	Sacred and Profane Love, Titian's masterpiece, was painted when he was about twenty-five to celebrate the marriage of the Venetian Nicol&#242; Aurelio (coat of arms on the sarcophagus) and Laura Bagarotto in 1514. The bride dressed in white sitting beside Cupid is assisted by Venus in person. The figure with the vase of jewels symbolizes `fleeting happiness on earth' and the one bearing the burning flame of God's love symbolizes `eternal happiness in heaven'. The title is the result of a late 18th-century interpretation of the painting, which gives a moralistic reading of the nude figure, whereas the artist intended this to be an exaltation of both earthly and heavenly love. In fact in the Neoplatonic philosophy that Titian and his circle believed in contemplating the beauty of the creation led to an awareness of the divine perfection of the order of the cosmos.In this painting of love in the open countryside Titian has surpassed the delicate lyrical poetry of Giovanni Bellini or Giorgione and attributes a classical grandeur to his figures. In 1899, the Rothschilds offered to buy this world famous work at a price that was higher than the estimated value of the Villa Borghese and all its works of art (4,000,000 Lire as opposed to 3,600,000 Lire) . However, Titian's Sacred and Profane Love has remained and virtually become the symbol of the Borghese Gallery itself

06516-01navalb.jpg	"We do not know when and where this important painting was obtained, but Camillo Pamphilj was a great admirer of this dynasty of Flemish painters. A Creation of the World, evidently to be identified with the following picture, was already in his possession before 1654. In that year he acquired some other works from Mme. de Belleville in Paris: ""in view of the singular desire, that I had to accompany them with others in one of my cabinets owing to the esteem in which I hold that master of sign, from the imitation of whose style I cannot hold myself back...,"" wrote the prince to the Apostolic Delegate of Paris. Finally , in 1656 he got hold of another small picture: might this have been the Battle? After the death of Don Camillo, in 1666, the numerous paintings by the Brueghels that he had assembled as a result of this passion were hung in the second room adjoining the gallery of the palace in Piazza Navona. Among them was this painting, with a precious ebony frame. In 1669, another ten pictures, considered generically to be the work of ""Brugolo Vecchio,"" were acquired in Villa Ludovisi: two Landscapes (one on panel and the other on canvas), along with another four paintings on panel and the same number on copper. Today the collection contains fifteen paintings (ten in the Gallery and five in the Apartments) in memory of this passion for collecting, which was shared by the Borromeo and Colonna families as well.Pieter Bruegel the Elder, one of the greatest painters of all time, came to Italy in 1551 and 1553 in the company of the famous geographer Abraham Ortelius, visiting Messina, Naples, and Rome. It was undoubtedly in this period that the artist, probably at the request of his friend, made a number of drawings of topographical interest, which he took home with him. It is likely that among them was the drawing representing a Naval Battle in the Straits of Messina, which served as a model for an engraving by Frans Huys in 1561. Measuring 43,8 x 72 cm, its size is almost exactly the same as this painting, although the latter's unpainted edges have been cut off on all four sides. The veduta must date from around the same time, probably between 1560 and 1562 although a number of scholars believe it to have been painted around 1558. Unfortunately there is little evidence for a more precise date. It may be deduced that the painting was also based on a drawing of the same size and that the two compositions, stylistically similar, were intended as companion pieces, the first with the strait dominated by Etna and the second with the gulf overshadowed by Vesuvius. In any case both Battles are examples of artistic license, and not based on actual historical events, just as the semicircular form of the wharf in the View of Naples is a topographically inaccurate invention by the painter.The depictions of the two volcanoes, which lead one to meditate on the mysterious and universal force of nature, reflect the artist's Neoplatonic pantheism, based on the belief that the Divine animates the world from within. This is expressed in the encyclopedic and profound observation to be found in his pictures, in which human activity is in continuous, predestined movement. The painting is a sort of 'teatrum mundi,' that also embraces this image of Naples, seen from above and far way, in which the foaming crests of the waves, driven by the wind, advance vertically (!) toward the shore, in a brilliant and courageous use of perspective."

17137-arles59.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 498, JH 1635.In early December 1888 van Gogh began a pair of pendant paintings of chairs, Gauguin's and his own. These pictures are not just still-lifes, however much the iconography is reminiscent of the allegorical use of motifs in seventeenth-century Dutch still-life. The flame of a candle, for instance, is a commonplace in these, symbolizing light and life. But these paintings are also oblique portraits. On Gauguin's chair van Gogh has placed two books, recognizable from the colour of their covers as contemporary French novels. On his own chair he has placed a pipe and a tobacco pouch, and in the background there are sprouting onions. Gauguin's Chair is a night scene; his own, a daylight scene.There is a further level of connotation in this pair of paintings. In 1883 van Gogh told his brother of a story he had read about the English novelist Charles Dickens and the illustrator Luke Fildes. When Dickens died Fildes made a drawing which was reproduced in The Graphic, an illustrated periodical whose engravings van Gogh collected. The drawing showed Dickens's workroom and now empty chair. Van Gogh explained to his brother what this image signified for him. He saw it as a symbol of the loss, through death, of the great pioneers of literature and graphic illustration. Moreover these men - especially the illustrators, who had created images to accompany and illustrate modern literature - had, so van Gogh believed, worked in a collaborative and communal spirit. Their artistic community and shared endeavours provided van Gogh with a model for his own dream of a new co-operative society of artists, based on the Studio of the South, which had been initiated by Gauguin's arrival in Arles

In 1780 he had the artist paint a life-size portrait of himself in a park landscape. When the portrait of his wife followed in 1787, Gainsborough once again chose the landscape situation, but had recourse to a classical Urania pose.Lady Bate-Dudley is leaning against a garden monument with her legs crossed. The extended index finger of her left hand is touching her temple, a graceful, relaxed pose. In England, a natural form of dress had already by now become usual. Flowing around the body is a diaphanous veil which covers her coiffure. Her hair itself is no longer powdered, while skirts were only slightly ""upholstered"" and fabrics were allowed to fall loosely and playfully. The decollete was smaller, the bodice less rigid, and there was only a shawl about the hips. This new naturalness is the hallmark of Lady Bate-Dudley's portrait. Gainsborough creates a virtuoso combination of this natural portraiture and the trees and shrubs of the garden ambience. The ensemble is supported by the interplay of the distant light with the close-up illumination. Lady Bate-Dudley appears as her own source of light in the picture"

In its place came simple images with an obvious flow of them, free of mysteries or complications. Sacred episodes were set in the context of everyday reality. This can be seen from the way Barocci includes the Ducal Palace at Urbino in the background of this altarpiece in the Coli-Pontani Chapel of S.

Beham, who trained in Nuremberg before moving to the Bavarian court in Munich, presented him full face, attentively watching something or someone on the viewer's side of the picture plane. He writes numbers in chalk on the wooden table, perhaps tallying the changing scores of a game in progress. The picture's date is marked in the lower left. Beham opted for a frontal pose yet one that creates depth through its diagonal movement. The artist worked throughout to establish a realistic and highly tactile space. In the reflection in the eyes, in the glint of light on the sword handle and in the transparency of the wine glass, Beham recorded the presence of a window behind the viewer. Beham conscious manipulation of figure and space anticipates Jan Vermeer, Carel Fabritius and other Baroque masters

40797-nativit.jpg	The painter is referred to as the Master of the Vyssi Brod (Hohenfurth) Carrying of the Cross. This master was the most attractive and most gifted South-Bohemian painter of the third decade of the 15th century. (This master is not identical with the more famous Master of Hohenfurth, active in 1350-70 in Prague.)The miraculous event is represented in a scene of many figures, including Joseph, the Virgin Mary and the group of angels adoring the Child, as well as the shepherds listening to the heavenly message behind the stable. As a sign of the new times and increased demand for realism, space construction has grown more intricate, the building is less like scenery and the picture is crowded with figures. Congestion is enhanced by the great number of characters, many animals, and the scroll containing glorifying words. All these are, however, marked by a cool, distinguished restraint, conforming to the pictorial concepts which ruled in the early decades of the century. This restraint radiates from the faces of the protagonists, perhaps still more clearly from those of the angels; it is intensified by the colouring and conveyed by the treatment of the garments. The folds of the Virgin's cloak and those of the draperies hung over the beam seem to radiate coldness

35272-61galeri.jpg	In 1528 Francis I, King of France, decided to replace the Gothic hunting lodge at Fontainebleau, southeast of Paris, with a fitting palace. The heart of the new palace is the Gallery of Francis I, a grand ceremonial space with elegant decoration designed by Rosso Fiorentino. Between 1534 and 1539, Rosso, Primaticcio, and a team of artists created a programme that was visually and iconographically unprecedented in northern Europe. Rosso was in charge of the paintings, Primaticcio and his assistants executed the stucco caryatids, putti, garlands and other framing motifs.

29283-215muril.jpg	This is a particularly beautiful work from Murillo's late period. Over the decades, Murillo's painting became increasingly delicate and gossamer-like as the boundaries between his forms progressively dissolved. In this last phase of his creative production, he applies paint so thinly in places that the structure of the underpainting can clearly be seen. The white of the swaddling clothes has been given more strength, although the painter was not concerned here about creating a unified surface and simply placed one brush stroke directly beside the next. A delicate hint of pink shimmers on the Virgin's cheeks, and the pink of her fingers makes them stand out from the more pallid flesh tones of the infant Jesus. The subject has been reduced to its essence and the colours restricted to a few basic tones, although the effect of Mary's cloak has been spoilt by the changes that take place in blue pigments over time. The neutral background and the child's gaze, which appears to have moved spontaneously from its mother to a visitor who has suddenly entered, heighten the work's sense of intimacy.Murillo's Madonna was pierced by several bullets during the revolutionary unrest of May 1849. X-rays and the circular craquelure around the bullet holes confirm that these reports should not be dismissed as mere legends. The holes, which immediately afterwards were patched and retouched, are at the end of Mary's right thumb, to the left above her headscarf, and to the left in the background. The painting's present state is due to restoration work carried out in 1970

28609-1north3.jpg	Monet was a successful caricaturist in Le Havre, but after studying plein-air landscape painting, he moved to Paris in 1859. He soon met future Impressionists Camille Pissarro and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Renoir and Monet began painting outdoors together in the late 1860s, laying the foundations of Impressionism. In 1874, with Pissarro and Edgar Degas, Monet helped organize the Sociï¿½tï¿½ Anonyme des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs, etc., the formal name of the Impressionists' group. During the 1870s Monet developed his characteristic technique for rendering atmospheric outdoor light, using broken, rhythmic brushwork. Throughout his career, he remained loyal to the Impressionists' early goal of capturing the transitory effects of nature through direct observation. In 1890 he began creating paintings in series, depicting the same subject under various conditions and at different times of the day. His late pictures, made when he was half-blind, are shimmering pools of colour almost totally devoid of form

09380-salisbu2.jpg	Constable in his day was the preeminent painter of the English landscape, and although he never achieved the overwhelming success of his contemporary Turner, his naturalist's vision had far greater impact on the history of 19th-century painting. In 1822 John Fisher, bishop of Salisbury, commissioned from Constable a view of Salisbury Cathedral. The bishop rejected the canvas, which is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, because it had a stormy sky, and the artist painted a highly finished variant with a bright sky in 1826. The latter is now in the Frick Collection, New York.

23083-crucifi.jpg	The picture shows one of the scenes from the life of Christ painted by Pietro Lorenzetti on the vault of the south arm of the western transept of the Lower Church. This scene is much larger than the others of the series, it occupies the east wall.On this wall Pietro created an epic staging of Golgotha. The crosses are set against an enormous void of deep blue, with Christ, more than life-size, arching over our heads. This is the most ambitious of all pre-Renaissance crowd scenes; it comprises some fifty figures, each strongly differentiated. The hill presents a vast, crowded panorama: the familiar cast of the disciples and followers are grouped around the swooning Madonna, but they are all in turn encircled by mounted soldiery. The soldiers, raised up, dominate the crowd, embodying a whole spectrum of responses - ranging from the two smiling friends on the left, their horses engaged in animated flirtation, to the dramatically silhouetted centurion, Longinus, already haloed in the moment of his conversion

In these late pictorial essays the problems of colour, space and texture, which had been so troublesome and unsatisfactory when he had first taken up such subjects, have been resolved.The motif from which this painting was made is the plain outside Auvers. It could as easily be Provence or Brabant; there is nothing specific about it. It tells us nothing particular about Auvers or its population and their ways of life or work. But by the organization of its colour, the combination of perspectives in the close foreground and the receding middle and far distance, the painting invites the spectator to contemplate fields, clouds, trees and haystacks, held pleasantly and harmoniously together, potentially extending beyond the limits of the frame to surround him or her

41989-crowning.jpg	During the first decades of the 17th century, painting in France was still dominated by Mannerist tendencies. A number of young French artists who travelled to Rome to study, however, came under the influence of Caravaggio's naturalism and tenebrism, creating a group known as the French Caravaggisti who, on returning to their own country, introduced the Baroque style. The most outstanding of these artists was Valentin de Boulogne (Le Valentin), of whose short life we know little, although we do know that he was in Rome in 1616. There he specialized in paintings of everyday subjects, although he also produced some religious works, including this one, which was made after a Caravaggio painting (now lost)

29939-feasting.jpg	Adriaen van Ostade's paintings are almost exclusively concerned with mid-seventeenth- century peasant life; yet rather than focussing on the labourer's unremitting struggle for existence, he borrows his approach to the subject from contemporary comedy and takes as his theme its coarse and comic side. In his later work, this gives way to a more tranquil, carefree picture of country life, expressive of the nostalgic longings of the urban middle class.While in Ostade's early work the caricatural, almost grotesque, aspect of the figures is still dominant, they increasingly develop into vivid portrayals of individual personality and natural gesture. With this comes too a change in painterly technique. The earlier spatial and figural disorder has given way to a disciplined, semi-circular placement of the figures, while the palette, earlier dominated by brown and grey, is now more various, and accent is provided by strong local colour. The atmosphere seems cooler and more transparent.In both its early depiction of the licentious and grotesque and its later evocation of the minor pleasures of modest lives, Adriaen von Ostade's work is distinguished by an outstanding capacity for observation that brings out the common humanity of his people.

14921-3ponta03.jpg	In 1888, Gauguin returned to France from Martinique. He stayed a second time at Pont-Aven, where a new and decisive meeting with ï¿½mile Bernard brought forward a new doctrine about painting. He broke away from Impressionism and applied the cloisonnism which he developed together with Bernard. The attempt at a contrived 'primitive' quality which Gauguin developed in Brittany, is particularly marked in this painting. The cloisonne effect of The Vision of the Sermon is developed, so that objects are outlined and strangely isolated against the backdrop of the tablecloth. The influence of Japanese art is particularly evident, and the composition may have been based on a print by Kuniyoshi. Added to the high viewpoint, and with the suppression of any tonal modelling, the two-dimensional surface of the picture space is exploited. In addition, the self-conscious naivety of the subject is enhanced by the grouping of objects into threes

12974-faille.jpg	Van Dyck portrayed the Jesuit Jean-Charles della Faille with, as very prominent attributes, the instruments on the table to his left. The learned divine, from a wealthy Antwerp merchant family, entered the Company of Jesus in 1613. At the highly-reputed Antwerp school he advanced his mathematical skills with two famous teachers and fellow-Jesuits, Franciscus Aguilonius and Gregorius a Sancto Vincentio, going on to teach the subject himself at Dï¿½le , Leuven and Lier, until summoned in 1629 to lecture at Philippe IV's recently founded Collegium Imperiale in Madrid. His activities in Spain were not limited to theory and teaching and from 1637 he served the court as a cosmographer and a specialist in warfare. It was commonplace in the early 17th century for a mathematician to master also related, often practical disciplines such as surveying and astronomy, and the instruments with which he is portrayed can be used in all these areas.Next to a celestial globe we recognise a Dutch circle, a quadrant and plumb line, a compass in his hand and some scientific writings. The sector is from the workshop of Antwerp instrument maker Michiel Coignet. Jean-Charles della Faille kept up a regular correspondence with his fellow-cosmographer at the Spanish court in Brussels, Michael Florentius van Langren. In his position as a military engineer, the Jesuit father travelled to regions in rebellion against the Spanish crown, among them Portugal, Naples and Catalonia, but never returned to his native Netherlands. We can thus assume that Van Dyck portrayed him shortly before his departure in 1629, probably as a commission by his family. This is also the date mentioned on the canvas, together with the age of 32. Although of a later hand, both data appear to be acceptable.This lively portrait records the inquisitive look of the Jesuit, presented in three-quarter profile. Two engravings of this painting are also preserved, a 17th century one by Adriaan Lommelin and a 19th century one by Franï¿½ois de Meersman. The latter print belonged to a series of Belgian mathematicians, which is surprising bearing in mind that in the 20th century della Faille's importance in scientific history was hardly known

33661-08misc.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 456.A dead peacock hangs upside down in space, its wings spread wide and its beak pathetically gaping. A second bird lies lifeless and heavy on a tabletop; its head protrudes over the edge, casting a slanting shadow. The blood dripping onto the floor injects a macabre visual stimulus and lends the painting a sense of immediacy. A girl is looking at the basket of fruit, its shapes modelled by light, through a window in the background: rarely has seeing been so convincingly painted. The picture of the girl represents not a portrait but a type, a character head. She is painted as a young child expressing her wonder at the world.The true subject of the spiritedly executed canvas is painting itself, its rhythmic line and its open display. The subject has its forerunners in Flemish pantry and kitchen scenes and food still-lifes by artists such as Frans Snyders, Adriaen van Utrecht, Jan Fyt and Pieter Boel; Jan Baptist Weenix would later occupy an important position in the development of the game still-life, and Chardin, too, would draw upon this tradition

13724-hercules.jpg	The scene (Hercules wrestles with Antaeus) was a popular subject in sculpture. According to Appolodorus, on his way back from the Hesperides, Hercules engaged in a wrestling match with the giant Antaeus who was invincible so long as some part of him touched the earth, from which he drew his strength. Hercules held him in the air in a vice-like grip, until he weakened and died. Hercules is depicted with his arms locked round the waist of Antaeus, his feet dangling and feature twisted in pain, levers himself with an arm against Hercules's head in a vain attempt to free himself. This typical image, well known in the Renaissance, does not appear to derive from any classical model.The painting was part of a series of seven executed for the Palazzo Cattaneo Adorno di Strada Nuova

19878-2family.jpg	Holbein dated this family portrait, which is painted on paper, in the bottom right-hand corner, but the last digit was lost when the figures were cut out round the outline later in the 16th century and subsequently stuck on a black-painted panel. Several considerations strongly suggest the portrait must date from 1528, shortly after Holbein's return from England: his son Philipp, born around 1522, is about six in the picture, and his daughter Katharina is hardly more than two; moreover, his children Jakob and Kï¿½ngold, born around 1529 and 1530 respectively, are not present.The identification of the figures with Holbein's family is based on an entry in the Amerbach inventory produced in 1587 asserting that the portrait is of Holbein's wife Elsbeth Binzenstock and his two eldest children, painted in oil on paper and mounted on wood. When Holbein returned to England, he left the picture behind in Basel. Elsbeth parted with the portrait even before her husband's death, as by 1542 at the latest it belonged to the Zurich painter Hans Asper (1499-1571). Basilius Amerbach acquired it in 1579.The moving combination of resolution and frailty seen in this family portrait is unique in Holbein's production. The introverted mood of the work extends beyond the usual level of reticence in his English portraits, where courtly finery and the dignity inherent in status to some extent shield the private lives of the sitters. The work provokes consideration of the relationship between the painter and his wife, who was separated from him for years at a time, bringing up their four children alone. The strain of this fractured family life may be seen here in the weary resignation of Elsbeth's wan face. The sober colours and emphasis on linear execution (seen in young Philip's profile) are perhaps concessions to what was acceptable in reformist Basel at the time, although elements of the dislocated triangle of the composition and the modelling of the mother's hand on the boy's shoulder are reminiscent of Leonardo's The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, which Holbein probably saw during his visit to France in 1524.The painting's dour background is a later result of cutting out the figures and laying them down on a panel; originally, there may well have been a decorative background as is the case in one copy

15934-judith.jpg	Created by Giorgione at about age 26, this painting is one of the few reliably attributed to the painter. It is marked by exceptional skill in the drawing and use of colour as well as by a youthfully playful approach to the Old Testament legend. Giorgione depicts the courageous widow, who saved her city from Assyrian invaders by decapitating their commander Holofernes, in the guise of an enchanting girl whose true weapon is not her sword but her beauty.In the 17-18th century the painting was attributed to Raphael, later to Moretto da Brescia. Originally it was probably a panel of an altarpiece.

24883-gilles.jpg	The two panels are believed to have been part of the left shutter of an altarpiece. They show the two most important parts of the legend of the holy man who had taken to a hermit's life in a forest near Arles. The one illustrates the meeting between the Visigoth king and his followers and the saint, set in a beautiful landscape. The magnificent green velvet mantle faced with scarlet and gold brocade distinguishes the king from his companions. Outstanding among this picturesque group is a man with a bow and arrows, in a green and white striped tunic. The three chief figures are placed against a background of lush flowers and shrubs and water, and the Mediterranean atmosphere evoked by the great tree in the centre gives the picture a peculiar mood of its own. Some scholars believe that a section of the town of Saint Gilles-du-Gard can be recognized in the view of a town in the background; according to the legend the church of Saint-Gilles was built by the king as reparation in honour of the saint who had been wounded

26056-15allego.jpg	This rather enigmatic painting has been studied in depth recently, enabling us to venture a more solidly based jjudgment regarding both its authenticity and the significance of the representation. It should be noted at the outset that the topmost part of the landscape has been entirely overpainted and can thus form no part of the interpretation. The rock with the virgin and the lions are, however, still in a fairly good, original condition.A young woman is shown standing in a giant piece of amethyst. She is wearing a violet-brown Burgundian dress and her hands are crossed level with her lap on a point of the crystal. This characteristically chaste pose is further emphasised by her downward gaze. Two lions, with golden shields attached to their bodies, stand threateningly on either side of a small stream that springs from the rocks and carries gemstones and coral in its current. Because of its colour, amethyst is associated with the violet, the emblem of humility and virginity. The lions are clearly intended as guards and so their shields are military rather than heraldic in function. The spring represents the Water of Life and the gemstones are a reference to Paradise. The image can thus be interpreted as an allegory of the strength of Virginity or Purity, which leads to eternal life. The city in the left distance is influenced to a large extent by the Brussels St Sebastian. This may be attributed almost certainly to the restorer

26018-09lament.jpg	Memling produced three versions of the Lamentation theme - two triptychs in Rotterdam and Bruges, known as the Kaufmann and the Reins triptych respectively, and this panel in Rome. There is nothing to suggest that this work ever had wings. Whereas the dimensions of the Lamentation in the Reins triptych are notably smaller, the central panel of the Kaufmann triptych is precisely the same size as the Rome Lamentation. Nevertheless, a different type was used in the latter. A donor is present and the Virgin embraces the body of Christ. Memling was reaching directly back here to a composition by Rogier van der Weyden, several variations of which also survive. The version known from copies in Madrid (Prado) and Berlin (Staatliche Museen) served as the model for the present work. The poses adopted by the Virgin and St John are virtually the same. The figure of Mary Magdalene has been inserted. The crosses of the two thieves in the background represent an almost literal correspondence with another work copied from Van der Weyden, namely an early-sixteenth-century copy (Strasbourg, Musï¿½e des Beaux-Arts, destroyed by fire) after a lost Deposition. It is not possible, however, to determine whether this motif appeared in the original Deposition, or came from yet another work.Attempts have been made to link the donor figure with that in the Bucharest wing and to identify it as the perfect likeness of Willem Moreel. The man in Bucharest certainly cannot be Willem Moreel, because his wife does not resemble Barbara van Vlaenderberch and only one son is present. If the donor in Rome is, indeed, the same as the one in Bucharest, then he must be younger in the Rome painting (no wife or child) - a point which does not conflict with his features

18880-saul_dav.jpg	This painting was executed along with a pendant, now in Los Angeles, that depicts Samson showing his hair - secret of his superhuman strength - to Delilah. Guercino painted the pair of canvases in 1646 for the Cardinal Falconieri, who was at the time serving as Papal Legate to Bologna. The two paintings were separated at the end of the eighteenth century.Guercino's increasing tendency towards classicism began in the 1630's when the painter fell under the influence of the late work of Guido Reni. Like its pendant, the Saul Attacking David is a splendid example of his late style, a period in which Guercino brought his investigations into classicising style to their fullest conclusion.Despite the dramatic quality of the narrative, the composition of the painting is extremely balanced: everything centres on the monumentality of the two figures, contrasting protagonists of the scene. Almost frozen in their action, they are displayed entirely in the foreground, as if in a relief sculpture. The chromatic range, light and highly refined, is rather far from the richly impasted mode of the artist's youth, as is the way in which the shadows ably underline the plastic quality of the two personages.

43399-formosa0.jpg	The triptych on panel in marble frame represents Madonna della Misericordia (Our Lady of Mercy) in the centre, the Meeting of Joachim and Anne on the left and the Birth of Mary on the right.The triptych shows the influence of Mantegna and Squarcione on the art produced by the Vivarini workshop, next in importance to Bellini's in Venice at the dawn of the Renaissance. Vivarini focused this entire work on the development of a sharp, almost sculptural line - which harmonizes well with the marble frame - enhanced by colouring that is brilliant, suggesting a not negligible influence by the work of Donatello who was at time working in Venice on his Baptist for the church of Frari

26613-03_5nw.jpg	The picture shows the Ignudo at the upper right corner of the Sacrifice of Noah (above the prophet Isaiah).The ignudi in the third bay are painted with greater fluency and the modeling is more delicate - with greater attention being paid to the reflections and the subtle effects of light and shade - than those of the first bay. Moreover, their poses are no longer wholly symmetrical. In fact, in the two figures on the left, only the lower part of the body is symmetrical, while the twisting of the bust and the head are expressions of contrapposto. The right arms of both are, however, extended toward the centre in order to hold the ribbon supporting the medallion.

15786-vanitas.jpg	Many Flemish still-lifes refer in all their beauty to the transience of life but it was Franciscus Gijsbrechts who expressed this transience in the most explicit fashion. His Vanitas is conceived as a grandiose spectacle dealing with the vanity of the intellectual world (globe, books), of the 'vita voluptaria' (musical instruments, smoking implements) and, finally, of the transience of life (skull, hourglass). The moralistic meaning of these still-lifes might have lost some of its urgency as far as modern viewers are concerned, but the visual pleasure which they offer is an equally important aspect.There are similarities between Franciscus Gijsbrecht and Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts, both in their choice of motif and in the range of objects portrayed. But while Cornelis Norbertus quite quickly specialised into trompe l'oeil still-lifes, Franciscus painted mostly Vanitas still-lifes.To a certain extant Franciscus painted the same accessories as Cornelis Norbertus, but typical of Franciscus are the costlier jugs and dishes, the table cloths with long fringes, the large musical instruments, draped cloths and finally the large bundles of crumpled landscape prints of drawings or unspecified papers, heavily dog-eared and overhanging the edge of a table or niche

22179-selfport.jpg	On the northern edge of Burgundy, but actually in Champagne, stood the medieval city of Troyes, where the Rome-trained Jacques de L'Estin worked. After painting, probably in Rome, his self-portrait, now in the Musï¿½e des Beaux-Arts in Troyes, his art continued in a much lighter vein, with plenty of light colour and swirling composition. De L'Estin is a rare example of a painter working in the provinces who kept himself up to date without degenerating into provincial naivety, and some of his pictures have been confused with the work of far greater artists.Self-portraits are rare for most French seventeenth-century artists.

03911-196madon.jpg	"The same softness of colour and the same gentleness in the group of the ""Madonna and Child"" return in the signed canvas of the Galleria Borghese in Rome, chronologically very close to the Brera painting. Yet another variation on a theme that was among the dearest to the painter, this is probably its last fully autograph version, although some critics consider it the work of the workshop. On the contrary, the expanded forms, the curvilinear widening of the volumes and the chromatic intensity are all elements that unequivocally point to the last phase of Bellini's career, as is the more relaxed connection between mother and child, where the Madonna does not hold the child closely to her in an attitude of yearning affection, but proffers it quietly to the adoration of the spectator"

00623-annuncia.jpg	Andrea painted this work for the convent of San Gallo which was subsequently destroyed in the siege of Florence (1529). The panel was then transported by the Augustinian Brothers to their new seat, San Jacopo tra i Fossi, whence in 1626 it passed into the possession of the Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena who transferred  it to the chapel then being built in Palazzo Pitti. It is an early work of Andrea done when Pontormo was in his workshop.The atmosphere is charged with ancient references quoted blithely in the theatrical background which forms a setting for the almost unrecognizable biblical story. It is usually interpreted as Susanna and the Elders - a Susanna who resembles a male nude; the Elders, three of them, lightly touched in with a few brushstrokes, are pointing to her up in an airy loggia worthy of Pontormo or Rosso.

Here the artist was dealing with a much less solemn subject, but even so the forms are rather hard.

03477-sebastia.jpg	"As a young man Bassetti trained under Felice Brusasorzi and in circa 1605 left Verona for Venice, where he befriended Palma Giovane; an artist with whom he remained in contact even after he left the lagoon. In 1616 he travelled to Rome where he worked alongside Carlo Saraceni and two fellow Veronese artists, Alessandro Turchi and Pasquale Ottino, in the Quirinal's Sala Regia (1616-17). Like Turchi and Ottino, Bassetti specialised in painting on slate, a preferred support for Veronese artists, but he also executed a number of large-scale works. Whilst in Rome he absorbed the Caravaggesque influences of his roman contemporaries but, like his Veronese companions, he maintained the muted colours more typical of painters from his native city.This painting, which is conceived in a highly contrived ""Caravaggesque"" light, probably dates from the end of Bassetti's Roman sojourn (1616-19) or from the years immediately after his return to Verona in 1620-21.

34155-hastings.jpg	The portrait was painted for Frederick, Duke of York, at whose sale it was acquired by George IV for &#163;72 9s. According to the artist's pocket-book, the work was begun in June-July 1789. It was still in progress in September when a newspaper report commented on 26 September 1789: 'Lord Rawdon's head is done - and, what is extraordinary with Sir Joshua, in two sittings. The figure, drapery, and landscape are sketched out, and in their first colour - so may be safely as well as easily finished.' A record of payment exists dated May 1790, when the portrait was exhibited at the Royal Academy. An engraving was issued in 1792. Evidence of changes made by Reynolds can be seen in the outline of the hat and the arrangement of the curtain wrapped around the tree, while the initial painting of the sky can be detected beneath the trees in the middle distance and in the far landscape.Reynolds had the keenest intelligence of any painter working in eighteenth-century Britain. His appointment as the first President of the Royal Academy in 1768 was as much a reflection of his intellectual powers as of his abilities as an artist, as indicated by the Discourses on Art addressed to the students of the Academy between 1769 and 1790. In addition, a considerable amount is known of his working practices over the years owing to the survival of many of his pocket-books, quite apart from knowledge of his personality and conversation as recorded in James Boswell's Life of Johnson (1791). Yet, with all those advantages, Reynolds failed to please George III and Queen Charlotte. Although he was granted the position of Principal Painter to the King in 1784 in succession to Allan Ramsay, it was said that 'The King and Queen could not endure the presence of him; he was poison to their sight.'This portrait of the Marquess of Hastings (1754-1826) dates from near the end of the artist's life when his eyesight (like his hearing) had begun to fail. Indeed, a note in his pocket-book of 13 July 1789 records that his eye 'began to be obscured', and it seems likely that this portrait was one of the last he painted with a sitter in front of him. Yet, Reynolds, in spite of such difficulties, created with seeming ease an heroic image. The tall figure posed against a tree is framed by the swirling smoke of battle echoed by the twisted curtain. His sword and hat are silhouetted against the background. The stance, with the right leg thrust forward and the hand raised to the chin as though in conversation, suggests a certain confidence in the face of danger. The figure is alert but dignified.The Marquess of Hastings is shown wearing the undress uniform of a Colonel and ADC to George III, the rank he held from 1782 until 1793. He was a soldier and statesman close to both the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York. His military service was undertaken in America during the War of Independence, in Brittany and the Netherlands. Appointed Master of Ordnance (1806-7), he was also made Governor of Bengal from 1813 to 1822 and Governor of Malta in 1824. He died at sea. Reynolds's portrait of George IV when Prince of Wales with a Page (now at Arundel Castle, Sussex) was presented to the Marquess of Hastings by the Prince of Wales as a mark of friendship in 1810

07837-01ladies.jpg	"Carpaccio portrays two ladies relaxing in the cool atmosphere of a garden, surrounded by a marble balustrade. The women wearing robes with immodest dï¿½colletï¿½ are sitting on a terrace where Venetian women usually bleached their hair. Their coiffure was popular in Venice at the beginning of the 16th century: curls combed on the forehead and wig on top of the head.The older lady is playing with a couple of dogs, while the other leans languidly on the marble balustrade, holding in her right hand a kerchief, perhaps a token  of ""bonus amor"". In front of her, between the parrot and the peacock that the child shows such an interest in, a pair of ladies' shoes of the kind so popular at the time; the pomegranate on the balustrade next to the right-hand dove is a symbolic reference to love and fertility, while the Torella coat-of-arms probably means that the two ladies are members of that Venetian family.The painting was extremely popular in the 19th century, also because of the title that Ruskin gave it, ""The Courtesans"""

44210-1may1851.jpg	Although Queen Victoria appointed British artists to the post of Principal Painter, the efforts of Sir David Wilkie, Sir George Hayter and James Sant were supplemented by the work of certain European painters brought to the queen's attention. Such was the case with Winterhalter, who was born in Germany, but had an extremely successful career as a fashionable portrait painter based at the leading European courts. He was essentially a peripatetic artist of a truly international status who, with the help of studio assistants, had by the end of his life amassed a considerable financial fortune. First recommended to Queen Victoria by Louise, Queen of the Belgians, Winterhalter came to England in 1842 and subsequently worked regularly for the queen and her family over the next two decades. Queen Victoria had a very high opinion of Winterhalter, admiring particularly his ability to capture a likeness and his fresh, invigorating colour. In addition, the painters dexterous brushwork and high finish were also praised, although doubts were quite rightly expressed about the accuracy of his drawing. Together with Landseer, Winterhalter provides a vivid record of Queen Victoria's court and he was responsible for many of the more important and lasting images of the queen and the Prince Consort. His achievement is in many respects comparable with Van Dyck's images of the early Stuart court.The First of May 1851 is a cryptic title for a painting that shows the aged Duke of Wellington presenting a casket to his one-year-old godson, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, who is supported by Queen Victoria. Behind these figures and forming the apex of a pyramidal composition is Prince Albert, half looking over his shoulder towards the Crystal Palace in the left background. Both the Duke of Wellington and Prince Albert are dressed in the uniform of Field Marshal and wear the Order of the Garter. In addition, Prince Albert wears the badge of the Golden Fleece. The painting derives its title from the fact that both the Duke of Wellington and Prince Arthur were born on 1 May, which was also the date of the inauguration of the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park. The Crystal Palace was the principal building in the Great Exhibition to which Prince Albert made such an important contribution. Queen Victoria recorded in her Journal that on 1 May 1851 the Duke of Wellington in fact gave a gold cup to Prince Arthur, as opposed to a casket, and received from him, as depicted here, a nosegay.The painting was commissioned by Queen Victoria, but Winterhalter clearly encountered some difficulties in devising an appropriate composition. In the queen's words, he 'did not seem to know how to carry it out' and it was Prince Albert 'with his wonderful knowledge and taste' who gave Winterhalter the idea of using a casket. As regards the composition, and to a certain extent the iconography, the painting resembles an Adoration of the Magi, and, indeed, is not unlike works of that subject by sixteenth-century Italian painters such as Paolo Veronese.Prince Arthur (1850-1942) was Queen Victoria's third son. As befitted a godson of the Duke of Wellington, he pursued an active military career, distinguishing himself during the Egyptian campaign of 1882, and was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal in 1902. Subsequently he was made Governor-General of Canada (1911) and retired from public life in 1928

00615-05trinit.jpg	"Probably in 1453, Andrea moved to the church of Santissima Annunziata, where he painted two frescoes (St Julian and the Redeemer; The Holy Trinity, St Jerome and Two Saints) that are typical of his late style. No longer interested in the heroic and monumental characteristics illustrated in the Legnaia cycle, Andrea here imbues his figures with the crude truth that he had gradually mastered over a lifetime of hard work.A deeply realistic mood dominates the figure of St Jerome in the fresco in the Corboli Chapel in the Santissima Annunziata. The saint is portrayed as a fully convinced Renaissance ascetic, possessing both humanity and mysticism. In this painting we are immediately struck by a few details that are so realistic they are almost too crude, like the old saint's body with blood gushing out of the many wounds. Above, the Holy Trinity ""with a Crucifix in foreshortening; it is so well executed that Andrea deserves great praise for it, for he painted foreshortenings in a much better and more modern manner than any artist had done before him"" (Vasari)"

33914-cabinet.jpg	"This trompe-l'oeil painting representing a cabinet of curiosities blurs the boundary between real and fictitious space.Trompe-l'oeil, the French term for ""eye-deceiver,"" is a modern word for an old phenomenon: a three-dimensional ""perception"" provoked by a flat surface, for a puzzling moment of insecurity and reflection. The early precursors of modern trompe l'oeil appeared during the Renaissance, with the discovery of mathematically correct perspective. But the fooling of the eye to the point of confusion with reality only emerged with the rise of still-life painting in the Netherlands in the 17th century. Though highly esteemed by collectors, from the beginning art theorists often dismissed trompe-l'oeil as the lowest category of art, seeing it as a mere technical tour-de-force that did not require invention or intellectual thought. In the 17th century, trompe-l'oeil masters were not only receiving praise and recognition from many quarters but also pushing the boundaries of the genre.Domenico Remps, a painter of German origin, active in Italy, was a master of this genre"

32291-19solomo.jpg	Solomon was the son of David and Bathsheba, and third king of united Israel; his wisdom was proverbial. Solomon's rein saw the construction of the Temple at Jerusalem.According to the biblical story Solomon was called upon to judge between the claims of two prostitutes who dwelt in one house, each of whom had given birth to a child at the same time. One infant had died and each woman then claimed that the other belonged to her. To determine the truth the king ordered a sword to be brought, saying, 'Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.' At this, the true mother revealed herself by renouncing her claim to the child in order that its life might be spared. The child was restored to her.The scene, widely depicted in Christian art, shows Solomon on his throne, the two suppliant women before him. An executioner stands holding the living child aloft in one hand, with a sword in the other. The dead child lies in the hand of one of the women. The subject was made to prefigure the Last Judgment, and came to be used as a symbol of Justice in a wider sense.There are many preparatory drawings to this painting in various French museums.

03310-predell7.jpg	In 1485 Domenico Ghirlandaio received the commission for the Adoration of the Magi for the main altar in the church of the Spedale degli Innocenti. The prior of the church, Tesori, also commissioned the predella with stories of the Virgin and the great cornice of the altarpiece. The latter had been executed by the carpenter Francesco Bartolo on designs by Giuliano da Sangallo, while the scenes of the predella are the work of one of Ghirlandaio's pupils, Bartolomeo di Giovanni; this is confirmed by the records and the workmanship of the fine, slender figures which are characteristic of him.The predella, with the Martyrdom of St John the Evangelist, the Annunciation, the Marriage of the Virgin, the Deposition, the Presentation in the Temple, the Baptism of Christ, the Consecration of the Church of the Innocenti, had been dismembered at the time of the restoration of the great altar (1615). In the 19th century the seven panels were in the Sala delle Adunanze. Later they were reunited with the painting, which was now devoid of Sangallo's fine cornice that was destroyed in the restoration of 1786.The picture shows one of the seven predella paintings

13075-slorenzo.jpg	"In northern Europe, Denmark was the country that showed the most individual response to naturalism. Indeed, the first half of the nineteenth century is known as the ""golden age"" of Danish painting. There developed a particularly calm form of naturalism. the tendency started with the work of Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. After studying in Copenhagen under Nicolai Abildgaard, Eckersberg worked in David's studio and then in Rome (1813-16).

31208-04flage1.jpg	"This panel painting - one of his most famous - was executed by Piero during his first visit to Urbino. It contains subtle references to the situation of the time, which are very difficult to understand today. The theory that seems to be proposed most frequently is that the painting was commissioned as an attempt to favour the reconciliation between the two Christian churches, of the East and of the West, in view of the imminent Turkish attack on Constantinople. Both the presence of the character in the centre, dressed after Greek fashion, and an inscription on the frame (""convenerunt in unum"") would seem to support this interpretation.From the point of view of composition and perspective the painting is very rigorously planned. The composition appears to be divided into two scenes, separated by the column supporting the temple in which the Flagellation of Christ is taking place. On the right are three figures, arranged in a semi-circle; their identity is not certain. They are probably well-known characters of the time and, as such, they would be portrayed with their real features. The importance of the architecture in this painting, with the elegant classical temple, would suggest that Piero was in touch with contemporary theoretical writings. The onlooker must stand directly in the centre of the painting, for the composition is strictly unitarian, and this unity is achieved by the rigorous use of a single vanishing point. The painting is an ultimate example of Quattrocento linear perspective.Even though he is working in a unitary space, Piero does not give up his interest in detail, such as the ceiling of the temple or the bronze sculpture on the column with its splendid reflection of the light. The magnificent damask garment worn by the character on the far right, with its contrast between blue and gold, reveals Piero's love for luxurious clothing and for the most fashionable styles, which many Florentine painters had eliminated entirely from their work"

The decoration extends through a vestibule, the adjoining large salon (the Salone), two symmetrically adjoining side rooms, and two loggias which at that time opened toward the south.The fresco decoration of the Salone and the loggias are attuned to each other: in the east (Loggia di Apollo), the chariot of the sun god Apollo in the ceiling fresco rides across the sky in the direction of the sunrise, while in the west (Loggia di Diana), the moon goddess Diana leads her team of horses.Above the passage from the loggias into the Salone, there are two over-door paintings. In the Loggia di Apollo, one can see at this location an argument between Apollo and Cupid. Apollo - overconfident after having killed the python with arrows - mocks the little archer. Cupid obtains his revenge and proves his superior power by enflaming the god to love with a shot from his bow.In the Loggia di Diana, the chaste Diana must protect herself against sensual longing as a lusty satyr tries to seize her. Anyone entering the Salone from the loggias is reminded by the images that even the noble Olympians were not safe from love's onslaught.The frescoes in the loggias were painted by two different artists. The Apollo and Cupid was executed by Giovan Battista Castello (called Il Bergamasco), who was also responsible for the decoration in the Salone, and Diana and Satyr by Luca Cambiaso. In the two contest scenes, the artists thus compete with each other

14243-1biccher.jpg	The tablet originating from the Biccherna (revenue office) was recently attributed to Francesco di Giorgio. It depicts the scene when Pope Pius II (Enea Silvio Piccolomini) names Cardinal his nephew Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini.This is one of the small panels that served as book covers for the semiannual ledgers of the biccherna and gabella, the financial and fiscal offices of the commune of Siena. The tradition of binding the ledger volumes with painted wood panels was instituted in 1257 and the oldest preserved panel covers the accounts of the second semester of 1258. The Archivio di Stato in Siena has a collection of over a hundred of these panels.The earliest covers usually show the camerlengo (the chief financial officer of the Republic), often a monk from the Cistercian abbey of San Galgano, as he writes in his account book, counts or disburses money, or supervises a clerk. The covers always display the coats of arms of at least four leading citizens who served as provveditori charged with overseeing the financial proceedings. The names of all these officers are prominently mentioned on the lower half of the panels, thus vouching for the accuracy of the accounts. While most of the panels of the 13th and 14th centuries are anonymous, we find among the later panels attributions to Paolo di Giovanni Fei, Giovanni di Paolo, Sano di Pietro, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and Benvenuto di Giovanni. Some 15th century panels record important events of Sienese history, such as the coronation of Pius II on a biccherna of 1460, or the Virgin protecting Siena from an earthquake on the biccherna of 1467

35326-madame_m.jpg	Complex arrangements of vegetation are often used by Rousseau as part of his pictorial language. The sequence of different leaf and flower patterns produces a rhythmical structure. In this portrait, the tall gaunt woman in a black dress with remarkably wide puff sleeves stands out directly in front of a background of flowers, above which only her head protrudes. The proportions are inconsistent, her hands almost larger than her head. Even more unrealistic is the scale of the head of this nameless woman and the little cat in the foreground on the right. On basis of these characteristics the painter succeeds in creating an impressive representation of the human figure

36758-symphony.jpg	"Schwind was a key figure in Vienna. He was a Romantic artist and music was of great importance to him as thematic reference. In 1852 he ""composed"" A Symphony in oils, and provided the commentary on it himself: ""The whole should be imagined as the Beethoven wall of a music room... and it is based on a composition by Beethoven, the Fantasia in C for Piano, Orchestra and Choir..."" Schwind said that the individual zones of his painting, into which he wove a love story, correspond to the four movements of Beethoven's composition. At the bottom we see a chamber music rehearsal (Introduction), in which one of the young listeners falls in love with the singer; later they meet in a wood (Andante); above this again we see the young man declaring his feelings at a ball (Adagio); and finally, in the little castle, the happy husband and his bride are setting off for their honeymoon in the stronghold of bliss (Rondo).Schwind's painting and his explanation of it indicate a basic phenomenon of the time - the combination of story and music to make program music. In Schwind's work we find the beginnings of the total work of art Wagner was to proclaim."

43167-genius.jpg	Vigee-Lebrun received early training from her father, a painter in pastels. Other teachers and those helpful in her career were Doyen, Vernet, Davesne and Briard. She also copied the old masters, particularly Dutch art. She soon became a celebrated portrait painter and was appointed court painter to Marie-Antoinette. She became a member of the Academy in 1783. She had to leave France in 1789 because of her court connections. From that time she travelled widely visiting Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, London, St Petersburg and Switzerland, and was inundated with academic honours and commissions. Her emotional, idealising portraits of women and children, which were often criticised for their sentimental touches, were representative of an international style of portraiture already in transition; the characteristics come out more fully in her many self-portraits

39132-01zianig.jpg	Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo decorated with frescoes the family villa at Zianigo which his father, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo had bought on his return from the task of decorating the Prince-Bishop's palace in Wï¿½rzburg and which he had restored and altered to his own needs. The frescoes were painted over a fairly long period of time: between 1759 - the date shown on one of the monochrome scenes from the chapel - and 1797 - according to a now lost inscription read at the beginning of the twentieth century in a mural scene in the Pulcinella Room. Almost all the frescoes in the small Zianigo villa were detached in 1906 and in 1936 they were moved to the Ca' Rezzonico and placed in small rooms, in a recomposition that closely repeats the original one, though with some differences and overlapping.The frescoes in the villa depict the stories of Pulcinella (also Punchinello, a classical character that originated in the Commedia dell'arte of the 17th century), scenes of villa life, games, the wars and affections of satyrs and fauns. It is a comprehensive cycle which Giovanni Domenico painted for himself in successive stages in the non-monumental rooms of the country house. When completed, the whole Zianigo work was a kind of grand recapitulation of many aspects and idiosyncrasies of Giovanni Domenico's art, while also representing the cultural passing of a period and a style. It is almost a pictorial testament which, while valuing the past, did not conceal the drama of the present nor the uncertainty of the future.In the Pulcinella Room, the absolute protagonist of the decoration is Pulcinella. The gaunt figure in the Neapolitan mask dominates the room. On the ceiling The Swing of Pulcinella is depicted. The three large wall scenes depicts Pulcinella in Love, Pulcinella and the Tumblers, and Pulcinella's Departure. Four monochrome scenes above the doors, two of them oblong in format, complete the decoration of the upper portion of the room

Its painted decoration, completed in 1704 by the elderly Luca Giordano, constituted the last phase of the decoration of the charterhouse.Giordano painted Judith in Triumph over Holofernes on the cupola vault. The figure that appears to dominate the vault is the heroic Judith triumphantly displaying the head of Holofernes to the people of Israel.

21572-orestes.jpg	The paintings Lastman made shortly after his return from Italy to Amsterdam in 1607 effectively use landscape to help set a mood. They show the profound influence of Elsheimer. Around 1610 he also began to make history pictures with the landscape subordinated to many figures, a type of painting that became his speciality. At first his crowds were scattered,and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish protagonists from secondary figures; but by the end of the decade he was able to use a crowd to enhance the dramatic action of a story.In this painting Lastman made a definite distinction between the brightly illuminated figures in the foreground, the dimly lit figures in the middle distance and the blue-grey illumination of the group in the background. Most of the light falls on the protagonists, Orestes and Pylades, standing to the left of the altar, discussing which of them will have to sacrifice himself. Here Pieter Lastman portrayed the crucial moment in a classic drama.The Greek writer Euripides (c. 4871-406 BC) described how Orestes, son of the hero Agamemnon, travelled to Tauris, together with his faithful friend Pylades, in order to steal the famous cult statue of the goddess Artemis. The priestess of the temple that housed the wooden statue was none other than Iphigenia, Orestes' sister, whom Artemis had secretly brought to Tauris years earlier. Orestes did not know that she was still alive. Before the friends could put their wicked plan into action, however, they were found out and taken prisoner. Orestes and Pylades were led along to the temple, where they were to be sacrificed - the fate of all strangers who set foot on Tauris. Iphigenia took pity on them and decided that one of them would be allowed to live, leaving it to the men to decide who should be sacrificed. Although each wanted to die to save the other, they finally decided that Orestes would be sacrificed. At the moment he was to die, however, Iphigenia recognized her brother. The sacrificial banquet was called off, and Iphigenia and the young men fled to Mycenae, taking the statue of Artemis with them.Lastman portrayed this complicated story in a skilful manner. The illumination and colour scheme were used to set off the protagonists from the dozen of supporting actors. Typical of Lastman's early work is the crowded composition, in which throngs of people can be distinguished far into the background. They form a colourful procession of spectators, winding their way from the temple to the altar, carrying armour, human heads on poles and the wooden statue of Artemis

44132-damiate.jpg	Wieringen was probably the pupil of Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom (the founder of European marine painting); he ranks as his best and closest follower. Wieringen's multicoloured paintings are more ornamental, his waves and whitecaps more schematic than Vroom's, and his skies (apart from those in his graphics) are little more than decorative backdrops.The Capture of Damiate was commissioned by Haarlem's St Hadrian Civic Guard, and it was originally mounted as an overmantel in the company's headquarters (a few years afterwards officers of the company commissioned Frans Hals to paint their group portrait). The painting represent a pseudo-historical event. According to tradition late twelfth-century crusaders en route to the Holy Land tried to capture Damiate, a port city at the mouth of the Nile which had its harbour protected by a heavy chain stretched across it from two moles. The chain was cut, according to the legend, when a ship from Haarlem ingeniously fitted with a specially designed saw-toothed prow and keel sailed across it. After this feat and a fierce battle the port fell to the crusaders.The tale exemplified the audacity and courage of early Haarlemmers, and by association, redounded to the glory of citizens of the city. By the sixteenth century the fable had acquired a mythic dimension for Haarlem's patriots. The appetite for it was satisfied by later printmakers and painters. Vroom and other artists also made drawings to stain glass windows of the subject, and Wieringen designed a huge tapestry depicting the legendary event for Haarlem's Town Hall which is still mounted there

31002-guardian.jpg	Piazzetta received early instruction from Antonio Molinari, but Giuseppe Maria Crespi in Bologna became his real teacher. To him he owed his loose manner of painting; an earthy, warm palette competing with whites, and a chiaroscuro used to create an atmosphere rather than the pathos which had been produced until recently by Johann Liss and Johann Carl Loth. When he left Crespi and returned to Venice in 1711, his art presented a complete contrast to the prevailing Venetian style as represented by Ricci, Pellegrini and Amigoni. It was not until the 1720s that Piazzetta used lighter tones. His scenes from the Old and New Testaments were painted in the genre style, and have an almost tactile closeness. Piazzetta is regarded one of the most important representatives of 18th century Venetian painting

32773-08bembo.jpg	In earlier catalogs the painting was attributed to Bernardo Luini as a portrait of Raphael. Later it was recognised as the portrait of Pietro Bembo, the poet and humanist painted by Raphael when staying at the Court of Urbino. Bembo was later to become cardinal.The portrait of Pietro Bembo, one of Raphael's earliest portraits, represents his art at the very beginning of the sixteenth century, the period of transition between his early work in the Umbrian style and that of his Florentine period. The youth in red gown and cap is seen against a landscape background depicting the gentle, hilly countryside of Umbria. The hair, hanging in long locks as was the fashion at that time, frames a gentle face; both hands rest on the parapet and in his right hand is a folded sheet of paper. Because of its general resemblance to the early self-portrait in Florence, this picture was for some time thought to be another self-portrait, while some scholars believed it to be the portrait of a young cardinal. Recent research has, however, identified it as the picture once seen by the Venetian Marcantonio Michiel in the studiolo of Pietro Bembo in Padua, representing Bembo in his youth. It was painted by the young Raphael when he met Bembo at the court of Urbino in 1506
