40307-110turne.jpg	"Turner grew from a young art student trained in executing topographical watercolours to the creator of some of the most original landscapes of his time. On his second visit to Venice, probably in September 1833, he created a series of views of the city that betray on the one hand an ardent interest in recording what he saw and, on the other, a Romantic sensibility that suffused his pictures with a sense of the grandeur of nature and of its magnificent light and colour. This picture is based in part on a pencil drawing made during Turner's first trip to Venice in August 1819 and combines two viewpoints along the Grand Canal. It was shown with four other works in May 1835 at the Royal Academy, where it was well received as one of his ""most agreeable works."""

10708-fullmoon.jpg	Dahl came from Bergen in Norway. He visited Dresden in 1818 at the end of his student days in Copenhagen as part of a lengthier tour, which ended with him taking up residence in the city on the Elbe. He became the second great master of the Romantic landscape movement in Dresden beside Caspar David Friedrich.Dahl's nocturnal panorama of the famous buildings on the Elbe captures the unique atmosphere of Dresden, the artistic and royal capital, in a most striking manner. This painting, which numbers among Dahl's most famous works, must be seen as a homage to the genius loci of the city he had adopted many years earlier.The view is seen from the same place at the right at the right bank of the river from where Bernardo Bellotto's view (also in the Gem&#228;ldegalerie) was taken.

35613-15landsc.jpg	In his last years Rubens spent the summer months in his country residence, Het Steen, at Elewijt, between Mechelen and Brussels, which he had acquired in August of 1634. There he painted the largest and most luminous landscapes of his entire career; Landscape with Rainbow and Tournament in front of Castle Steen, the latter featuring a wholly imaginary joust. They show us complementary views of a countryside pullulating with human, animal and plant life. They are odes in paint to the natural order of creation, an Arcadian vision of man living in harmony with nature. At Het Steen, Rubens enjoyed the fruits of his long and industrious career, but he also added a new facet to his reputation and ensured his historical influence as a landscape painter. We might cite, in particular, the landscapes of Constable

03609-72rebel.jpg	Beccafumi received a commission from the Carmelite friars of San Niccol&#242; al Carmine for a panel representing St Michael subduing Lucifer. The artist produced two versions the earlier of which is now in the Pinacoteca, the second is still over a side altar on the south wall of the church of San Niccol&#242; al Carmine, but without its original predella.The earlier of these two versions of the expulsion of the rebel angels from heaven by the Archangel Michael is at first sight difficult to read: the lower part of the painting is dominated by the tall, elongated figures of three standing nude men. It requires some effort to discern that, within the gloom that surrounds them, other figures are shown in convoluted poses. In the upper part of the painting, encircled by a swirling mass of flying angels, is the arresting figure of Saint Michael. Clad in fanciful antique armour, he holds his sword aloft as a sign of his victory over the vanquished rebel angels. Above him in turn appears an extraordinarily daring representation of God, portrayed in extreme foreshortening. As the deity presiding over this act of heavenly vengeance, he appears as an insubstantial - but certainly visionary - phenomenon.The second version, by comparison, is much more clearly organised. Here God appears as a monumental figure, seated in jjudgment. The bright red of his voluminous mantle and the golden hemisphere behind him ensure that this figure dominates the composition as a whole. The angelic company is organised into an orderly choir of seated figures surrounding God, with only a few of their companions engaged in expelling the rebel angels. Saint Michael has been placed much lower in the composition and acts as the principal agent between heaven and hell. Although still holding a sword above his head, he has been divested of armour and appears in a pale pink and golden yellow tunic, tied across the chest with pale blue ribbons. Beneath him, the fallen angels recline in a series of subterranean vaults lit by sulphurous light. The devil has been transformed into a snarling monstrous beast that has the appearance of a classical chimaera

20139-stillife.jpg	"In Dutch painting there is a tendency towards imitation and rhe dissolution of the boundary between real space and pictorial space. Even Rembrandt painted ""window pictures"" in which the person portrayed is standing in a door or window whose frame is identical with the frame of the painting. The generation of artists who followed him took a particularly keen interest in trompe-l'oeil techniques. Hoogstralen was a specialist in this field and the work shown here is typical of the genre. Because such trompe-I'oeil effects do not work well in depth, but are most effective on the surface, the artist chose to portray flat objects that could be placed on the picture plane to which relatively flat items could be added.Here, for example, we see a variety of everyday objects held by two leather straps over a wooden frame. That old chestnut about the spectator who is actually fooled by such painted objects is quite easy to imagine in this case, but we should not forget that such trompe-l'oeil paintings were actually intended as a joke and that they were meant to produce a sense of surprise on discovering that the objects were painted rather than real. Even so, this approach towards reproducing reality in painting does tell us something about Dutch painting in general: it is highly ""figurative"" in the sense that its content is conveyed entirely through the portrayal of objects"

07790-02redber.jpg	Although the chronology of Vittore Carpaccio's work is fairly complex and cannot easily be correlated or compared to the network of influences and trends developed by the other artists active at the time, there is a group of paintings that can undoubtedly be dated at the early 1490s since they are so close stylistically to the Stories from the Life of St Ursula. Among them, the Man with the Red Cap in the Correr Museum in Venice, which has incorrectly been attributed in the past to Lorenzo Lotto, to Filippo Mazzola and to Bartolomeo Montagna.Standing out with almost sculptural relief from the landscape background, this figure shares the proud expression of the portraits Carpaccio painted of his contemporaries even in the earliest of the St Ursula cycle canvases.This painting was earlier attributed to Filippo Mazzola or Lorenzo Lotto.

17519-1adorat1.jpg	This Adoration is thought to have been the altarpiece of the Lady Chapel of Sint-Adriaansabdij, Geraardsbergen. It was commissioned by a local nobleman, Daniel van Boechout, Lord of Boelare, who was to be buried in the chapel.The sumptuous huge panel has been elaborated in dazzlingly crisp detail, without compromising the clarity and focus of the whole. In the ruinous edifice of the Old Dispensation, the kings of the earth with their retinues, awestruck shepherds and the nine celestial orders of angels join to adore the newborn Child, seated on his mother's lap as upon a throne. Caspar has offered gold coins in a gold chalice; his name is incised on its lid lying next to his hat and golden sceptre at the hem of the Virgin's gown. Balthazar advancing on the left is identified by the inscription adorning his crown, and the artist has signed his name below. The border of the cloth on which Balthazar, like a priest at the altar, holds his precious offering, is embroidered with the first words of the hymn to the Virgin, Salve Regina: 'Hail Queen, mother of mercy, life, sweetness...' The artist's second signature is incorporated in the neck ornament of Balthazar's black follower. The third king, Melchior, waits on the right. On the hillside behind his retinue the angel is announcing Christ's birth to the shepherds. Joseph, in red and with a cane, stands at some distance gazing up to Heaven. Although generally following Netherlandish precedent, Gossart shows his awareness of modern, and even foreign, art: the dog in the right foreground is copied directly from D�rer's famous engraving of the miraculous conversion of Saint Eustace, dated to 1500/1.Two unusual features of the imagery are the dove of the Holy Spirit descending from the star, which becomes a symbol of God the Father - so that the three persons of the Trinity are represented in the Adoration - and the Virgin holding the chalice offered by Caspar. Jesus seems to proffer one of the gold coins. Of the three gifts which the Wise Men from the East presented to the Child (Matthew 2:11) the myrrh, later used to embalm Christ's body, traditionally symbolised his sacrifice; the frankincense was specified in the Old Testament as an incense reserved for the tabernacle of the Lord; the gold was tribute paid by kings to the King, after the example of Solomon. Yet perhaps an additional significance is suggested here in the Child's gesture. The royal tribute will be redeemed in blood - the eucharistic wine - through the Saviour's infinite charity.Gossart's painting provokes close reading, although its general message within the Christian story is clear. It is perhaps the last great exemplar of that painstaking art of the Netherlands which spared no labour to place at the feet of the Virgin and her Son a minute description of the costliest products of human craft - the wares of goldsmiths, weavers, furriers, embroiderers, tailors, hatters and bootmakers - arrayed on panel through ingenious mastery of the painter's brush. As a testimonial to his own craft or to show his devotion, the artist may have included his own likeness, peeping out of a narrow doorway behind the ox at the Virgin's shoulder.Gossart's main source of inspiration seems to have been the Monforte Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes. In addition, the artist also borrowed from prints by D�rer and Schongauer (e.g. the dogs from Schongauer's Adoration of the Kings, and D�rer's St Eustace).Recent technical examination of Gossart's paintings led to the suggestion that Gerard David collaborated with Gossart on some paintings including the present Adoration. It is assumed that, in addition to some other details, the head of the Virgin was painted by Gerard David, whose influence on Gossart is shown by a comparison with David's Adoration of the Kings in London

The owner, a member of Britain's Parliament, was targeted by the IRA, who broke into his estate in 1974 and took a total of nineteen paintings. It was recovered a week later, having sustained only minor damage. In 1986, the Dublin underworld stole the painting. Only after more than seven years of secret negotiations and international detective work was the painting recovered. This is the second work, together with the Guitar Player (Iveagh Bequest, Kenwood, London), given as security for a debt of fl 617 by the widow of Vermeer to the baker van Buyten, on 27 January 1676.

Foundation Beit, Blessington.""Lady Writing a Letter with Her Maid"" exemplifies Vermeer's essential theme of revealing the universal within the domain of the commonplace. By avoiding anecdote, by not relating actions to specific situations, he attained a sense of timelessness in his work. The representation of universal truths was achieved by eliminating incidental objects and through subtle manipulation of light, color and perspective.The canvas presents a deceptively simple composition. The placid scene with its muted colors suggests no activity or hint of interruption. Powerful verticals and horizontals in the composition, particularly the heavy black frame of the background painting, establish a confining backdrop that contributes to the restrained mood.The composition is activated by the strong contrast between the two figures. The firm stance of the statuesque maid acts as a counterweight to the lively mistress intent on writing her letter. The maid's gravity is emphasized by her central position in the composition. The left upright of the picture frame anchors her in place while the regular folds of her clothing sustain the effect down to the floor. In contrast, the mistress inclines dynamically on her left forearm. Her compositional placement thrusts her against the compressed space on the right side of the canvas. Strong light outlines the writing arm against the shaded wall, reflecting in angular planes from the blouse that contrast abruptly with the regimented folds of the maid's costume. The mistress is painted in precise, meticulous strokes as opposed to the broad handling of the brush used to depict the maid.The figures, although distinct individuals, are joined by perspective. Lines from the upper and lower window frames proceed across the folded arms and lighted forehead of the maid, extending to a vanishing point in the left eye of the mistress. The viewer's eye is lead first to the maid, then on to the mistress as the focal point of the painting.Vermeer shuns direct narrative content, instead furnishing hints and allusions in order to avoid an anecdotal presentation. The crumpled letter on the floor in the right foreground is a clue to the missive the mistress is composing. The red wax seal, rediscovered only recently during a 1974 cleaning, indicates the crumpled letter was received, rather than being a discarded draft of the letter now being composed. Since letters were prized in the 17th century, it must have been thrown aside in anger. This explains the vehement energy being devoted to the composition of the response. Another hint is provided in the large background painting, ""The Finding of Moses"".Contemporary interpretation of this story equated it with God's ability to conciliate opposing factions. These allusions have led critics to construe Vermeer's theme as the need to achieve reconciliation, through individual effort and with faith in God's divine plan. This spiritual reconciliation will lead to the serenity personified in the figure of the maid"

11684-humility.jpg	The impact of Masaccio's new vision had a limited impact on Siena, since for the most part, Siena maintained a distinct stylistic tradition of its own. A Sienese artist who does seem to have been affected by Masaccio, perhaps mediated by the art of Filippo Lippi, is Domenico di Bartolo. His art is exemplified by this signed and dated work of 1433, which contains passages of trompe l'oeil including the banderole with writing on it. The grouping of the figures and the roundness of the faces, particularly the one of the angel who tilts his head sharply, are reminiscent of Filippo Lippi's painting in Empoli.Like the paintings of Fra Filippo Lippi of apparently the same years, the coherent and rational light of Masaccio is not fully understood, but the massive figures and an interest in robust bodily proportions and in the nude provide a strong link to Masaccio. The motive of the Child sucking his fingers occurs in Masaccio's Pisa Altarpiece

Broad stretches in the foreground are filled with incidental characters from farming life, with a cart, country folk resting and out walking, anglers and shepherds; the walls of the fortifications have been used to hang out the laundry to dry.

23069-90madonn.jpg	Ambrogio Lorenzetti discarded Giotto's rigorous construction and incisive modeling in favour of open spaces, broadly articulated volumes, fluid composition and a colour range with many gradations. Contrary to Giotto's practice, he introduced subtle psychological effects. Note, in this painting, the intensity with which the mother and child look each other. The Virgin holds the Child with such delicacy that from a realistic point of view the support would be inadequate; the Child appears weightless. A lively detail is seen in the feet, escaping from the swaddling, which are not represented realistically but in terms of the linear cadences of the draperies.Probably intended for private devotion, this panel is an example of highly refined taste and skillful technique. On the gold ground the two large halos are indicated by a fine, incised line; the rectangularity of the panel is modified by the braided arch motif and by the flowers in the upper corners. The two figures are related to each other in a system of undulating rhythms and spiral movements. They widen or narrow with slow waverings in depth. Not a wrinkle mars the compact ivory of the faces and the Virgin's long, seemingly boneless hands

05285-1lastjud.jpg	"This vast panoramic nightmare represents the earth in her final death throes, destroyed not by water as D�rer and Leonardo were to envision it, but by the fire foretold in a thirteenth-century hymn, the sombre Dies Irae: ""Day of Wrath, that day when the world dissolves in glowing ashes"". Bosch was probably also influenced by the account of the last days given in the Revelation of St John, a book which enjoyed renewed popularity in the late fifteenth century, when it was illustrated by D�rer in his famous Apocalypse woodcuts of 1497-98. The wide valley dominating the central panel may represent the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which, on the basis of several Old Testament references (Joel 4:2,12), was traditionally thought to be the site of the Last Judgment, with the walls of the earthly Jerusalem blazing in the background.

The contribution of an assistant referred to as ""Fiduciario de Francesco"" is assumed.This highly unusual painting was the last of the artist's youthful output. The playful gestures of the two characters are emphasized by the abundant folds of the drapery. On the other hand, the perspective of the scene is expressively deformed in order to create a dramatic touch.Many elements in Francesco di Giorgio's Annunciation suggest an artist aware of his Florentine contemporaries. This Virgin is a close relative of similar figures in Verrocchio and Botticelli; the doorway behind, with its grey pietra serena surround, is Albertian. The landscape is also far removed from Sienese tradition, dotted about with Roman reminiscences and flanked by a fantastical crag such as we might find later in the work of Piero di Cosimo. Yet the impossibly slim pink columns rise as weightlessly as in any picture by Sassetta, the floor tilting steeply, the angel stepping forth ungrounded, the lectern about to slide"

42361-zierikze.jpg	In this landscape a great natural effect is achieved by the artist.There is the outline of the town, occupying almost all the horizon, in a not too distant view, and painted almost exclusively in dark tones of brown, as one might see the silhouette of a town in the failing light of dusk, with only a few patches of very dark green in the river bank. The sky is a liquid blue, with stray clouds which by their diagonal sweep define and emphasize the sky's width. The sky and the town are reflected in the calm water. In the foreground is the near bank with fishermen. Their silhouettes, and the strong red colour worn by the middle one, are points against which the vast space beyond may be measured.The surprise of this brilliant painting lies in Esaias's total matter-of-factness. All chances to embellish the picture, to make it more attractive to contemporary Late Mannerist taste, have been passed by. The painting is deliberately dry, almost to the point of fanaticism, and that is why it contains, already at this early date, the complete programme of realist landscape: the low viewpoint, the wide space, the horizon, the sky, the little figures as spatial points of reference

Angelica was loved by several knights, Christian and pagan, among them the Christian hero Orlando (Roland).

10244-2lucret3.jpg	The panel depicts the suicide of Lucretia after she was violated by Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son. Of all secular subjects he treated, Lucas Cranach painted this subject the most frequently, in almost 40 versions. At first he showed her only rarely as a pure nude, either half- or full-length, usually, as the daughter of a Roman nobleman, she appeared in a magnificent costume. However, after about twenty years, he increasingly favoured the nude version. In these works, with their black background and floor area recalling a lunar landscape, the context of the historical-mythological event loses its significance, the nude figure taking on the abstract quality of a personification of chastity.Here, as in other nudes by Cranach, the painter's main interest is not in the narrative but only in the female nude. This is emphasized by placing the body before a uniform black background

20277-saints.jpg	Huguet is an exemplary representative of Catalan painting of the 15th century, which remained indebted to medieval tradition and almost untouched by the innovations of the Early Renaissance. There are no records documenting his work before the year 1448, when he was commissioned to paint a St James altar for Arbeca. Between then and 1486, he executed a lengthy series of polyptychs, of which his Saints Abdon and Sennen Altar (1458-1460) and Three Kings altar (Barcelona, Museo de Historia de la Ciudad, 1464) stand out in particular. Huguet's painting underwent no notable stylistic development. He generally stuck to a gold background; spatial details were kept to a minimum, and the two-dimensional plane prevailed over physical volume. Huguet was so busy that he gradually employed more and more assistants in his workshop, which resulted in his works deteriorating in technical quality and becoming somewhat hackneyed in their appearance.Jaume Huguet's best-preserved work is his Saints Abdon and Sennen Altar, executed for St Peter's church in Terrassa, near Barcelona. This detail shows the main picture, featuring the standing figures of the two martyrs of late antiquity. Although today relatively unknown, in Huguet's day they were highly revered by Catalan farmers. Their story was also included in the most famous medieval collection of biographies of saints, the Golden Legend. Huguet portrays the two martyrs dressed in the style of nobles of his day. The crowns which they wear on top of their fashionable hats indicate their royal rank. In their hands they carry the instruments of their martyrdom. Tall, slender, almost boringly well-proportioned figures, with gentle faces and even features, were one of the painter's hallmarks.In a similar fashion to Cologne, Catalonia continued to employ lavish gold grounds far longer than in the Netherlands. In the present example, Huguet has even tooled a tendril pattern into parts of the gilding, while introducing raised relief into the crowns, haloes and decorative details

06013-regents.jpg	Frans Hals was the unrivalled master of the group portrait in seventeenth-century Haarlem. He was around eighty years old when he painted his last portraits of regents and regentesses of the Old Men's Almhouse in 1664. At that time new orders for group portraits went to younger artists.Jan de Bray, having a reputation as a portraitist in Haarlem, painted his first picture of this kind in 1663. His approach was different from that of Frans Hals. Whereas Hals portrayed his characters in a variety of poses, facing in different directions and with their heads at different levels, De Bray's scene is meticulously organized. The table, covered with a costly Oriental carpet, is set at a slight angle in the room. All men look directly at the observer. Although the men's heads are in slightly different positions, their black hats are all at roughly the same level. As we can just see the top of the table, we, as observers, view the scene from the vantage point of a child who has just entered the regents' chamber: the men have turned to look at us and wait for us to speak

35912-francis.jpg	"Sacchi probably undertook the rare subject of Francis marrying Poverty at the request for Cardinal Francesco Barberini, who had a special devotion to Francis, his name saint. According to legend, Francis was walking in a street in Siena, when he encountered three similar women who represented the three virtues of the Franciscan order; poverty, chastity and obedience. Francis greeted them extending a particular welcome to poverty, saying, ""you are welcome, Lady Poverty"". The saint loved poverty and truly considered that virtue to be his wife: thus the legend of the saint's marriage to Poverty was born.The format and measurements of the canvas remind us that the painting was originally meant as an altarpiece. The subject reminds one immediately of Sacchi's work at the Church of the Cappuccini, which the Barberini had decorated right at the beginning of the 1630's, and which still houses two important works by the artist.Carried out during the years of Sacchi's polemical argument with Pietro da Cortona and the baroque style painting in general, this painting shows Sacchi radicalising his ideas. The result is a very simple composition based on two monumental figures set in an open landscape."

14436-203fried.jpg	The Winter Landscape in Schwerin has its counterpart in a Winter Landscape with Church in Dortmund. The Schwerin painting is characterized by the sombreness of an expanse of snow stretching away into the infinite distance, which modern interpreters see as a symbol of death, a nihilistic sign of doom. The pendant in Dortmund introduces, for the first time in Friedrich's oeuvre, a Gothic church, seen as a monumental vision emerging out of the mist like a phantasmagoria and rising against the gloomy background of a winter sky. Nearer the viewer, a man is leaning back against a boulder and gazing up the crucifix in front of a cluster of young fir trees. He has flung his crutches demonstratively far away from him into the snow. This combination of motifs has been interpreted as a reference to the security of the Christian in his faith.In the decades before and around 1848 the world, and especially the artists of the time, looked from the north to musical Vienna, and listened to the music of the classical Viennese period. The crow on a dead branch, or the painting of the lonely wanderer between bare trees in Friedrich's Winter Landscape, was set to music by Schubert in his Winterreise.Listen to a MIDI version of The Crow, song No. 15 in Schubert's song cycle Winterreise (Winter Journey)

06752-man3sons.jpg	Bruyne was a Cologne painter, chiefly of portraits. His religious works are much influenced by Netherlandish painters of the late 15th century, and his portraits, which are grimly realistic representations of unaristocratic sitters, are very close to those of Joos van Cleve. In 1515-16 he is documented as a painter of altarpieces, and the Xanten Altar was commissioned in 1526. His career, 1515-55, invites parallels with Holbein and Lucas van Leyden, although a beautiful Nativity of 1516 (Frankfurt) is closer to Geertgen.A companion-piece representing a Lady and her Daughter is also in The Hermitage.

It provides further evidence of Correggio's skill with ancient subject matter, particularly of a sensual nature.

The imitation marble architecture as well as the arrangement of the figures engage the viewer to distinguish the real from the fictive.

34976-4malles3.jpg	Quite close to M�stair in the Venosta region of south Tyrol lies the little town of Malles with its simple little Benedictine church. In the Carolingian era, this church and the one in nearby Grab�nden belonged together, the church of Malles being affiliated to that of M�stair.A series of paintings were executed in the church around 880, but all that remains in the apses are the figure of Christ standing, of St Stephen and of Gregory the Great. On the narrow strips  of masonry between the apses there is the figure of a priest accompanied by the noble donor, who offers a model of the church to God. Roman influence has been detected in these frescoes, but their execution and treatment of detail differs significantly from the style of the figures in the M�stair church

27015-mystic_m.jpg	"In spite of the signature ""Michelinus fecit"" it was a long time till scholars unanimously accepted the fact that the panel was not the work of a Northern master but of Michelino da Besozzo, the eminent Lombard miniaturist, fresco-painter and delineator of animals. It is emphasized even today that side by side with inspirations from Venice and Verona, the work reflects the influences of the art of Burgundy and the Rhineland. This opinion is partly due to the fact that even in the period of the International Gothic such a representation lacking any spatiality was very rare in Italy.Appropriate to its theme (which is a mystic vision and not an episode that took place in reality), it is in the irrational idiom of the former that the picture evokes the marriage of the Child Jesus and St Catherine of Alexandria. The figures are improbably floating in shining, golden space. There would be no point in discussing surroundings or space, since the ground, the throne and the airy background are all of the same immaterial radiance. Nothing interprets their relationship to one another. We cannot see the back of the throne, nor the spot where it touches the ground, or whether it has a pedestal and if so what it is like. Only the decorative contours of its arms are discernible in front of the dark areas provided by the figures of St Antony Abbot and St John the Baptist. Since the milieu is undefinable we cannot state where the figures touch the ground. With one exception we cannot see their feet, indeed, even the hems of their garments seem to have a life of their own, floating in waves, instead of spreading on the ground. By this Michelino da Besozzo intensified up to the point of absurdity the homogeneity of the background, which can be seen in Stefano da Verona's picture too. However, a vision is convincing only when it contains realistic elements too. And what we can see in this picture, namely the five figures, are depicted with delicate transitions of value from light to shade, which convey the soft features and the soft body of the Child Jesus. Their complexions display a wide variety of snow-white, pale pink, golden brown and dark-brown tones.The rhythmic arrangement of shapes and colours results in an extraordinarily well balanced composition. The Virgin's head, rising in the middle, is surrounded by the semicircle of the other four heads. At the same time the dark draperies of the three figures in the back enclose the light areas of colour displayed by the body of the Child and the face and garments of St Catherine, thus presenting a fine equilibrium of colours in the composition"

23559-abraham.jpg	The subject of this painting was exceedingly popular in Rembrandt's circle and with Protestant collectors. Hagar, the Egyptian hand maiden of Sarah was the mother of Ishmael, Abraham's first son. When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ishmael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water near by, so they were both saved. Two scenes, the banishment, and the appearance of the angel are common in 17th century Italian and Dutch painting.The present canvas is the earliest of Maes's known paintings. He painted it when he was beginning to work independently after studying with Rembrandt for two or three years. In conception, the picture depend upon examples by Rembrandt, while the manner of execution is similar to that of other Rembrandt pupils in the 1650s

10549-apollo3.jpg	The great hall of festivities was designed to hold receptions, balls and musical entertainments and is quite original, also in terms of its size (14 x 24 metres): it is the largest existing room in a private Venetian residence. The real space of the room seems to be the centre of a larger imaginary area that extends beyond the false architecture painted on the walls. These trompe l'oeils, or the vanishing perspective of architectural elements used to artificially extend the real space, are generally attributed to Pietro Visconti, a perspective painter from Lombardy. The fresco in the middle of the ceiling and the fine monochromes at the centre of each wall, however, are by Giovanni Battista Crosato. The family coat of arms is shown between gilt drapery at the centre of the main wall, facing the main doorway to the room, while the double-headed eagle recurs on capitals pictured as bronzes on the false frescoed pilasters

08000-magnani2.jpg	Admiration for the great Venetian painting of Titian, Tintoretto and, above all, Paolo Veronese, which as of the late 1580s characterized all three Carracci, can be gleaned in a collective undertaking, the frieze with the Stories of the Founding of Rome adorning the hall of honour in the palazzo of Lorenzo Magnani, elected senator in 1590. While Agostino reflects the brilliant palette of Veronese on an exterior level, Annibale taps into an epic tone in which nature and history are inextricably fused, and Lodovico forces the expressive potential of storytelling, vaunting a vivid imagination in terms of both composition and colour.

He based his historical paintings on colourful, dynamic sketches and studies.This painting of ""L�szl� V and Cillei,"" painted in subdued tones and mellow scarlets, is one of the best of its kind. He presents an excellent characterization of the helpless child-king, L�szl� V (1440-1457), and his deceitful uncle, Ulrik Cillei (1406-1456) overpowers his young charge with wine, food, jesting, music and dance, and all the while the King mechanically signs the decrees and death sentences. It was a moral verdict on the leading noblemen of the time, who ruined the country for their own interests. It was therefore not surprising that Sz�kely did not win a single prize with this picture.

08931-eccehomo.jpg	In the mid-nineteenth century, awareness of the Italian past extended to the study of the old Italian masters, and especially of the fourteenth- and fifteenth-century primitives. From 1848 to 1859, this interest was apparent in the Tuscan Purist, among them Antonio Ciseri.Commissioned in 1871 by the Italian government, this is the most impressive of Ciseri's religious works and was first exhibited in the artist's studio shortly after his death. It won immediate acclaim for its luminosity and superior effect of transparent whites. With an objective, positivist approach, Ciseri describes the moment when Pontius Pilate, leaning forward from the balcony of a palace toward the crowd below him, offers up both Christ and Barabas for sentencing. The presence of Roman centurions as well as other details like ancient garments and architectural props lends this scene a sense of historical authenticity

29159-turbulen.jpg	Mulier was, with Jan Porcellis, the best of the Dutch marine painters to apply the tonal developments of landscapists such as Jan van Goyen and Salomon van Ruysdael to their chosen subject matter. Since sea, to a greater extent than land, inevitably takes on the prevailing tones of the sky, Mulier tended to use warm tones of pink or bluish-mauve to soften the predominent leaden grey of the sky. His clouds thus often threaten thunder, giving his pictures a distinctive mood. He also liked to paint small boats struggling with a brutal staccato chop thrown up by the shallow waters of the Zuider Zee or the Dutch estuaries, rather than larger vessels riding the larger rolling seas found offshore.Mulier was a member of the Guild of Haarlem, and worked under the influence of Jan Porcellis to whom the present painting was formerly attributed

36865-pentapt1.jpg	This panel belonged to a now dismembered pentaptych (five-paneled altarpiece). In its original configuration, St Benedict was the left, St Silvester Gozzolini the right and the Madonna and Child the centre panels (all in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The centre panel was flanked by panels depicting St John the Baptist (Perkins Collection, Sacro Convento di San Francesco, Assisi), and St John the Evangelist (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).When intact, the altarpiece would have resembled Duccio's polyptych in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena (the so-called polyptych 47). The pairing of Sts John the Baptist and John the Evangelist - the forerunner of Christ and the beloved disciple - to either side of the Madonna and Child is not uncommon and may relate either to the dedication of the chapel or to the name of the patron. On the other hand, the presence of Sts Benedict (c. 480&#150;543) and Silvester Gozzolini (1177&#150;1267) virtually assures that the altarpiece was painted for a monastery of the Silvestrine order, which was founded by Silvester in 1231 and followed the rule of St Benedict.The figures above the Madonna and Child are Christ flanked by Sts Paul and Peter. Segna's figures are notable for their somewhat austere, regal bearing. He also retained the Byzantine web of gold striations on draperies to enhance their status as sacred icons

18408-1908grec.jpg	In the background, a view of Toledo, as Troy, and the Trojan Horse. El Greco would have known the sculptured group in Rome, uncovered at the beginning of the sixteenth century, but more significantly he would have known the original story, which he has interpreted in an entirely independent way. This is the only known painting of classical subject matter by El Greco, and he does seem to give it a special spiritual meaning. The horizontal format is uncharacteristic of his works in Spain, which become increasingly more elevated in composition and spirit. The essential verticality of the composition is made clear, however, by the high horizon and the upward movement of the flanking figures. The view of Toledo appears to have been taken from the same view-point as that of the Metropolitan Museum painting, which it continues to the right, the two together completing the panorama of the town. The panoramic View and Plan of Toledo in the Museo de El Greco, Toledo, is taken from a different viewpoint.Recent cleaning has uncovered a third figure in the group on the right, which El Greco had overpainted

18420-2101grec.jpg	This version of the subject dates from the last years of El Greco's career. It is assumed that the painting was partly executed by Jorge Manuel. However, it bears El Greco's signature and its quality is very high.The painting is very close to the version in the National Gallery in London. The most remarkable changes relate to the architectural setting. El Greco shifted the action from the Temple porch to the inner sanctuary. At the centre of the structure supporting the altarpiece is a tomb-like object with an obelisk. On the left there is a relief of the Expulsion of Adam and Eve, and above it a statue of a naked male figure who has been variously identified as Adam, his son Seth or an unidentified idol.The changes introduced into this version indicate El Greco's continuing reflection of the subject.

The large altarpiece of the Baptist illustrates the painters style in the 1360s. The somewhat archaic composition is based on the example of the Master of St Cecilia Altarpiece: the large central figure is surrounded by small scenes. In the centre St John the Baptist in the Act of Crushing Herod at his Feet is depicted, the Descent in Limbo is the main element of the predella.

42242-0310vela.jpg	"Spain's greatest painter was also one of the supreme artists of all time. A master of technique, highly individual in style, Diego Vel�zquez may have had a greater influence on European art than any other painter. Vel�zquez lived in Madrid as court painter. His paintings include landscapes, mythological and religious subjects, and scenes from common life, called genre pictures. Most of them, however, are portraits of court notables that rank with the portraits painted by Titian and Anthony Van Dyck. Duties of Vel�zquez' royal offices also occupied his time. He was eventually made marshal of the royal household, and as such he was responsible for the royal quarters and for planning ceremonies. Vel�zquez was called the ""noblest and most commanding man among the artists of his country."" He was a master realist, and no painter has surpassed him in the ability to seize essential features and fix them on canvas with a few broad, sure strokes. ""His men and women seem to breathe,"" it has been said; ""his horses are full of action and his dogs of life."" As court painter to Philip IV, Vel�zquez spent a large part of his life recording, in his cool, detached way, the objective appearance of this rigidly conventional royal household, with little interpretation but with the keenest eye for selecting what was important for pictoral expression and with a control of paint to secure exactly the desired effect. In painting these royal portraits, whatever interpretation he made or whatever emotional reaction he experienced he kept to himself. Royalty, courtliness of the most rigid character was his task to portray, not individual personality"

33457-20oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 523.The painting illustrates the Old Testament story told in Genesis XXXIX. Note how Rembrandt, following the principles of Baroque painting, has used light to emphasize the salient features as if on a stage at the climax of a drama. Potiphar's wife, the central figure in the tragedy, seems to speak eloquently and nervously as she gestures towards Joseph's scarlet cloak at the foot of the bed. Joseph, standing in the shadow at the left, denies the accusation, while Potiphar, his hand resting uneasily on the shoulder of the aging beauty, clearly shops his indecision and conflict of emotion.This painting was probably executed with the contribution of Rembrandt's workshop.

22538-2assump1.jpg	The frescoes in the Carafa Chapel of the Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome give full measure to Filippino Lippi's gifts as well as to an elaboration of his style. This work announces the onset of Filipino's middle period, which is even more imaginative, bizarre, and anecdotal than his early phase.The frescoes, finished in 1493, display the artist's new visual experiences, including an awareness of Melozzo da Forli's art. Analogous daring foreshortenings are found in Lippi's Assumption for the massive altar wall of the chapel. Filippino's music-making angels are skillfully incorporated into the curve of the wall, and their joyful celebration is appropriate to the occasion. There is no single point of sight for these images; some are seen sharply from below, others are nearly perpendicular to the surface plane. As a result, an implication of celestial movement into space is first established and then denied. The angels have sweeping, agitated draperies that indicate movement, but emphasis is placed on the edges of forms so that they appear flat and linear rather than three-dimensional. Although the limbs of the figures are monumentalised to some extent, the total impression remains decidedly lyric. Mary, standing on a cloud bank, is heavily draped, and the presumed weight-free left leg emerges beneath the swells of the garment, in a shift from the normal gravitational logic

15316-ruhout.jpg	Two Flemish court painters of Bruges descent who earned their reputation abroad, Frans Pourbus the Younger (1569-1622) and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1562-1636), were active at the close of the sixteenth century and especially in the first quarter of the seventeenth. They are linear descendants of famous Bruges painter families. Their solid, old-fashioned technique and the rigid, immovable expression of their figures seem more like an extension of the sixteenth century than a herald of the seventeenth.Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger left Bruges when he was seven, accompanying his father, the renowned Bruges painter and etcher who emigrated to England in 1568 because of his Protestant convictions. There the young Gheeraerts became a court painter. His art shows the schematic and rather insipid character of English official portraiture in the early part of the seventeenth century, even though he managed to refine it to a high degree. The Portrait of Lady Anne Rushout, a late and very attractive work from 1631 - unsigned but very close to Gheeraerts' manner - shows how Gheeraerts used refined arrangements of posture, light and cloth textures to shape his fragile figures. Anne Rushout, the widow of John Rushout, was born into a noble family that was later endowed with the lordship of Northwick

42988-3love3.jpg	In the 1570s, Veronese did not confine his attention to religious subjects. He was also intensively active in the field of profane painting, often with an erotic content. The series of the so-called Allegories of Love in the National Gallery in London belongs to the latter group. The four painting, which were probably originally intended to decorate the ceiling of a single room, were in the eighteenth century entitled Infidelity, Disillusionment, Respect, and Happy Union. However, since then the paintings have been given differing interpretations. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that they represent the sorrows and pleasures of love in contrasting pairs - joy and disenchantment, faithfulness and unfaithfulness

The vivacity is chiefly due to the illusionistic effect of the man leaning out of a niche, which recedes slightly on the left. His right hand appears to be projecting out of the picture, and the viewer's eyes are automatically drawn to the attribute he is displaying. The gold ring, together with the touchstone which he is holding in his left hand, are the clues to his profession and official function.

09784-concert.jpg	Costa was a native of the northern Italian city-state of Ferrara, and much influenced by Cosimo Tura. By 1483 he had settled in Bologna, working for the ruling Bentivoglio family. After the death of Mantegna in 1506, Costa succeeded him as court painter in mantua, where he died.Although this painting is dated to Costa's Bolognese period, it may more accurately reflect performances at the court of Ferrara, where music was especially appreciated and secular music evolved earlier than in other Italian centres. It is unlikely, however, to be a portrait commissioned by the sitters. Most probably it was one of a series decorating a room: whether other pictures would have represented more musicians with different instruments, or the 'sister arts' of poetry, dance and so on, we do not know.Costa captures faithfully the effect of making music in concert. The singer-lutenist in the centre leads, his eyes on the music book on the ledge before him. The others join him in polyphonic song - we can tell they are sounding different notes by the different shapes formed by their open mouths - beating time to keep together. The man on the right looks at the leader carefully, the woman on the left places her arm on his shoulder the better to follow. At some stage during the performance these two musicians might accompany the lead singer on the fiddle and recorder in the foreground.While the Concert is rare for the period in having no religious or symbolic connotations, it is by no means the only instance of a late fifteenth-century artist seeking to suggest polyphonic sound - see for example the angels singing in Piero della Francesca's Nativity. Costa was later to adopt a softer painting manner, but this work, like his bust-length portraits, tries to emulate the meticulous realism of Netherlandish painting

18308-1107grec.jpg	The two paintings in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome (Adoration of the Shepherds, Baptism of Christ) were considered workshop pieces or autograph replicas of two of the three pictures that El Greco executed for the Colegio di Do&#241;a Mar�a de Arag�n in Madrid (now dispersed and housed in the Muzeul de Arta, Bucharest and the Museo del Prado, Madrid). However, a recent radiographic analysis (1997) has proven that they are original oil sketches by the hand of El Greco himself. The presence of pentimenti, compositional emendations beneath the paint surface, reveals the creative process of the artist and leads to the conclusion that these are not copies but preparatory bozzetti for the Madrid cycle. The important commission, probably designed as a triptych to decorate the high altar of the chapel, was given to El Greco in 1596: work continued until the Holy Year of 1600. The third oil sketch, depicting the Annunciation, is preserved at the museum in Bilbao.The silvery light, the coloristic range based on cold tones, the quick, almost impressionistic brushwork and the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow in this picture are all typical characteristics of El Greco's Spanish manner (1576-1614)

15022-marque05.jpg	"In August 1901, Gauguin settled in the Marquesas Islands, in the remote village of Atuona, Hiva Oa, where he built his ""House of Pleasure,"" decorated with his wood carvings and paintings. The lack of money and ill-health were made worse by a permanent conflict with the authorities, from the police to the bishop. In the midst of these worries that gradually weakened him, he painted his last masterpieces, And the Gold of Their Bodies, Barbarian Tales.Gauguin perceived that which civilised man calls contemptuously ""barbarian"" and ""savage"" as morally wholesome, as containing a primordial purity, a healthier and more normal state of human condition. Consequently, he escaped always further, first to Brittany, and then to Martinique, Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands. Before Pablo Picasso and Andr� Derain discovered African art, Gauguin found his inspiration in primitive arts.In his late paintings, produced on Hiva Oa, Gauguin seems to have attempted a reconciliation between his Western past, and the more ""savage"" Polynesia. Nowhere is this more evident than in Contes Barbares. The West is represented here by the figure of the painter Meyer de Haan (1852-1895), a friend of Gauguin, who accompanied him to Brittany but due to health reasons could not follow him to the South Pacific, whom Gauguin had not seen since they had worked together in Brittany. The liberty that Gauguin has taken with this portrait, and the suggestion of a demonic aspect to Meyer de Haan's character, implies a West that is necessarily corrupt. The Orient, on the other hand, is represented by two stoical Polynesian figures, the red-haired figure of Tohotaua, who was portrayed in Woman with a Fan, and the dark-haired woman who sits in a classic Buddhist pose, perhaps a quotation from Borobudur.The meaning of the title is not clear. In his last works, Gauguin had abandoned his earlier practice of naming his paintings, but he made an exception here. The steady gaze of all three figures suggests that any communication is conducted with the spectator rather than within the picture space itself"

32964-05sibyl.jpg	In the Renaissance period, the decoration of a chapel was the most common task in the field of religious painting. Countless examples survive in a wide variety of forms. The decoration of a chapel was fundamentally dependent on its architectonic structure. The more elaborate the architectonic articulation, the more the fresco decoration becomes a subordinated filling of the interstices. Where chapels consisted only of altars in front of the walls of the church, their paintings also served as decorative elements in the church's main room. The decoration of Agostino Chigi's altar niche in Santa Maria della Pace in Rome can also be seen as decoration for the nave.Chigi ordered frescoes of prophets and sibyls on the walls above the arch of the niche from Raphael. The depiction of prophets and sibyls in the spandrels of a chapel arch was, in itself, nothing new in Rome. What was new was the way the full height of the church wall was employed to create a two-storey prospect of figures that transformed the architecture into an iconostasis. Seated sibyls are grouped below, their forms harmonizing with the supporting arch of the chapel; above it, the vertical thrust of the windows mirrors the standing prophets. The illusionistic pier structure provides them with space

07609-63sleepi.jpg	When Caravaggio received his honorary knighthood, his presence on Malta was likened to that of Apelles on the island of Cos. This curiously sombre little picture is the only classical relic of Caravaggio's time on Malta, to which an old inscription on the back of the canvas ascribes it. As the painting was in Florence by 1618, Caravaggio may have taken it with him when he fled.The plump, solid figure is well articulated by the artist who had learnt in Rome all that he needed to know about human anatomy from antiquity and the Renaissance; and yet he is affectionately observed as though he were a mere mortal child asleep. In the darkness it is possible to make out his wings - he is not a young putto - and the quiver of arrows on which he sleeps, the bow with its broken string and the arrow, with a tinge of red, that he holds in his hand. In human affairs he plays a symbolic role.Here Cupid is not in charge of fate. While forgetful Love sleeps on, lovers cannot cope with the clamorous demands of their passions, and they are lost. But even if Love has been vanquished in the past - his bowstring is broken - he has ammunition, the quiver and the arrows, with which he can fight again.

Although the number of surviving pictures shows that this was an extremely successful product, Cranach carried out the many versions with great care. The version in Munich is of such high quality that it may have been painted largely by Cranach himself.The bunch of grapes has numerous symbolic meanings, relating both to the Virgin and to Jesus. To interpreters of the Scriptures the Virgin is seen as the noble vine on which the divine grapes of Christ were nurtured. At the same time, by analogy with the grapes crushed in the winepress, it refers to Christ's forthcoming sacrificial death, as well as to the image of Christ as the true vine and his believers as the branches (John 15, 1-17)

20276-last_sup.jpg	This Last Supper is a late work by Jaume Huguet whose art is highly characteristic of the period. In these late works the master heightened the effect of splendour by using embossed metal plates. Almost four centuries had passed since the painter of Seo de Urgell produced his altar panel. Now we have a representation of Christ not on his throne but at table with his disciples: Christ is still the central figure in the composition but this is no longer emphasized by the halo or a difference in size; the means are now purely pictorial - a cloak darker in hue than those of the disciples, the eyes looking straight at the spectator, and the movement of the disciples as they lean towards him. Huguet certainly did not achieve the unity seen in Leonardo's great work, but this painting does show that he was striving to group his figures effectively. Renaissance paintings revealing a knowledge of perspective had not yet reached Huguet's workshop, but he already shows a Renaissance enjoyment of the small things of life: the bread and the glass of wine on the table are not merely symbolic, they constitute a still-life. There is a similar enjoyment in his representations of the cat, the bird, the apple on the table and the mosaic pattern of the floor

12548-4young_m.jpg	This painting probably came from the collection of Rudolph II. D�rer returned to Nuremberg in the spring of 1507, after his second sojourn in Venice. Opinions differ as to the whereabouts of the painting of this portrait, which demonstrates, on the one hand, all the pictorial characteristics of the Venetian tradition (following in the steps of Giovanni Bellini, or Vicenzo Catena), and shows the depiction of a youth wearing a typically Venetian beret, which would mean it was Venice; on the other hand, the type of wood used for the panel, lindenwood, would have its execution in Nuremberg, upon his return. It should be recalled that D�rer only used panels of poplar while in Venice, or, rarely, elm. The alternative, regarding the setting and brightness of the portrait being typically Venetian, in fact, is purely speculative.The portrait almost aggressively approaches the spectator. It is dominated by a light, slightly reddish face, an intense, far-off gaze, a short and robust nose, a wide mouth, and turgid lips surmounted by a hint of downy hair. Even the beard under the chin is delicate and contrasts with the almost frizzy hair, painted with an extremely thin brush. Despite the fact that the painting is not completely preserved in this area, one can still appreciate the extraordinary skill of execution. One appreciates above all the difference between the stroke used for the hair and the one, just as skillful though different, adopted for the hairs of the fur collar, giving a showy trim to the coat. His talent drew praise from the Venetians and particular admiration from Giovanni Bellini. The snow-white of the shirt represents the third note of colour of the painting, next to the delicate pink of the flesh and to the black, found in the elegantly worn beret and in the clothing, silhouetted against the similarly black background.He employs what he learned from Venetian painting and his special talent for painting, with very fine strokes for hair and fur - a talent that markedly distinguishes him from his Venetian colleagues. D�rer thus manages to vivify even a face like this one, that except for the mouth, has rigid and immobile features, and for that, on the whole, is not very expressive.On the reverse side, without a preparatory drawing and with light brush strokes, an ugly old woman is painted, who winks rather obscenely. She reveals her nude breast and holds a bag of coins. With the original frame lost, it is unfortunately impossible to know if this small painting was to be part of a diptych, as some have put forward

32797-32prato.jpg	The Madonna of the Meadow is the first of a series of full-length figure compositions that portray the apocryphal encounter between the Child Jesus and the boy Baptist. The boy Baptist is supposed to have recognized and worshipped Christ as the Redeemer even in their childhood. Raphael makes this clear by letting Christ take the cross from John.Michelangelo's influence on Raphael is evident in this composition. The pyramidal structure of the figure group recalls Leonardo (whose cartoon for the St Anne was shown in 1506 in the Church of Santissima Annunziata). But Raphael exerts his own balancing capacity on the Leonardesque volumetric conception, infusing it with the idyllic serenity which characterizes his paintings from this period. The work as a whole is structurally harmonic, from the figure group (dominated by the affectionate figure of the Virgin Mary who supports the Child and glances tenderly at the young St John) to the sweeping landscape (made luminous by the mirror-like lake which stretches from one side of the panel to the other). The twisting figures of the two children clearly reflect Michelangelo's figurative research

12008-johnbart.jpg	"Dossi executed this painting for the chapel of Pontichino delle Sale, in the Cathedral of Ferrara. The panel once bore a date (1527) and a dedicatory inscription, now vanished but recorded by Baruffaldi (1697-1730) as reading ""A Christi Nativitate anno MDXXVII Kal Mensis Martii"". At the feet of Saint Bartholemew a monogram signature is still visible: reading ""S.B.D."", it was once regarded as a sign of the participation of Dosso Dossi's brother Giovanni Battista. The painting was brought to Rome in 1597 and later entered the collection of Cardinal Flavio Chigi. Its presence at the Chigi Palace in the Piazza Santi Apostoli is recorded in that family's inventories.The identification of the figure in the left margin of the composition as Duke Ercole I d'Este of Ferrara is confirmed by the close similarity of his facial features to those of a portrait of Ercole I now in the Gallery of Modena. In the Modena portrait, the Duke is shown wearing a plaquette of St John: his association with the same saint is repeated in by their juxtaposition in the Palazzo Barberini picture. The other figure to the left, shown in profile, has been identified as the donor, Pontichino delle Sale, a fact recorded by Baruffaldi.

19462-stil_fru.jpg	On the edge of a niche, half covered by a bronze-coloured velvet cloth with a fringed edge, a large number of objects are presented in a highly studied fashion in such a way as to maximise the volume, colour and texture of each individual item and to produce sensuous contrasts: a luxuriant still-life that is a feast for the eyes. The base of the composition is formed by a Wanli egg-shell china bowl with fruits. We can make out an orange, a half peeled lemon, apricots, white and purple grapes, medlars and plums. To the right a lobster, flanked by peaches and apricots on a raw wood box. To the left a simple round box serves as a base for a half filled rummer. The presence of an elegant fluted glass, providing the top of the composition, is indicated solely by the light reflected on the narrow top. A third, bowl-shaped glass stands - scarcely visible - between the fluted glass and the lobster. A small collection of flowers - roses, a carnation, violets - forms a colourful point of light and a visual counterweight to the dominating red lobster to the left of the bowl. The visual gaps are filled and a lighter accent is added with smaller fruit, creepers, twigs, blades and insects: we see blackberries, medlars, hazelnuts, acorns, cherries, a bumble bee, caterpillars, butterflies and a dragonfly.In the composition a number of ovals are enclosed in a triangle, which in turn is literally rounded off by the arch of the niche. A large diagonal traverses the whole ensemble, ending on the lower left on the lid of the reed basket. To the right of it, vine tendrils curl over the edge of a copper wine cooler.For more than a hundred years this work of art was catalogued as being by Jan Davidsz. de Heem. Despite the undoubted quality of the piece, sealed with the master's name on the top left corner, a detailed stylistic investigation and a closer analysis of the signature by De Heem expert Fred G. Meijer have cast justified doubt on the true author. Recently a canvas from the Joseph Verner Reed collection was designated by him as the prototype for this and other, already known variants. Who painted this version remains for the time being an intriguing question: we do not immediately know any figure in De Heem's immediate and wider circle to whom to attribute this painting exploit.

30842-saints2.jpg	This painting was part of a series of eight panels painted for an altar complex in the church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. The altarpiece had the form of a Roman triumphal arch, with large scenes flanked by Perugino's standing saints, which are notable for the subdued colouring and subtle treatment of light. The commission for the altarpiece was originally given to Filippino Lippi, and then was passed to Perugino, who finished the work in November of 1507. The altar was definitively dismantled and dispersed in 1654.All of the painted panels survive, though those of individual standing saints have been cropped to varying degrees at the top and bottom. The Deposition (probably from the front side of the altarpiece) is in the Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence; an Assumption of the Virgin (probably from the reverse side) is in a side chapel of the SS. Annunziata, Florence; a pair of panels, St Margaret of Antioch and the Blessed Francis of Siena are in the Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg; and two more saints, cut down to half-length, Catherine of Alexandria and Filippo Benizzi are in a private collection and the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome, respectively; another pair, St John the Baptist and St Lucy are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.There are several hypothetical reconstructions of the altarpiece which almost certainly consisted of only these eight paintings

05245-01christ.jpg	In this painting St Christopher appears in a landscape charged with evil. His red cloak bunched up behind him, the giant Christopher staggers across the river, with the Christ Child on his back. According to legend, Christopher had served a king and the Devil himself in a search for a powerful and worthy master, a search which ended only when a hermit converted him to Christianity. The hermit stands at the edge of the water at lower right, but his treehouse has been transformed into a broken jug which houses a devilish tavern; above, a naked figure scrambles up a branch towards a beehive, a symbol of drunkenness. Across the river, a dragon emerges from a ruin, frightening a swimmer, while a town blazes in the shadowy distance. These and other sinister details recall the landscape on the exterior of the Haywain triptych, but unlike the Haywain pilgrim, Christopher is well protected by the passenger he bears

24021-3chapel.jpg	Mantegna's first important commission from Ludovico Gonzaga was the decoration of the chapel in Castello di San Giorgio, executed in the first half of the 1460s. It is unfortunately impossible to reconstruct the whole of Mantegna's original intentions there with any confidence, although some panels almost certainly traceable to the chapel still survive. They include three paintings in the Uffizi: The Ascension of Christ, The Circumcision and The Adoration of the Magi. Today they are mounted as a triptych in the Uffizi with The Adoration of the Magi in the centre. They were given this format in 1827, but the inconsistencies in both composition and iconography indicate that these are individual works rather than parts of a uniformly planned altarpiece. Nevertheless, they were created for the same chapel.The subject of this painting is the circumcision of Christ eight days after birth, therefore on New Year's Day. Since the late Middle Ages, New Year's Day had often been connected with images of the presentation at the temple 40 days later, as prescribed by the law of Moses (Luke 2:21-38). Joseph is carrying a sacrifice of two doves in a basket. The setting is richly decorated. In the lunettes, two related scenes from the Old Testament are depicted: left, Abraham's sacrifice; right, Moses's presentation of the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written

30685-vase1.jpg	This painting and its pendant in the same private collection show a gilt metal, large-handled ewer of flowers resting on a roughly hewn and worn stone support against a grey background. A variety of large flowers are loosely arranged in the vases with a natural looking, informal air and an asymmetrical compositional relationship between the large and small blooms. The bouquets seem to overwhelm their containers and a sense of the fullness of the arrangements is conveyed by the depiction of the flowers occupying the planes farthest away from the viewer in less detail and in darker tones than those in the foreground. A number of climbing flowers tease the space around the flower pieces and particularly charming touches include the jasmine that trails over the ledge in one of the pictures and the convolvulus that seems to head towards the droplets of water on the ledge in the other. The conspicuous dew drops on the flowers and leaves in one of the paintings is an obvious means of persuading the viewer of the freshness of the blooms, although this device was relatively little used by Spanish flower painters.

43826-poedua.jpg	Captain Cook's three voyages (1768-79), and the expedition of the Frenchman Comte de La P�rouse (1785-88) attracted huge international attention. They were accompanied by artists and scientists and the voyages documented in illustrated publications.The artist chosen to join Cook's third Pacific voyage (1776-79), the Swiss John Webber was hired as an illustrator, to prepare plates for the account Cook intended to publish when he returned. His many detailed drawings focus mainly on the life and habits of the local peoples. Webber's illustrations turned out as Cook would have wished, but Webber wanted to make exhibition pictures from his experiences, and Cook would have been less pleased with some of these. Poedua, the chief's daughter from the Society Islands whose portrait appeared in the Academy in 1785, had in fact been one of Cook's hostages, and Webber painted her while she was locked in his quarters. But, for his London audience, she stands in a lush Tahitian setting, bare-breasted, mysteriously smiling, a Pacific Mona Lisa

32461-tributem.jpg	"Preti's biographer Dominici reports that this painting The Tribute Money was executed in Malta, where the painter had travelled in 1660 as a Knight of Malta in order to work on the decoration of the cathedral of San Giovanni. The painting is of particular interest in view of Preti's encounter with the works of Caravaggio who had executed some important paintings in Malta after 1607. The theme treated here is the biblical tale culminating in Christ's fateful words: ""Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."" (St Matthew, 22:21)In the dark brown tones of the painting, we can barely make out the six figures half illuminated by a light from some indiscernible source. The tax collector pauses in his writing as Peter hands him the coin. Only this pause indicates the miracle that has just occurred: Peter found the coin in a fish he had caught at the command of Christ (St Matthew 17:24). The turban of a man, a hand holding a pen, another holding a coin, a face in profile with a deeply lined forehead, turned towards another face of which we can recognize only the temple and the nose, a bald head, a little red fabric and the heavy folds of a rough brown cloth are the scattered but not unconnected fragments from which our gaze wanders to and fro, reconstructing the narrative"

13761-davic.jpg	Fetti made repeated use of the subject of David. Two other versions of the subject are to be found in Dresden and in the Viezzoli Collection in Genoa.An innovator &#151; together with Liss and Strozzi &#151; of early seventeenth-century Venetian painting, Fetti was clearly influenced by Caravaggio in this work. He arrived in Venice in 1621 and died there two years later. In this short time he painted the series of fine Parables, in which he managed to fuse Caravaggio's world and the Veneto universe; in these paintings the light, moving unfettered and increasingly restlessly, loosens up Caravaggio's powerful chromatic substance to the point of ultimately dissolving and eroding it to the utmost.Here again it is light that takes over, light instinct with touches of Lombard and Roman feeling, and fleshy, soft Rubensian brushwork that moves freely in setting this youth in the colour-scheme as more than a figure of myth &#151; with the attributes of a man of his time &#151; rather than of the victor of Goliath the giant. Thus, with inventive freedom and freshness of vision, Fetti envelops any subject, profane or religious, with the warmth of human sympathy.

26030-13john2.jpg	The central panel focuses upon a Sacra Conversazione, a gathering of saints around the Virgin. Mary is enthroned on a golden seat and is being crowned Queen of Heaven by two dark-blue angels who hover above her. St Catherine kneels on one side, recognisable by the instruments of her martyrdom, the sword and wheel, and from the wedding ritual. The attribute of St Barbara, kneeling on the other side, is represented as a white stone sacrament tower. The Eucharistic Host is visible through the traceried window in a glass cylinder mounted on a crescent moon. Although the Host was another attribute of this saint, it may also be interpreted here as an allusion to the Holy Mass - symbolism which is continued throughout the remainder of the scene.The standing figures of the two St Johns on either side of the Virgin in the middle ground personify aspects of the Eucharist. St John the Baptist with the lamb at his side points with his right hand to the incarnated Jesus, the true sacrificial Lamb, who holds an apple in his hand to indicate that he is the new Adam. St John the Evangelist blesses his poisoned chalice in the manner of the priest during Mass. The sacral nature of the scene heightens the significance of the book held up to the Virgin by the angel kneeling like an acolyte on the right, and the music played by the angel with the portative organ on the left. Mary functions as a kind of divine, consecratory altar. The overall scene is thus a vision of the Eucharist. The composition of the group is perfectly symmetrical, as is the architectural construction to the rear that encloses them. It is a kind of apse, with an ambulatory, without walls or windows.Memling was doubtlessly influenced by the architecture in Jan van Eyck's Virgin with Canon van der Paele, which he opened up and elongated to form a series of light columns, thus taking the setting a stage further. Six brownish-red, round marble columns stand in a semi-circle on a tile floor. They are surrounded by a second crescent of dark-grey composite piers, whose bases are linked by the straight edges of the floor, which thus forms a polygonal footing for the architecture. A simplified version of this construction is to be found in Memling's Granada Virgin. The floor-pattern is repeated several times in his work. Allowing for the aberrations arising from manual execution, the perspective is systematic and geometrically correct. The narrow vertical openings between the columns reveal a continuous landscape with ruins and buildings in which small episodes from the lives of the two male saints are enacted. The two wings each depict one such incident in enlarged form in the foreground. In addition to these realistic portrayals, the carved groups on the two capitals above each saint also depict key moments from their lives. The scenes connected with the altarpiece's principal figures are not, however, the only action going on in the landscape. There is a third background scene which, though interwoven spatially with the others, actually relates to the donors, namely the clerics of St John's Hospital in Bruges. It depicts the measuring of imported wine at the city crane by a monk from the hospital (behind St John the Baptist), and another monk on the far right, half obscured by a column. This striking and detailed little figure was once taken erroneously for a self-portrait of the artist. However, close examination reveals his features to be those of Jacob de Ceuninc. St John's Church, which no longer exists, can be made out next to the column to the right of the wooden crane, from where it could be seen. It forms yet another allusion to the St John theme

26340-sickchil.jpg	Gabriel Metsu was born in Leiden, the son of a Flemish painter who had emigrated to the north. He was a pupil of Gerrit Dou, a painter of genre scenes and the founder of the so-called 'fijnschilder' school of painting, whose work is characterized by its very high finish. Metsu was one of the founder members of the Leiden guild in 1648 but by 1657 was living in Amsterdam. Like so many artists from smaller towns (including Rembrandt, who also came from Leiden) he was drawn to the metropolis by its thriving art market and the hope of lucrative commissions. Metsu is a fascinating and eclectic artist whose work at different times shows the influences of Jan Steen, Nicolaes Kn�pfer, Gerard ter Borch, and his master Gerrit Dou.Most of Metsu's paintings are genre scenes but he also painted religious subjects (including a notable Noli Me Tangere of 1667, now in Vienna) as well as a few portraits, still lifes and game pieces. This particular painting is a genre scene and yet the pose of the child on her mother's knee is reminiscent of that used to depict the Infant Christ in Mary's lap. These religious resonances are deepened by the small black-framed painting of the Crucifixion which hangs on the wall above the figures. Metsu's technique is quite different from that of his master: the mother and child are broadly painted with a rich, almost succulent application of paint. His palette too is bolder and more varied than Dou's. In all, there is a similarity with contemporary Flemish painting and even echoes of pictures of the Virgin and Child by Anthony van Dyck

26105-27column.jpg	Christ stands before the whipping-post, his hands crossed in front of him and tied with a cord that also passes around his waist. It is not clear whether this also binds him to the post. A rod made of twigs and a scourge with a broken handle lie on the tiled floor on both the left and right, where they have been left behind symmetrically and in a cross shape by his tormentors. Another rod has been thrown carelessly to the ground to his immediate left and rear, while to the right we see another broken scourge. Memling also inserted part of the latter's handle in the left foreground on top of the already painted floor. There are thus three examples of each instrument, which means that the flagellation presented here belongs to the type with three torturers, as in the scene in the Greverade triptych in L�beck. Christ's mauve tunic has been thrown to the ground behind him. The background is kept dark. It is evident from the relief of this dark colour that a wide, moulded stone arch was originally painted here, located behind the pillar as a kind of rear porch of the dark torture-chamber. It is not clear whether this architectural motif has darkened so much that it can no longer be seen, or whether it was actually overpainted with the present dark ground by Memling himself. The form is comparable with that of the arch which surrounds the Man of Sorrows in Esztergom. The entire surface of Christ's body is covered with droplets of blood that well up from pointed wounds. He is wearing the Crown of Thorns.Although the image might appear familiar, this representation is rare, if not unique. Christ is, indeed, depicted as a kind of Ecce Homo, but he is shown at the point before he is dressed in the imitation king's cloak, the cane is placed in his chained hands and he is exposed to the mockery of the mob. He is shown naked apart from a loin-cloth, after the Flagellation but nevertheless with the Crown of Thorns on his head. He is thus presented in a kind of compassionate conflation of the Flagellation and Ecce Homo themes: a Man of Sorrows with the arma Christi portrayed shortly before the Crucifixion. The slight asymmetry of the column, which stands a little to the left of centre, and of Christ's feet, which are located somewhat to the right of the centre line, creates a visual balance between the figure and the architecture on a floor pattern that is nonetheless perfectly symmetrical. Memling applied a similar procedure on several occasions.The painting was not discovered until late (exhibition Bruges 1958). It is an autonomous devotional work which has survived all but intact in its original frame. Its attribution to Memling cannot be doubted. The slim, elongated figure is comparable stylistically with later works such as the Stuttgart Bathsheba, the Basel St Jerome and the Greverade triptych. The somewhat rigid modelling and the simplified, direct brushwork also point in that direction

11113-early04.jpg	Beside portraiture, Degas's early work was also centred on historical themes drawn from religious tradition or mythology. Between 1860 and 1865 he painted five historical paintings, for which there are several sketches and versions: Young Spartans Exercising, Semiramis Founding a City, Alexander and Bucephalus, Jephthah's Daughter, and The Sufferings of the City of New Orleans.These paintings are very original and unlike any historical painting in the nineteenth century. They conformed to the rules of classicist composition, but they were also  innovative because of the freshness of his figures and the warm colours of his landscapes.Degas made his Salon debut in 1865 with The Sufferings of the City of New Orleans. To the artist's disappointment, it was given scant attention. It must have seemed anachronistic and artificial; a medieval landscape setting was being used to symbolize the sufferings of the American city of New Orleans, which was occupied by Union troops in 1862 in the course of the Civil War

19978-4lady.jpg	The first portrait miniatures were produced in France, their precursors being the small circular works commissioned by Francis I to celebrate the victory of Marignano in 1515. Jean Clouet was among the early practitioners of this format, which seems to have arrived in England by 1526 in the form of French royal portraits. Ten years elapsed before Holbein's contribution, but his work marks an immediate advance over the productions of earlier native practitioners like Lucas Horenbout. The small scale and different medium - vellum mounted on playing card (and termed `miniature' because of the lead, Latin minium, used in the paint) did nothing to hamper Holbein's sturdy realism.The identity of the lady is uncertain - the Romantic view of the 1840s judged it to be a portrait of Henry VIII's tragic fifth wife, Catherine Howard, executed for alleged adultery, although no ascertainable portrait of her exists elsewhere. What is certain is that Holbein's powers of characterization lost nothing in the confined space. Features of his late style include the clarity and simplicity of the background, often eschewing even the standard biographical information so as to maintain as direct a perception of the sitter as possible

42562-09milkm.jpg	"Signature: Not signed.Provenance: This picture ranges among the most highly appreciated paintings by Vermeer, since shortly after his demise and also in subsequent years, second only to his View of Delft. It also fetched the second highest price in the Amsterdam sale of 1696, no. 2: ""A maid pouring out milk, extremely well done, by ditto, fl 175."" The price is reasonable, given the mediocre level at which his paintings traded. The work never left Holland, and its attribution to Vermeer was upheld throughout. Slankert enumerates various Amsterdam sales in which the Milkmaid is mentioned and highly spoken of, until the canvas became part of the Six collection, Amsterdam, in the earlier part of the nineteenth century. It was acquired by the museum in 1907-8 from this source.Although the genre of ""kitchen pieces"" belongs to a long tradition in the Netherlands, with Joachim Beuckelaer and Pieter Aertsen in the sixteenth century being its initiators, it lost favour in the subsequent century, with the exception of Delft, where it endured. Vermeer's realization, however, has nothing in common with his archaic forerunners. His vision is concentrated on a single sturdy figure, which he executes in a robust technique, in keeping with the image that he wants to project. The palette features a subdued colour scheme: white, yellow, and blue. But the colours are far from frank or strident, and are rather toned down, in keeping with the worn work clothes of his model.The still life in the foreground conveys domestic simplicity, and the light falling in from the left illuminates a bare white kitchen wall, against which the silhouette of the maid stands out. One gains from this deceptively simple scene an impression of inner strength, exclusive concentration on the task at hand, and complete absorption in it. The extensive use of pointill� in the still life lets us presume the use of the inverted telescope in an effort to set off this part of the painting against the main figure and alert the viewer to the contrast between the active humanity of the maid and her inanimate environment"

32231-06massa2.jpg	Poussin painted two versions of The Massacre of the Innocents between 1628 and 1632. For the second version, he made a preparatory study in a drawing that he evidently only translated into a painting some time later.In the second version, he extracts a single motif - the man trampling on the child and grasping the mother by her hair - from the first version and composes a new scene around this group. Its essential elements are already present in the drawing: from a number of figures lined up in a row, Poussin reduces the protagonists to the ensemble of mother, infant and soldier and supplements this with a mother fleeing in the right-hand background. The figures are made to stand out in monumental fashion against the blue sky.In 1927 the British painter Francis Bacon, who at that time was living near Chantilly, saw in the local Mus�e Cond� the Massacre of the Innocents II, from which he would draw inspiration throughout his career

31141-7find01.jpg	The story continues in the middle register of the left (east) wall.This is one of Piero's most complex and monumental compositions. The artist depicts on the left the discovery of the three crosses in a ploughed field, outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem, while on the right, taking place in a street in the city, is the Recognition of the True Cross. His great genius which enables him to draw inspiration from the simple world of the countryside, from the sophisticated courtly atmosphere, as well as from the urban structure of cities like Florence or Arezzo, reaches in this fresco the height of its visual variety.The scene on the left is portrayed as a scene of work in the fields, and his interpretation of man's labours as act of epic heroism is further emphasized by the figures' solemn gestures, immobilized in their ritual toil.At the end of the hills, bathed in a soft afternoon light, Piero has depicted the city of Jerusalem. It is in fact one of the most unforgettable views of Arezzo, enclosed by its walls, and embellished by its varied coloured buildings, from stone grey to brick red. This sense of colour, which enabled Piero to convey the different textures of materials, with his use of different tonalities intended to distinguish between seasons and times of day, reaches its height in these frescoes in Arezzo, confirming the break away from contemporary Florentine painting.To the right, below the temple to Minerva, whose fa�ade in marble of various colours is so similar to buildings designed by Alberti, Empress Helena and her retinue stand around the stretcher where the dead youth lies; suddenly, touched by the Holy Wood, he is resurrected. The sloping Cross, the foreshortened bust of the youth with his barely visible profile, the semi-circle created by the Helena's ladies-in-waiting, and even the shadows projecting on the ground - every single element is carefully studied in order to build a depth of space which, never before in the history of painting, had been rendered with such strict three-dimensionality

12571-5cleric.jpg	The painting was considered in Nuremberg (1778) to be of Johann Dorsch, an Augustinian friar who had converted quite early on to Lutheranism. This identification, however, was challenged by various critics, since Dorsch became the parish priest of Saint John's in Nuremberg in 1528. Some have hypothesized that it was a portrait by Huldrych Zwingli, the great Swiss reformer; but only side profile portraits of him exist, which do not give rise to a fair comparison or to a reliable attribution. Most critics would opt for the former identification, also because, according to more recent studies, the meeting between Zwingli and D�rer could not have occurred before 1519, on the occasion of a mission in Zurich in which he participated with his friend Pirckheimer and Martin Tucher.As in the portrait of Wolgemut (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg), D�rer succeeds in effectively expressing the vigorous personality of the subject, modeling the head with a slight rotation leftward, toward the light, and framing it with a severe black attire against a green background. The fine brush strokes, especially for the hair and eyelashes, are well preserved

19850-2passio.jpg	Religious paintings form a significant part of the work Holbein produced in Basel. From modest, private commissions in the period 1519-20 (for example, the Man of Sorrows), through the Dead Christ of 1521, his interpretation grew increasingly painterly, culminating in the broad sweep of emotion and design seen in the Passion. The coherence of the work is underlined by the decorative framework and is the result of Holbein's continued study of Italian masters. Holbein's maturity is evident in the way such derivations - the lighting from Raphael's Vatican frescoes, the armour from Mantegna-esque sources - are combined with a natural, native power of religious expression, dramatic and full of particularized incident, which produces a result quite different from the lofty idealism of the Italian Renaissance. This change can be charted by comparing the Entombment here with Raphael's 1507 version. The use of limewood panels, the tendency to depict contemporary dress (as worn by some of the mercenaries haranguing Christ) and the supernaturalistic nocturnal lighting, show the northern tendency predominant.The eight scenes depicting the Passion are spread over four tall, slender panels, each of which is divided in half horizontally. In the top row (left to right) are Christ on the Mount of Olives, the Arrest in the Garden, Christ before Caiaphas, and the Scourging. The bottom row (left to right) shows the Crown of Thorns, the Via Crucis, the Crucifixion, and the Entombment

19408-stillif3.jpg	Heda's monochrome banketje still-lifes from the first half of the 1630s form a remarkably cohesive group. He drew from a strictly limited repertoire of objects, which recur in close relationship to one another in many if not most of his pictures from this period. The relationship between them is modulated, but not substantially altered. The roemer containing white wine and the overturned tazza, seen in the present picture, are usually shown, as here, with the roemer behind the foot of the overturned tazza, although they are shown at either side of the composition or in its centre. This motif is found in several works from 1630, and then consistently until 1634, when Heda completely ceased to use it, except for a few substantially later works in which he seems deliberately to have revisited his early period. The staggered arrangement of partly eaten pies on pewter dishes is also found in many of his pictures from this early period, starting with the picture dated 1631 in Dresden

26072-20young.jpg	The portrait of this young man is a textbook example of the genre as developed by Memling. He is shown in three-quarter pose, to just beneath his shoulders. Pictured before a park-like landscape, his right hand resting on the edge of the painting in the left corner, his gaze is fixed on the horizon. The modelling of his features is evened out by the diffuse frontal lighting. His costume is sober and dark: the coat appears to be black but might actually be darkened purple-brown. The black collar that sticks out at the top is part of his waistcoat. The hairstyle would appear Italian, although no concrete evidence can be provided to support this.Originally purchased as an Antonello da Messina, the painting has been definitively ascribed to Memling since 1896.

20710-s_august.jpg	"Federico da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino, was both a distinguished condottiere and a cultivated humanist. In 1473, he decided to build an enormous new palace, for which he had commissioned a design from the Dalmatian architect Luciano da Laurana. Artists came from all over Italy - sculptors from Venice, specialists in marquetry from Florence - to work on the decoration. One room at the top of the building was intended to serve as his ""studiolo"" - a quiet retreat, remote from the bustle of the court, where the Duke would be able to read, write and meditate. Since he could not find a painter anywhere in Italy who knew how to work in oils, he sent for a Flemish artist to decorate this private space. This artist would seem to have been Joos van Wassenhove (Justus of Ghent).What we do know for certain is that after Justus had painted the Communion of the Apostles for the Brotherhood of Corpus Domini, he went on to play a key part in the making of twenty-eight portraits of famous men for the studiolo. These pictures depict great philosophers, famous poets and doctors of both the Greek and Roman Churches. Today they are divided between the Galleria Nazionale delle Marche in Urbino and the Louvre in Paris. Justus was also long believed to have been the painter of the Portrait of Duke Federico and His Son and of The Duke and His Son Listening To a Lecture, which are at Hampton Court, but it is now agreed that these two paintings are clearly not his work.Justus's style during the years he spent in Ghent was probably very close to that of Rogier Van der Weyden in his use of figures based on popular types. Skeletal bodies, forced stationary poses, and a light and subtle palette ranging from wine-red to hyacinth blue and acid green are all characteristic of his art at that period. When he moved to Urbino, he abandoned neither his earlier manner nor the Flemish concern for realism, but adapted them to these monumental works, incorporating influences from both Italian art and the humanist ideas that circulated at the Duke's court.The portraits he executed for the ducal palace, although works of some historical importance, do not really bear comparison with the perfection in this genre of his great Italian contemporaries. Justus appears to have had assistance in his work on these paintings from certain Tuscan painters and even from Spanish artists who were residing in Urbino at the time. Some authorities have gone so far as to describe him as a mere assistant himself, attributing the true paternity of these works to Melozzo da Forli or Giovanni Santi, artists whose names are now largely forgotten, or to the Spaniard Pedro Berruguete, who - as we know played an important role in decorating Federico's hideaway. However, the fourteen paintings in the Louvre have recently been examined using laboratory techniques, which have established that they are all drawn in a way that is typically Flemish and that two of them, the portraits of St Jerome and St Augustine, are entirely by Justus's hand"

08473-judith.jpg	Cavaliere d'Arpino's (Giulio Cesari's) Judith with the Head of Holofernes symbolically alludes to the violent decapitation of the Assyrian general without showing the gruesome moment that both Caravaggio and Artemisia Gentileschi chose to depict. Instead a beautiful, almost demure, Judith raises Holofernes' head by his locks as her maidservant Abra looks on in puzzled reverence. Cavaliere d'Arpino's Judith is the embodiment of female virtue and moral perfection, an ideal heroine who has redeemed her people. Yet, at the same time, she seems capable of exercising her seductive powers directly upon the viewer, as if the beholder were Holofernes. She is in possession of two dangerous weapons, her sword and her sexual allure.In 1602-03 Cavaliere d'Arpino had frescoed a series of Old Testament heroines in the Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati. There he depicted Judith as a full-length figure striding across the plain in front of the enemy encampment while Abra follows behind stuffing Holofernes' head into a sack. Topologically the figures are very similar, but in the easel painting Cavaliere d'Arpino condensed the composition so that the picture essentially becomes an idealised 'portrait' of Judith. In this sense it is very close to his Diana (Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome), in which the huntress is also reduced to a half-length idealised figure. In both these 'portraits' there is an emphasis on the decorative effects of colour and design. The brilliant reds, blues and whites of Judith's costume serve as a foil for the carefully delineated jewels and golden sword hilt. Baglione emphasised that Cavaliere d'Arpino was capable of working in two different styles, one of which was far more superficial than the other. It is likely that the more superficial pictures, such as Judith and Diana, were destined for the open art market and not painted on commission.

14475-406fried.jpg	While the majority of German artists lived in Rome, particularly in the early nineteenth century, or undertook extended visits to Italy, a few still managed to resist the pull of the South. One of these was Caspar David Friedrich, who studied in northern Germany and Denmark, and then, apart from a few trips within Germany and Bohemia, chose to settle in Dresden and never left it. Friedrich dedicated himself almost exclusively to painting landscapes, but his main objective was not the depiction of natural phenomena. The exact observation of nature was merely the basis for his symbolic content, which used the medium of landscape to contemplate the human condition and man's relationship with nature and with God. Friedrich's small painting, Oak in the snow, is based on accurate observation, and yet the image of the gnarled oak tree also has symbolic significance.The oak is a symbol of the pre-Christian world. The fallen branches denote the meaningless of heathen existence, while signs of spring in the melting snow and the blue sky herald new life in Christ

03912-205criso.jpg	"In 1513 Bellini signed and dated the altarpiece with Saints Christopher, Jerome and Louis of Toulouse of the church of San Giovanni Crisostomo in Venice. (It is usually referred to as the Altarpiece of San Giovanni Crisostomo.)The painting had been commissioned in 1494 by the merchant Giorgio Diletti, who had left instructions in his will for the construction of an altar and the execution of an altarpiece to go with it representing Saints Jerome, Louis and Crisostomo. The almost twenty years that elapsed between the ordering and execution of the altarpiece, and the partial modification of the identity of the saints requested by Diletti, have raised a number of queries which scholars have only partly resolved. The first uncertainty concerns the bishop saint on the right holding a book bearing the inscription ""De civitate Dei"", which has led some scholars to identify him with St Augustine. However, the inscription on the book is almost certainly a later addition: its extraneousness is revealed by the fact that it is written on the back of the volume and by the uncertainty of the inscription itself, unimaginable in Bellini who was always highly accurate and extremely precise. Besides, the Anjou lilies on the bishop's cloak confirm that it must be the French noble Louis, who renounced the throne to become a Franciscan. According to a complex iconological interpretation of the altarpiece, St Louis in his lavish bishop's robes represents a pastoral and liturgical significance. In this he provides a contrast with Christopher, an emblem of the active faith and preaching, and both are placed under an arch, a symbolic image of the church, on which the second verse of Psalm 14 is written in Greek: ""The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God"". The choice of the Greek language is explained, besides the fact that the church of San Giovanni Crisostomo was the centre of the Greco-Venetian community, also by remembering Bellini's contacts with the erudite circle that revolved around Aldo Manuzio. Manuzio, indeed, is credited with an important edition in Greek of the Psalter, which was printed between 1496 and 1498.Beyond the parapet St Jerome, a hermit and doctor of the Church, represents the highest point of spiritual life, that of mystical exaltation and revealed science. Beside him the fig-tree symbolizes that he has been chosen by the Lord to understand its supreme law.According to this interpretation we are therefore confronted by a clear, conscious stand-point in the contemporary religious debate that existed in Venice during those years: a position by which action and contemplation are a unitary moment in the ecclesiastical path.Undoubtedly such a complex and culturally significant proposition must have been established by the client in the first place; nonetheless, Bellini's humanistic and theological lucidity too is certainly confirmed once again"

26656-01_7si1.jpg	Unwinding a scroll with her left hand, the Delphic Sibyl seems to be turning toward the viewer. The effect of movement is accentuated by the swirls of the light blue mantle lined with yellow fabric with red shadows and the pattern of the folds of the light green tunic. The very refined colours are characterized by delicate tonal passages and enamel-like surfaces.The unique female figures and representations of the eternal mother are overwhelming. Of course, the Sibyls differ vastly from the Prophets, for Michelangelo remained mindful of the saying 'mulier taceat in ecclesia'. With the exception of the Pythia of Delphi, they are not conceived as priestesses. It is that which is beautiful and most characteristic, in short, their essentially feminine quality, that is brought out. As a group, including not only the three beautiful young women but the others too, they represent the Renaissance ideal of the virago, in the original sense of the word; a woman physically and mentally heroic. One must imagine these Sibyls free of male bondage, chiefly because their male aspect, existing side by side with the female - for they are not masculine women - is very much in evidence in the form of strength and power. This, admittedly, applies least of all to the Pythia of Delpbi who shines with a priestly and inspired radiance, which does not prevent this pagan servant of Apollo from being a young and enchanting girl.The Delphic virgin is coifed with a white priestly band beneath a peacock blue headdress draped like a crown or diadem; she gives true oracles and lives on in the great Holy Virgins of Christian art, who often wear a sibylline expression. The left arm bent over the open scroll is prefigured in the 'Madonna Doni', the fair hair is blown back by the wind of the spirit

00800-predel1.jpg	The large altarpiece, called Perugia Triptych and executed for the Cappella di San Niccol&#242; of the church San Domenico at Perugia, contained three main panels, a predella with three pictures, and two decorated side pilasters. It was dismembered in later centeries. The majority of the parts are in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria at Perugia, while two of the predella paintings are in the Vatican.The central part of the triptych represents the Madonna with the Child and Angels, while on the side parts four saints are shown. The predella depicts the story of St Nicholas.The first predella painting (this picture) shows the birth of St Nicholas (on the left), The Vocation of St Nicholas (in the center) and the Giving Dowry to Three Poor Girls (on the right).This scene refers to the most popular legend concerning this fourth-century churchman. He reputedly tossed bags of gold through the open window of a house, providing the three women who lived within with dowries and thus saving them from turning to prostitution.

29274-207muril.jpg	She is not shown in the thralls of mystical rapture, nor in those of devotion. Murillo's Mary is a very young woman with an almost childlike face, who is kneeling at her prie-dieu, her eyes cast pensively downwards. She has set aside her basket of handiwork and seems to have been disturbed by an angel in the midst of her prayers. Were it not for the presence of his wings, even the angel would seem to be a very worldly creature. He is not floating in some uncertain sphere, nor is he a vision, but is kneeling on the floor tiles. Strong-limbed and barefoot, almost like a peasant, his pretty face is framed by dark locks. With one hand, he points towards the dove of the Holy Spirit, which floats above their heads in a truly unearthly and intangible celestial vision. With the other hand, he makes a gesture of persuasion: he seems to be explaining the purpose of his mission quite vigorously to Mary.Although the event seems plausible in a distinctly earthly manner - even the putti in the clouds do not alter this impression - the miracle is clear. Mary's innocence, underlined by the lily as a symbol of purity, is of such intensity that the spectator senses her quiet reservation, the excited anticipation of the prophesied miracle and her astonishment at the experience

36649-elisabet.jpg	This masterly altarpiece from a parish church near Budapest, was only recently identified as a painting of Kremser Schmidt. In the art topography of the county, published in 1958, it was presented as a work by an unknown master from the second half of the 18th century. It escaped attention that it is quoted in the list compiled in 1787 by Koloman Fellner, a pupil of Kremser Schmidt, about the works of his master. On the other hand Rupert Feuchtm�ller, the author of a recent, extraordinarly thorough and rich monography on Kremser Schmidt, while citing the village's name from the list - Wereseth�z, Veresegyh�z in Ungarn - mentions the St. Elizabeth altarpiece amongst the painter's lost works. However, its authenticity and the identity of its master is beyond doubt, and we can now also indicate with certainty the person who commissioned it.The parish church of this village in the V�c,  diocese was rebuilt in 1777-78 by Krist�f Migazzi Bishop of V�c who also arranged for the furnishing of the church. Bishop Migazzi, Archbishop of Vienna, for a long time was in contact with Kremser Schmidt, who was rather preferred in church circles. Migazzi commissioned Kremser Schmidt with the high and side altarpieces of V�c Cathedral in 1770-71 and 1774 (covering with the high altarpiece a fresco of Maulbertsch, painted only a few years before), and he also employed him with his Viennese artistic enterprises. The Veresegyh�z commission was probably given to Kremser Schmidt around 1778, the year of the consecration of the church. The theme of the painting was a legend of the church's patron saint, St. Elizabeth of Hungary. It shows the popular moment when the royal princess, in spite of her family's disapproval, distributes alms to the poor

14848-alpheus.jpg	The subject is taken from Ovid, Metamorphoses (5:572-641.) Arethusa was bathing on a river when she met Alpheus. She felt something stirring in the depths beneath her so she hurriedly get out of the water. She fled away from the stream but was chased by Alpheus. Worn out, Arethusa called on the her goddess, Artemis. Artemis turned her into a spring of water. But still, she was not free from Alpheus, changing back into a river, he went into the tunnel that Arethusa went into and now his water is intermingled with the water from Arethusa's fountain. It is said that if you throw something into the Alpheus in Greece, it will turn up into Arethusa's well in Sicily.In the present composition we see Diana reaching down to envelop Arethusa in a cloud, just as the nymph's strength is beginning to fail her, and transform her into a stream which runs underground

17819-803goya.jpg	The group of blacksmiths is based on a brown wash drawing of Three Men Digging (Metropolitan Museum, New York), which belonged to an album dated 1819 by Carderera. Goya has adapted the figures in such a way that the painting, like the drawing, gives the impression of a study from life. The subject is of a kind that he frequently recorded in drawings; there are many similar documentary scenes of men and women of the people in the 1819 series. As a subject The Forge is distantly related to The Injured Mason and similar in character to the small Water-carrier and Knife-grinder (Szepmuveszeti Museum, Budapest), which were in the artist's possession in 1812. However it is unique in Goya's oeuvre as a large-scale close-up view of men at work. The late sketchy style emphasizes the brutish appearance of all three figures and the attitudes of the blacksmiths, suggestive of enormous strength.The Forge was undoubtedly an uncommissioned painting, which passed into the possession of Goya's son. It was later in the collection of King Louis Philippe and was sold at Christie's in 1853 for L10

14128-denoncid.jpg	Dominique-Vivant Denon (1747-1825) was a French painter, printmaker, illustrator and author. A diplomat under the ancien r�gime, he served Napoleon as supervisor of the scholars sent with his Egyptian campaign, and afterwards as director of the Mus�e Napoleon (Louvre). As organizer of the Salon exhibitions under the empire he had great powers of patronage and largely dictated the programmes of the pictures of the Napoleonic campaigns painted by Gros and others. His taste was eclectic and he also encouraged young artists, such as Alexandre-Evariste Fragonard.Denon had a passion for collecting relics of the great - bones of Abelard, a tooth of Voltaire, whiskers from Henri IV's moustache - and Fragonard depicts him replacing in its tomb, after an evidently minute examination, the skull of the semi-legendary eleventh-century Spanish hero El Cid. In a subtly edited form, this referred to events during the French siege of the Spanish city of Burgos in 1808, when a regiment of dragoons, hoping to find gold and jewels, destroyed El Cid's monument in San Pedro de Cardena near the city. The French governor of Castille, appalled at this sacrilege, salvaged what he could of the remains and built a new monument in Burgos, but not before he had presented Denon with a parcel of the great man's bones. Far from replacing them where they belonged, Denon kept them for the rest of his life

30591-2paintin.jpg	Very early in his career, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, considerably influenced by Luca Giordano, absorbed the examples of Magnasco and Sebastiano Ricci and turned his style towards a refined decorative freedom in airily elegant works of pure rococo taste; and through his stays in several European artistic centres London, D�sseldorf, The Hague, Antwerp, Paris, Prague Dresden and Vienna, his work gained a certain popularity. The 'Allegory of Sculpture' and the 'Allegory of Painting' belong to his last years. They are an interweaving of the lightest of figural rhythms, a coloured web of impalpable, rarified weightlessness, shot through with silvery transparencies which recall the pastels of the artist's sister-in-law, Rosalba Carriera. Like hers, the paintings of Pellegrini are emblematic of the skin-deep spiritual frivolity of a part of the eighteenth century

28912-adoratio.jpg	Moretto was born in Albino, in the foothills of the Alps. The neighbouring towns of Brescia - home of his teacher Moretto - and Bergamo, where Moroni worked from 1554, were situated in a frontier region between Milan and Venice, Central Italy and Southern Germany. We first encounter Moroni in 1546 in Trent, painting altarpieces during the initial session of the Council convoked there to heal and reform the Church. When the Council of Trent closed in 1563, it had, however, formalised the rift between Catholics and Protestants. Moretto, deeply responsive to the injunctions of the Council, followed its prescriptions of doctrinal Catholic orthodoxy, clarity and realism in religious art. Throughout his life Moroni modelled his religious paintings on those of Moretto. But his real talent lay elsewhere, and it is as a portrait specialist that we prize him today

19367-2hayez.jpg	Hayez is a representative of the many other artists who brought the transition in Italian painting to the second half of the 19th century. He was the most celebrated during his lifetime, and his long career enabled him to play a formative role in Italian painting almost the entire second half of the 19th century. His early work still shows the influence of Ingres in its delicate painting and severity of line, but he soon adopted the Romantic approach.The huge format of this painting has two effects: firstly, the fate of the people who were driven out of their native town in 1818, when the British handed it over to the Turks, is raised to monumental proportions, serving as a warning, and secondly, the large scale draws viewers into the scene, making them, so to speak, witnesses of the event

35066-greer.jpg	In the portraits of the late 1700s, when English Neoclassicism and its cult of naturalness flourished, a landscape usually appears behind the sitter. The neutral background of this portrait, created by an artist well-known in his time, does not make it extraordinary: the sketch-like painting manner (unusual for European art of the period), a colour scheme based on subtle transitions of grey-brown tones, and the subject's attire suggest that she is posing outdoors, exposed to a damp London wind

42122-06vecchi.jpg	Giorgio Vasari and assistants decorated the ceiling of the Sala di Lorenzo il Magnifico. In the centre the scene of Lorenzo Receives Gifts from the Ambassadors of Various Nations is depicted, while other episodes from the life of Lorenzo the Magnificent are around.The decoration of large halls with the deeds of the nobility and their ancestors was intended to inspire the viewer's admiration. The depiction of such events from the recent past has a long tradition. Most such cycles in the first half of the sixteenth century, however, are dedicated to a single person or event. By contrast, from the middle of the century onward this genre was increasingly devoted to the representation of dynasties. The first steps in this direction were taken by a family that did not belonged to the old aristocracy, but knew enough to exploit skillfully the memory of its ancestors for propaganda purposes - namely the Medici in Florence during the years of that city's transition from a republic to a principate. Duke Cosimo I openly exploited the depiction of the history of the older Medici in the Palazzo Vecchio to justify his own position. This decoration occupied Vasari and his workshop from 1556 to 1571, with interruptions, and its final version comprised more than a hundred individual depictions of historical themes

05549-06medici.jpg	This is perhaps the most authentic portrait of Giuliano, assuming that it was painted in the lifetime of Giuliano. However, the death symbols (the dove sitting on the dead branch and the half-open door) on the picture seem to contradict this assumption.The portrait of Giuliano de' Medici (1453-1478), the younger brother of Lorenzo the Magnificent, is turned to the right and there are no less than three known version of it. Giuliano had been killed on 26 April 1478, while mass was being celebrated in Florence Cathedral, during the course of an attack made by the Pazzi family, who were the Medicis' rivals for power and banking business.Botticelli placed this portrait in a most skilful relationship with the framing forms. In the background, one window shutter is open, allowing us to see the blue sky, and the other is behind the subjects bowed head. The dove by the window jamb is a symbol of loyalty, and for this reason it is thought that Giuliano commissioned this portrait following the death of his courtly love, Simonetta

After her husband's death she saw her position at the Danish court becoming marginalised by count Struensee, whose position as physician-in-ordinary to the mad King Christian VII made him the de facto ruler of Denmark during the first few years of the 1770s.

30862-key_.jpg	The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel, it is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Likely in charge of the entire project of the fresco decoration on the walls of the Sistine Chapel, Pietro Perugino retained for himself not only representations on the altar wall (which eventually were replaced by Michelangelo's Last Judgment) but also other significant scenes, such as Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter, a most fitting subject for Pope Sixtus' chapel. The fresco is located in the fifth compartment on the north wall.Among his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel the Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter is stylistically the most instructive. The main figures are organized in a frieze in two tightly compressed rows close to the surface of the picture and well below the horizon. The principal group, showing Christ handing the gold and silver keys to the kneeling St Peter, is surrounded by the other Apostles, including Judas (fifth figure to the left of Christ), all with halos, together with portraits of contemporaries, including one said to be a self-portrait (fifth from the right edge). The flat, open piazza is divided by coloured stones into large foreshortened rectangles, although they are not used in defining the spatial organization. Nor is the relationship between the figures and the felicitous invention of the porticoed Temple of Salomon that dominates the picture effectively resolved. The triumphal arches at the extremities appear as superfluous antiquarian references, suitable for a Roman audience. Scattered in the middle distance are two secondary scenes from the life of Christ, including the Tribute Money on the left and the Stoning of Christ on the right.The style of the figures is dependent upon Verrocchio. The active drapery, with its massive complexity, and the figures, particularly several apostles, including St John the Evangelist, with beautiful features, long flowing hair, elegant demeanour, and refinement recall St Thomas from Verrocchio's bronze group on Orsanmichele. The poses of the actors fall into a small number of basic attitudes that are consistently repeated, usually in reverse from one side to the other, signifying the use of the same cartoon. They are graceful and elegant figures who tend to stand firmly on the earth. Their heads are smallish in proportion to the rest of their bodies, and their features are delicately distilled with considerable attention to  minor detail.The octagonal temple with its ample porches that dominates the central axis must have had behind it a project created by an architect, but Perugino's treatment is like the rendering of a wooden model, painted with exactitude. The building with its arches serves as a backdrop in front of which the action unfolds. Perugino has made a significant contribution in rendering the landscape. The sense of an infinite world that stretches across the horizon is stronger than in almost any other work of his contemporaries, and the feathery trees against the cloud-filled sky with the bluish hills in the distance represent a solution that later painters would find instructive, especially Raphael

42847-11panta.jpg	St Pantaleon was such a famous doctor that Emperor Diocletian himself chose him for his own doctor. Pantaleon was a Christian, but the bad influence from the pagan court caused him to give up his Christian faith entirely. A holy priest made him realize what a sin he had committed. Pantaleon listened to him, detested his sin and joined the Church once more. To make up for what he had done, he greatly desired to suffer and die for Jesus. In the meantime, he imitated Our Lord's charity by taking care of poor sick people without any charge for his medical services.When the Emperor Diocletian began his persecution, Pantaleon was accused of being a Christian. He was given the choice of denying his Faith or being put to death. No torture could force Pantaleon to deny his Faith.In Veronese's painting we have a challenging confrontation of human medicine with divine, and the healing of the body with the healing of the soul. The good parish priest solicitously support the poisoned youth and seems to reiterate that the illumination of grace does not exempt the believer from the duty to perform good works

00523-1north.jpg	The end wall (the north wall) of the chancel chapel is devoted entirely to three scenes from the Passion of Christ: the Bearing of the Cross at bottom left, the Crucifixion in the middle, and the Descent into Hell at bottom right. The Crucifixion extends over the entire width of the upper wall segment as a multifigure image of Golgotha. In this scene the crosses of the two thieves create recessional axes into space, although the actual space depicted is relatively shallow. The thieves twist convulsively on their crosses while a group of figures runs from an attacking soldier at the right.The Crucifixion image derives from Sienese examples such as Simone Martini's fresco in the lower church  of San Francesco, Assisi, and Lippo Memmi's fresco in the Collegiata, San Gimignano.The thematic continuation of the Passion scenes is found on the vault frescoes in the Resurrection, the Miracle of Pentecost, and the Ascension of Christ

09097-virgin.jpg	Very little has been discovered as yet about the life and activity of Joos van Cleve, also known as Joos van der Beke, although some of his most important paintings have been firmly attributed and the sphere of his activity outlined, at least approximately. At one time he was known only as the Master of the Death of the Virgin, after a large altar in Cologne, and, since there were several painters surnamed van Cleve, his pictures have often been confused with their work.Joos was born in Bruges in the 1480s and worked in Antwerp from 1511 onwards. His altar-pieces and portraits were known and appreciated beyond the boundaries of the Netherlands, and he spent some time as a portrait painter at the court of Francis I, King of France. He was influenced by Leonardo and the Italian Renaissance painters, but in his religious compositions he mostly adhered to the great tradition of early Netherlandish painting handed down from Van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. This half-length Madonna is a late Gothic type, frequently found also in Memling's works. She faces the spectator and gives to her Child a glass of red wine symbolic of the Redemption. The colouring is brilliant, the fresh green of the landscape and the fiery red of the Virgin's mantle creating a lovely harmony

Each panel has a painted reverse, That of the man has a depiction of a roebuck, symbol of faithful love. The reverse of the woman is painted to imitate gilt bronze, but it is impossible to read the image because of surface damage.The original construction and function of these images, the identity of the sitters, and the meaning of the imagery is the subject of debate and further analysis.

18309-1108grec.jpg	The two paintings in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome (Adoration of the Shepherds, Baptism of Christ) were considered workshop pieces or autograph replicas of two of the three pictures that El Greco executed for the Colegio de Do&#241;a Mar�a de Arag�n in Madrid (now dispersed and housed in the Muzeul de Arta, Bucharest and the Museo del Prado, Madrid). However, a recent radiographic analysis (1997) has proven that they are original oil sketches by the hand of El Greco himself. The presence of pentimenti, compositional emendations beneath the paint surface, reveals the creative process of the artist and leads to the conclusion that these are not copies but preparatory bozzetti for the Madrid cycle. The important commission, probably designed as a triptych to decorate the high altar of the chapel, was given to El Greco in 1596: work continued until the Holy Year of 1600. The third oil sketch, depicting the Annunciation, is preserved at the museum in Bilbao.The silvery light, the coloristic range based on cold tones, the quick, almost impressionistic brushwork and the use of strong contrasts of light and shadow in this picture are all typical characteristics of El Greco's Spanish manner (1576-1614)

26524-3paolina.jpg	Between 1537 and 1540, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger built the Pauline Chapel in the Vatican, as Pope's (Paul III) private chapel. In 1541 Michelangelo was asked to decorate the central parts of the two longer walls with two frescoes. The first, The Conversion of Saint Paul, was begun in 1542; the second, the Martyrdom of St Peter, was painted between 1546 and 1550. Before this, no one had ever attempted to place these two themes next to each other. Michelangelo portrays what is by this time his plan of life: death for the faith must follow conversion and be its confirmation. To Paul, who has fallen and has been forced to shut his eyes because of the brilliance of divine light, he gives his own face and makes Peter, nailed to the cross, in the supreme tension of the last moment of life, forcefully look at the spectator

00588-08lasts1.jpg	One of Andrea del Castagno's most famous works is the Last Supper he painted below the stories from Christ's Passion. Until quite recently the Last Supper appeared to be painted in much darker colours than the scenes directly above it; the fact had given rise to many animated debates between scholars concerning the dating of the fresco. But after the latest cleaning (1977-79) the colour and tonal contrast between the two levels has disappeared, and the colours of the Last Supper have been restored to their original beauty.All scholars agree in praising the sobre architectural structure of the room where the scene of the Last Supper is taking place: a room in the austere style of Alberti, with the lavish coloured marble panels functioning as a backdrop to the heavy and solemn scene of the banquet. Notice also the beauty of some of the minor details, such as the gold highlights in some of the characters' hair or the haloes depicted in perfect perspective. The other extraordinary element of this fresco is the remarkable balance of gestures and expressions, particularly in the group of figures in the centre of the composition, where the innocent sleep of St John to the left of Jesus is contrasted to the tense, rigid figure of Judas sitting opposite.

13631-08ferenc.jpg	"The  first summer in Nagyb�nya resulted a large size composition of a biblical nature. The gloomy and splendid landscape inspired the painter to pass on a serious message. The three major elements of the composition  are a group of people in the foreground, light green leaves of the trees in the forest and monumental mountain chain the background. Critics concluded from the dominance of nature that in the case of this picture nature dominates man who is subordinated to it, although Ferenczy does not consider him insignificant. He emphasizes the group of people by applying various tools: they are placed in the foreground, formal connections are justified by content  and are the lightest strip as far as colour is concerned. Ferenczy was reported to have been preparing for this biblical topic very seriously. His family, friends and models accompanied him to the mountain he had selected and they  posed for his picture. The final version was predecessed by a lot of studies and sketches, as well as an oil sketch for the whole composition which was ready by 1896.The subject matter and the composition, however, still engaged him so he painted ""Sermon on the Hill"" in a second version where the figure of the man appearing in nature became even more accentuated. His figures were more condensed and became oversize. At the exhibition in 1903, the second version was presented which Ferenczy thought of as his final approach to the theme. The picture from 1897, however, survived in fragments. For reasons still unclear, its owner cut  it into pieces. Unfortunately, the  middle part was lost,  only its right and left sides have survived"

43580-2fortun2.jpg	A dark, handsome gypsy tells the fortune of a simpering young woman. Behind her a comic figure steals whatever the gypsy has hidden in her cloak, winking and signaling to an accomplice, who sports a ludicrously feathered fur hat and scraps of tattered finery. He points to the gypsy's victim, but she, despite her foolish look, seems to win the day, as she gestures toward the spectator, and invites him to enjoy the spectacle of the deceiver deceived.Vouet's painting, with its three-quarter length figures, owes much to Caravaggio and Manfredi, but it is more farcical in tone

23353-14gentl.jpg	Coming originally from Bergamo, Lorenzo Lotto soon abandoned Venice in search of fresh artistic experience in other cities of the Veneto, in Lombardy, Rome and the Marches. He was influenced for example by Antonello da Messina, Melozzo, D�rer, Raphael and Titian. In particular after his meditation on Lombard realism Lotto's painting, which never lent itself easily to rules of any kind, established an individual style based on a refined tension of compositional rhythms, a subtly natural light and a gentle blending of colours. Lotto's portraits achieve an extraordinary poetic quality and have a subtly autobiographical flavour about them with the at once melancholy and dreamy atmosphere which the subjects inhabit. One of the very finest of Lotto's portraits is this Young Gentleman in his Study.The pale young man with his finely tapered face, is obviously a lover of both music and hunting, witness the mandola and the hunting horn hanging from the piece of furniture on the right, and is caught here in a moment of yearning thoughtfulness as his fingers leaf absent-mindedly through the pages of a large book. The natural light, entering through an invisible window, highlights the vibrant blacks and greys of his garments, the pale pink tones of his flesh and the blues of the table and just manages to penetrate the dark of the background in subdued illumination of the objects there, the finely turned ink-stand and the keys on the sideboard. The human figure too with its lack of any strong emotion, seems to participate in the arcane calm of this stupendous still life, the recently opened letter, the slow dropping of the rose petals, the silk shawl from whose folds darts a lizard. Such searching after human truth, veiled with melancholy, is at quite the opposite pole from the dignified idealization pursued by Titian in the portraits he painted at about the same time

37209-maesta_s.jpg	After a few years of Duccio's Maest&#224;, Simone painted his Maest&#224; for the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, as the ideal of the good and just government. This is the oldest painting that can be safely attributed to him. The end wall of the Sala del Mappamondo is entirely covered by this fresco. Surrounded by a frame decorated with twenty medallions depicting the Blessing Christ, the Prophets and the Evangelists and with smaller shields containing the coat-of-arms of Siena, the fresco shows a host of angels, Saints and Apostles, with the Madonna and Child in the centre. The whole scene, set against a deep blue background, is surmounted by an imposing canopy of red silk.The most obvious innovations present in Simone's style are his ideas of three-dimensional space. The supporting poles of the canopy are placed in perspective, thus giving a sense of depth to the composition. Under the canopy there is a crowd of thirty people: no more processions of people in parallel rows, but concrete spacial rhythms and animated gestures

12303-2crevole.jpg	The Crevole Madonna and the Madonna of Buonconvento are unanimously considered the earliest works attributable to Duccio. The basic approach of the two paintings is of evident Byzantine tradition: the elegant stylization of the hands, the typical downward curving nose, the red maph�rion under Mary's veil, the dark drapery animated by shining gilded lines. New details appear, to a lesser extent in the Buonconvento Madonna and repeated with greater confidence in the Crevole painting, such as the subtle play of light on the Virgin's face, over her chin and cheeks, and a clear attempt at plasticism in the folds of the garment around the face.The more carefully considered compositon of the Crevole Madonna shows a faint but decided French influence: the elegant forms of the angels in the upper corners, the veiled transparency of the Child's garment, held up by a curious knotted cord, and most of all, the intimate gesture of the Infant Jesus, held in a tender embrace

21492-andrea1.jpg	The picture shows the paintings in the crossing cupola of Sant'Andrea della Valle: Assumption of the Virgin by Giovanni Lanfranco (in the cupola); The Four Evangelists by Domenichino (in the pendentives). At the bottom of the picture the antechoir vault with the First Calling of Andrew and Peter by Domenichino can be seen.Sant'Andrea della Valle is the general seat for the religious order of the Theatines. Its construction started 1593 under the designs of Giacomo della Porta and Pier Paolo Olivieri, and under the patronage of Cardinal Gesualdo. With the prior patron's death, direction of the church passed to Cardinal Alessandro Peretti di Montalto, nephew of Sixtus V. By 1608, work restarted anew with a more grandiose plan, mainly by Carlo Maderno. The interior structure of the church was finally completed by 1666, with additional touches added by Francesco Grimaldi (1560-after 1626). The Baroque fa�ade was added between 1655 and 1663 by Carlo Rainaldi, at the expense of Cardinal Francesco Peretti di Montalto, nephew of Alessandro.One of the greatest challenges to confront Roman religious painting in the first half of the seventeenth century was the decoration of the Sant'Andrea della Valle. The structure of the church competed architecturally and in its urban setting with the two most important sixteenth-century Roman religious structures, namely Saint peter's, with its similar tall drum cupola visible from afar, and Il Ges&#249;, which provided the pattern for its longitudinal structure flanked by chapels. With the painting of choir and the cupola of Sant'Andrea these prototypes were outdone, for at that time neither Saint Peter's nor Il Ges&#249; had any high-quality painted decoration. Accordingly, Sant'Andrea della Valle set a new standard, and introduced an epoch of Roman monumental painting that would culminate a half-century later in two simultaneous Jesuit commissions (in Sant'Ignazio di Loyola).Domenichino was commissioned in 1622 to paint the choir. Originally he was supposed to take over the entire painted decoration of the church, however, the commission for the cupola was given to Giovanni Lanfranco instead. This led to a breach between the two former workshop assistants of Annibale Carracci. Both Domenichino's pictures in the choir calotte and Lanfranco's cupola were completed in 1628.Mattia Preti was commissioned in 1650 to paint the nave of the church. The commission included four pictures in the nave vault and the compartments above the windows. Additional contracts in the same year obliged the painter the paint three scenes from the life of St Andrew on the wall of the choir, and pictures on the wall of the antechoir. The paintings on the nave vault were not realised

44739-assembly.jpg	This painting was painted for Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici in 1575-6, as part of a set of nine coppers intended for a cabinet or writing-desk (studiolo) in the Cardinal's bedroom in the Villa Medici, Rome. The present copper is the only surviving piece of the set.The subject of the painting has been variously identified as The Assembly of the Gods or The Birth of Minerva. Upper centre sits Jupiter, King of the gods, from whose head Minerva has just been born. To the left and right of him are Neptune, Mars, Apollo, Venus, Mercury and Diana (or Luna) who holds up the moon. The bearded figure lower right, larger in scale and apparently holding the whole group on his shoulders, is probably Atlas and in the lower left corner Vesta, goddess of Mother Nature, is shown guarded by a corbante and sitting above Pluto, god of the Underworld. In the centre are Neptune and Juno, with a peacock at her feet, and upper left seated on a cloud are Ceres and Flora with two satyrs (possibly representing the Four Seasons)

26127-35tondo.jpg	Another autograph version of this small painting is in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Both tondos are roughly the same size and their composition is probably based on a lost tondo by the Master of Fl�malle with the same dimensions. There is a whole series of versions of roughly the same type and format. In some cases the Virgin is facing to the left and in others to the right, which suggests the use of cartoons or tracings. The example closest in style to Fl�malle, which might be a fairly faithful copy of the prototype, is a version facing to the right in Philadelphia. This tondo prototype was derived in turn from the life-sized Virgin of Frankfurt (St&#228;delsches Kunstinstitut), a key work of the Master of Fl�malle.Comparison indicates that Memling's version follows the Philadelphia type very faithfully, in terms of both pose and details of costume. The dark background has been replaced by a golden ground speckled in red, and the style has been transposed. The work can, in fact, be viewed as a stylistically translated copy. This little painting displays all the characteristics of Memling's autograph work, including the brushwork, the typology and the underdrawing. The golden background and obsolescent typology give the work an archaic air. Nevertheless, closer examination reveals that it is rather related to Memling's later works. The less precise technique, for instance, with its visible brushstrokes strongly resembles the works in Granada. The facial type and the Child's hand also match those in the Granada Virgin and Child Enthroned. The face can be compared too with that of Bathsheba's servant girl, although the latter is bigger

25214-trinity.jpg	The small picture is an early work of the Master of the Votive Picture of Sankt Lambrecht, who for a long time was known to scholars by the name of Hans von T�bingen.In front of the golden background, which also extends over the frame, God the Father is supporting the tortured body of the dead Christ by His armpits. Though dead, Christ holds up His pierced right hand. The Dove of the Holy Ghost is hovering between them. Six angels are fluttering around the figures of the Holy Trinity, their gestures being directed towards Christ. The role of the Father is twofold. On the one hand, He is taking His Son back, thus accepting his sacrifice for mankind. Yet, the very same gesture serves to present and recommend this offering. This type of representation had developed in the surroundings of the French and Burgundian courts. In fact a tondo showing the same theme, by Jean Malouel, may have had a direct influence on the Vienna master. This is evinced not only by the iconographic resemblance of the two pictures; the memory of the round painting by Malouel may also have contributed to the composition of the Vienna panel. The representation seems to be opening up like a funnel from the green drapery of the bottom right corner. The helpless falling forward of the body of Christ appears to create a vortex, which sweeps the angels along too: it pushes away the one in the bottom right corner, while the one in the turquoise blue robe collapses backwards as though fainting. The symmetrical axis of the composition is the diagonal line running from the bottom right to the top left corner; the figures of Christ and of God the Father diverge at equal distances; the two angels in red also look like mirrored images of each other. The representation itself becomes condensed in the triangle under the other diagonal line.The almost tactile modelling of the bodies and the fact that not even the interpretation of the angels and of the Holy Ghost is stylized, but is based as much as possible on observed experience, are signs pointing to a further development of painting

31081-0view.jpg	"The ChapelThe painting of the main choir chapel (Cappella Maggiore) of the Franciscan church in Arezzo was undertaken in accordance with a provision in a will written some forty years earlier, one that seems to presume even earlier patronage rights to the chapel. The coat of arms of the Bacci family, dating from the fifteenth century, can be seen on either side of the entry arch. The chapel itself was built between 1366 and 1374. In 1408 the owner of patronage rights to it was the spice merchant Baccio di Masi Bacci, who in that year drew up his first will designating the church of San Francesco as his final resting place.The work on a fresco cycle in the Cappella Maggiore of the church San Francesco had already begun in 1452 when Piero della Francesca visited the city. The Florentine painter Bicci di Lorenzo was working in the chapel, he died in 1452, leaving the decoration of the chapel barely begun. Piero probably began to work right after Bicci's death, covering in a few years the walls of the Gothic chapel with the most modern and most advanced - in terms of perspective - frescoes that the Italian 15th century could have created.The 13th century Crucifix with Saint Francis was already in the church when Piero della Francesca frescoed the chapel; it has been recently placed above the main altar.The FrescoesThe subject-matter of the stories illustrated by Piero is drawn from Jacobus de Voragine's ""Golden Legend"", a 13th century text that recounts the miraculous story of the wood of Christ's Cross. The story tells how Adam, on his deathbed, sends his son Seth to Archangel Michael, who gives him some seedlings from the tree original sin to be placed in his father's mouth at the moment of his death. The tree that grows on the patriarch's grave is chopped down by King Solomon and its wood, which could not be used for anything else, is thrown across a stream to serve as a bridge. The Queen of Sheba, on her journey to see Solomon and hear his words of wisdom, is about to cross the stream, when by a miracle she learns that the Saviour will be crucified on that wood. She kneels in devout adoration. When Solomon discovers the nature of the divine message received by the Queen of Sheba, he orders that the bridge be removed and the wood, which will cause the end of the kingdom of the Jews, be buried. But the wood is found and, after a second premonitory message, becomes the instrument of the Passion.Three centuries later, just before the battle of Ponte Milvio against Maxentius, Emperor Constantine is told in a dream, that he must fight in the name of the Cross to overcome his enemy. After Constantine's victory, his mother Helena travels to Jerusalem to recover the miraculous wood. No one knows where the relic of the Cross is, except a Jew called Judas. Judas is tortured in a well and confesses that he knows the temple where the three crosses of Calvary are hidden. Helena orders that the temple be destroyed; the three crosses are found and the True Cross is recognized because it causes the miraculous resurrection of a dead youth. In the year 615, the Persian King Chosroes steals the wood, setting it up as an object of worship. The Eastern Emperor Heraclius wages war on the Persian King and, having defeated him, returns to Jerusalem with the Holy Wood. But a divine power prevents the emperor from making his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. So Heraclius, setting aside all pomp and magnificence, enters the city carrying the Cross in a gesture of humility, following Jesus Christ's example.The scenes of the cycle:1. Death of Adam2. Procession of the Queen of Sheba; Meeting between the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon3. Burial of the Holy Wood4. Vision of Constantine5. Constantine's Victory over Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge6. Torture of the Jew7. Finding and Recognition of the True Cross8. Battle between Heraclius and Chosroes9. Exaltation of the CrossAnnunciationAngelsProphet"

29868-virtue.jpg	"The triptych, which was very likely commissioned by Margaret of Austria, the governor of the Low Countries, depicts two biblical episodes illustrating the virtues of patience: the Book of Job and the parable of Lazarus the beggar and the rich man. Since the Middle Ages it had been common practice to draw a parallel between the resignation of Job and of Lazarus in the face of misfortune and the constancy of their faith in God.On the inside of the triptych, the story of Job begins on the left wing. Whilst in heaven Satan proposes to God to test the faith of this wealthy man, the faithful servant of Good, the first calamities rain down. Job's entire flocks are led off by the Sabeans. On the central panel, the unleashed forces of evil bring down the palace, killing Job's sons and daughters. The painter accentuates the dramatic character of the scene by numerous foreshortenings and obliques, which have the effect of pushing the picture towards the spectator. In the background countryside scene, we see Job himself sacrificing to God; to the right, naked and covered with sores, he is being cursed by his wife. On the right inner wing, Job has recovered his earlier wealth and descends the steps of his palace towards his former friends who implore his intercession.Van Orley creates his masterpiece by marrying the Flemish tradition with the new directions of Italian art and his own inventiveness. The result is a veritable profession of faith in the Renaissance, underlined by the artist's motto, ""Elx syne tyt"" (each in his time) inscribed on the pillar to the left of the central panel"

06683-v_lawyex.jpg	This is one of the most popular compositions of Pieter Brueghel the Younger. In contrast with the majority of his compositions, it is not derived from one of his father's work, it probably has a French origin. Known in numerous versions, of which some twenty-five are considered autograph, the earliest dated version is from the year 1615.  Brueghel produced the composition in two sizes, the smaller format measuring approximately 55 by 87 cm, and the larger format, such as the present example, measuring approximately 76 by 123 cm. The overall design was done from a tracing and so remains largely the same in the various versions.  However, Brueghel modified his use of colour and tone from one work to another.

42623-27redhat.jpg	Signature: Monogram(?) upper left.Provenance: The painting is only known since a Paris sale of 1822, in which it was described as a work by Vermeer van Delft. It was sold for 200 French francs. Subsequently: collection Baron Atthalin, Colmar; collection Baron Laurent Atthalin; art gallery Knoedler, New York, 1925; collection Andrew W. Mellon, Washington. Since 1937, in the museum.In this painting Vermeer repeated the posture of the arm in The Girl with a Flute, though she is seen from the other side, and is therefore leaning on her right arm, against the backrest of a chair decorated with lions' heads and rings. This picture was quite evidently painted with the aid of a camera obscura. That is indicated by his use of pointillism, bright dots of paint and occasional highlights on the folds. The light is falling at an angle from above onto her soft, feathery hat; on the top it is vermilion, and the lower shadowed part is a dark purple colour. The intensity of the light is such that the hat appears, at points, to be transparent. Its broad brim has the effect of casting a shadow over most of her face; only her left cheek, below her eye, is lit. The shading of her eyes, the centre of her face, is quite intentional; the principle of dissimulatio, a mysterious disguise, is being applied here, the intended effect being to heighten our curiosity.It is assumed by some critics that this painting is not by Vermeer, but a later pasticcio. It, and the Girl with a Flute (in the same museum) are painted on wood, whereas all authentic Vermeer paintings are done on canvas. This work has been painted on an upside-down Rembrandtesque portrait of a man, and pigments considered to be older than the nineteenth century found in this painting come from the original and not from the modern pasticcio

Two Boys Blowing Bubbles ranks among Netscher's most engaging paintings of children. The young lad in the background blows a bubble while his older playmate gazes at one floating above. Two seashells and a very ornate silver tazza (which expertly reproduces one fabricated by the renowned silversmith Adam van Vianen in 1618) lie on the ledge before the boys.The motif of bubble blowing in Dutch art is traditionally associated with the Latin expression, ""Homo Bulla"" (Man is Like a Bubble).

26172-1bay1.jpg	The Annunciation scene is located in the lunette of the first bay in the north aisle of the Collegiata, San Gimignano. The scene takes place in a rectangular interior that offers a striking contrast to the pointed arch of the lunette. With bowed head and hands clasped at his chest, the angel kneels before the seated Virgin, who pulls back in surprise. Behind Mary a drawn curtain reveals her sleeping chamber. God the Father and an aureole of angels fill the sky visible above this starkly outlined interior. The right side shows an adjoining room in which a maid sits holding a distaff. This motif undoubtedly originated in Giotto's depiction of the Annunciation to St Anne in Padua

02934-susanna.jpg	The theme of Susanna and the Elders was very well-known in Venice by the end of the sixteenth century, but not in Rome. It seems likely that its increased popularity in the Eternal City was the direct result of Annibale Carracci and his school. Annibale had made a print of Susanna and the Elders before he left Bologna, and in Rome he took up the theme again in a lost painting described by Bellori. Sisto Badalocchio's monumental figures are similar to those in Annibale's print, although Susanna is more clearly derived from antique examples of the Crouching Venus. The normal garden setting and fountain in which Susanna bathes have been reduced to the bare minimum; only a few trees and a classical pedestal suggest the rest. Thus the figures, which are close to life-size, have a commanding psychological presence and the palpability of Susanna's semi-nude body seems all the more sexually arousing.Because of the inscription 'A.CAR.BON.F.', the picture has been variously attributed to Annibale, Agostino, and Antonio Carracci. However, none of these artists is known to have signed works solely with the initial `A'. By 1657, when the picture was recorded in the collection of Donna Olimpia Aldobrandini, it had already been taken off its stretcher, strongly suggesting that it was not by an artist of Annibale's stature (or perhaps that the subject was considered too provocative). The signature was first recorded in the nineteenth century and technical evidence suggests that it floats on the surface. It was therefore probably added at a later date to enhance the value of the painting.In 1602 Badalocchio was sent by the Duke of Parma to study with Annibale in Rome, where he remained until the master's death in 1609. His Roman works, such as the Susanna and the Hartford Holy Family, unite the grandeur of Annibale's style with a pictorial richness of colour and light that reflects Badalocchio's Emilian background. The plump, round faces and relief-like effect of the drapery's sinuous folds are similar in both pictures. The compact grouping of the figures around a recessive diagonal is also more characteristic of Badalocchio than of any of the members of the Carracci family

42132-13duomo.jpg	Domes, which vault the crossing and altar of countless churches, lend themselves well to being transformed into paintings of the sky. The round shape above our heads seems to  open onto a higher world, so that God and the things of heaven become visually present at the church holiest spot.The Last Judgment in the enormous dome of the cathedral in Florence was painted from 1572 onward. Vincenzo Borghini had drawn up a learned theological program as early as 1570, Giorgio Vasari was responsible for executing it, but he died in 1574. Federico Zuccaro completed the frescoes in 1575-79. High up in the fresco in the dome, around the cupola, hovers a temple with the twenty-four elders of the Apocalypse; beneath this, on terraced registers, follow choirs of angels with the instruments of the Passion, then groups of saints, then personifications of the gifts of the Holy SXpirit, of the virtues, and of the beatitudes, and finally the regions of hell with various deadly sins. The composition of the fresco thus takes into account the architectonic form of the vault in its eight sections, hard upon one another. There is no attempt to dissolve the architectural structure completely by means of illusionistic painting.The temple and the zones of heaven for four of the eight sections of the vault were completed under Vasari's direction

27082-pictura.jpg	Frans van Mieris the Elder was after Dou the principal representative of the Leiden school of 'fijnschilders'. Apparently by the time he was born his parents stopped keeping track of the number of children they produced; he is vaguely mentioned as one of the last of twenty-three. Mieris studied with Dou, and the latter acknowledged him as the 'crown prince of his students'. The characterization is still valid. Mieris fell heir to Dou's technique and compositions.Like his teacher, he was extremely popular with the wealthy collectors of his time. He received important commissions from Grand Duke Cosimo III de' Medici and Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. The latter invited him to work at his court in Vienna. He turned down the offer and, as far as we know, spent his life in his native town. A review of his oeuvre brings to mind the work of many of his contemporaries, although he always manages to keep his own personality, particularly his impeccable, highly polished finish which had a lasting effect on later painters with a passion for 'fine painting'.Exemplary of his refined technique is Pictura of 1661. Done on copper, the tiny picture follows more or less the formula Cesare Ripa gives in his Iconologia for representing the art of painting: 'A beautiful woman ... with a golden chain around her neck, on which hangs a face mask ... [with] brushes in one hand, and in the other a palette, dressed in a lustrous garment ...' Among the attributes Ripa prescribes for the allegorical representation of Pictura that Mieris thankfully omits are the inscription 'Imitatio' written on the woman's forehead and a bound cloth over her mouth. We have seen that a few years later Vermeer also turned to Ripa's Iconologia for his Art of Painting and Allegory of Faith and that he did not follow the iconographer's instructions to the letter either

43018-baptism.jpg	Commissioned by the monastery church of San Salvi in Florence, where remained until 1530, the picture was executed in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio, whose style is well defined by the figures of Christ and Baptist. The special fame of the work is however due to the Verrocchio's pupil who helped him paint the picture: in the blond angel on the left and in the landscape above is in fact recognizable the hand of Leonardo, the very young Leonardo, present in Verrocchio's workshop around 1470. Some critics ascribe the second angel to another young Florentine artist, Sandro Botticelli.St John the Baptist baptizes Jesus by pouring water over his head. The extended arms of God, the golden rays, the dove with outstretched wings and the cruciform nimbus show that Jesus is the Son of God and part of the Trinity. Two angels on the riverbank are holding Jesus' garment. The composition is attributed to Verrocchio, although there can be no definite answer as to which artist produced it

18590-1view1c.jpg	The picture shows the central panel of the first view of the Isenheim Altarpiece.Art for Gr�newald did not consist in the search for the hidden laws of beauty - for him it could have only one aim, the aim of all religious art in the Middle Ages - that of providing a sermon in pictures, of proclaiming the sacred truths as taught by the Church. The central panel of the Isenheim altarpiece shows that he sacrificed all other considerations to this one overriding aim. Of beauty, as the Italian artists saw it, there is none in the stark and cruel picture of the crucified Saviour. Like a preacher at Passiontide, Gr�newald left nothing undone to bring home to us the horrors of this scene of suffering: Christ's dying body is distorted by the torture of the cross; the thorns of the scourges stick in the festering wounds which cover the whole figure. The dark red blood forms a glaring contrast to the sickly green of the flesh. By His features and the impressive gesture of His hands, the Man of Sorrows speaks to us of the meaning of His Calvary.His suffering is reflected in the traditional group of Mary, in the garb of a widow, fainting in the arms of St John the Evangelist, to whose care the Lord has commended her, and in the smaller figure of St Mary Magdalene with her vessel of ointments, wringing her hands in sorrow. On the other side of the Cross, there stands the powerful figure of St John the Baptist with the ancient symbol of the lamb carrying the cross and pouring out its blood into the chalice of the Holy Communion. With a stern and commanding gesture he points towards the Saviour, and over him are written the words that he speaks (according to the gospel of St John iii. 30): 'He must increase, but I must decrease.'There is little doubt that the artist wanted the beholder of the altar to meditate on these words, which he emphasized so strongly by the pointing hand of St John the Baptist. Perhaps he even wanted us to see how Christ must grow and we diminish. For in this picture, in which reality seems to be depicted in all its unmitigated horror, there is one unreal and fantastic trait: the figures differ greatly in size. We need only compare the hands of St Mary Magdalene under the Cross with those of Christ to become fully aware of the astonishing difference in their dimensions. It is clear that in these matters Gr�newald rejected the rules of modern art as it had developed since the Renaissance, and that he deliberately returned to the principles of medieval and primitive painters, who varied the size of their figures according to their importance in the picture. Just as he had sacrificed the pleasing kind of beauty for the sake of the spiritual lesson of the altar, he also disregarded the new demand for correct proportions, since this helped him to express the mystic truth of the words of St John

(The group included, besides Lastman Jan Pynas, Jacob Pynas, Jan Tengnagel, Cornelisz Moeyart, and Fran�ois Venant.)

12582-5empero2.jpg	In 1518, D�rer went to the Diet of Augsburg following a delegation of dignitaries from Nuremberg. On that occasion, he did the portrait of Jakob Fugger (Staatsgalerie, Augsburg) and also one in a half-bust of the emperor, then fifty-nine. It is a pencil drawing carried out on 28 June (as indicated by the inscription on the same paper).Shortly thereafter, probably still during his sojourn in Augsburg, he did a second portrait, still in a half-bust, but this time painted on canvas: D�rer probably preferred canvas to panel because it simplified the execution, for the painting as well as for the transportation. This painting, now in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, did not have the inscription on parchment, which was added only after the emperor's death on 12 January 1519.

36872-2reale.jpg	During his fifty-year reign (1680-1730) Vittorio Amadeo II transformed Turin, the second royal residence on Italian soil after Naples, into one of the most splendid Baroque cities in Europe. In 1584 he started the enlargement of the palace known as the Palazzo Reale. The additions to the palace were patterned after the models of French court architecture, but for the wall decorations he looked for Italian painters.The gallery of the east wing served as the official entr�e to the chambers of Vittorio Amadeo II. It was painted by Daniel Seiter, and the room was later named after him. The main subject of the ceiling is the Apotheosis of a Hero (Vittorio Amadeo II). The centre section depicts a theatrically posed young man in the presence of Jupiter, who by presenting him with a golden apple promises a royal future for his family. The young man, though dressed in the manner of a classical hero, is generally thought to represent Vittorio Amadeo II

09031-07delos.jpg	The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 179).In the last ten years of his life Claude painted six stories of Aeneas, hero of Virgil's Aeneid - the Latin epic describing the legendary origins of Rome. The theme seems to have been suggested by Claude himself. He chose scenes which had never been illustrated before; they do not form a series, nor were they painted in the order in which they appear in the Aeneid. As if echoing Virgil's 'I am that man who in times past tuned my song on the slender reed [of pastoral poetry]', the painter turned, at the age of 68, to sing the voyages of the survivor 'fated to be an exile...the first to sail from the land of Troy and reach Italy'. These six Aeneas pictures, of which Aeneas at Delos is the first, represent Claude's most personal achievement, attaining a nobility of style visually equivalent to the grandeur of Virgil's poem.Throughout the 1640s and 1650s Claude had often illustrated Ovid's Metamorphoses, and it may be through the Metamorphoses that his interest in Aeneas' adventures was first aroused. In Book XIII Ovid relates the hero's flight from burning Troy; Claude's painting is based more closely on this passage than on Virgil's description in Book III of the Aeneid. Ovid tells how - taking with him sacred images of the gods, his father Anchises (the bearded man in blue) and his son Ascanius (the child on the right) Aeneas (in short red cloak):set sail...and...reached with his friends the city of Apollo [Delos]. Anius [in white on the left], who ruled over men as king and served the sun god as his priest, received him in the temple and his home. He showed his city, the new-erected shrines and the two sacred trees [olive and palm] to which Latona had once clung when she gave birth to her children [Diana and Apollo].The stone relief atop the portico in the foreground represents Diana and Apollo slaying the giant Tityus, who tried to ravish their mother.This is one of the most evocative pictures ever painted. The figures, elongated perhaps in the belief that the ancients were taller than we, are dwarfed by the sacred trees and the majestic buildings. Apollo's round temple recreates the original appearance of the Pantheon, reminding us of the Delian oracle's prophecy of Rome's future splendour. Meditation on time is at the very heart of the painting. A dual longing, for both the Trojan past and Aeneas' future as founder of Rome, is embedded in the perspectival construction. The projecting lines of the architecture meet at the level of the horizon to the left of the canvas, while the lines of the road converge to the right

05284-02lastju.jpg	"This vast panoramic nightmare represents the earth in her final death throes, destroyed not by water as D�rer and Leonardo were to envision it, but by the fire foretold in a thirteenth-century hymn, the sombre Dies Irae: ""Day of Wrath, that day when the world dissolves in glowing ashes"". Bosch was probably also influenced by the account of the last days given in the Revelation of St John, a book which enjoyed renewed popularity in the late fifteenth century, when it was illustrated by D�rer in his famous Apocalypse woodcuts of 1497-98. The wide valley dominating the central panel may represent the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which, on the basis of several Old Testament references (Joel 4:2,12), was traditionally thought to be the site of the Last Judgment, with the walls of the earthly Jerusalem blazing in the background. In any event, earth has become indistinguishable from Hell, depicted on the right wing, out of which the army of Satan swarms to attack the damned; the eternity of torment has begun.The Hell scene in the Prado Tabletop had paired off each punishment with one of the Deadly Sins. In the Last Judgment it would be difficult to identify the punishments with specific sins. The avaricious are boiled in the great cauldron just visible beneath one of the buildings in the central panel. Around the corner, a fat glutton is forced to drink from a barrel held by two devils; the source of his dubious refreshment can be seen squatting in the window overhead. The lascivious woman on the roof above suffers the attentions of a lizard-like monster slithering across her loins, while being serenaded by two musical demons. On the cliffs to the right, across the river, blacksmith-devils hammer other victims on anvils, and one is being shod like a horse; these unfortunate souls are guilty of the sin of anger"

32829-athens.jpg	The School of Athens is a depiction of philosophy. The scene takes place in classical times, as both the architecture and the garments indicate. Figures representing each subject that must be mastered in order to hold a true philosophic debate - astronomy, geometry, arithmetic, and solid geometry - are depicted in concrete form. The arbiters of this rule, the main figures, Plato and Aristotle, are shown in the centre, engaged in such a dialogue.The School of Athens represents the truth acquired through reason. Raphael does not entrust his illustration to allegorical figures, as was customary in the 14th and 15th centuries. Rather, he groups the solemn figures of thinkers and philosophers together in a large, grandiose architectural framework. This framework is characterized by a high dome, a vault with lacunar ceiling and pilasters. It is probably inspired by late Roman architecture or - as most critics believe - by Bramante's project for the new St Peter's which is itself a symbol of the synthesis of pagan and Christian philosophies.The figures who dominate the composition do not crowd the environment, nor are they suffocated by it. Rather, they underline the breadth and depth of the architectural structures. The protagonists - Plato, represented with a white beard (some people identify this solemn old man with Leonardo da Vinci) and Aristotle - are both characterized by a precise and meaningful pose. Raphael's descriptive capacity, in contrast to that visible in the allegories of earlier painters, is such that the figures do not pay homage to, or group around the symbols of knowledge; they do not form a parade. They move, act, teach, discuss and become excited.The painting celebrates classical thought, but it is also dedicated to the liberal arts, symbolized by the statues of Apollo and Minerva. Grammar, Arithmetic and Music are personified by figures located in the foreground, at left. Geometry and Astronomy are personified by the figures in the foreground, at right. Behind them stand characters representing Rhetoric and Dialectic. Some of the ancient philosophers bear the features of Raphael's contemporaries. Bramante is shown as Euclid (in the foreground, at right, leaning over a tablet and holding a compass). Leonardo is, as we said, probably shown as Plato. Francesco Maria Della Rovere appears once again near Bramante, dressed in white. Michelangelo, sitting on the stairs and leaning on a block of marble, is represented as Heraclitus. A close examination of the intonaco shows that Heraclitus was the last figure painted when the fresco was completed, in 1511. The allusion to Michelangelo is probably a gesture of homage to the artist, who had recently unveiled the frescoes of the Sistine Ceiling. Raphael - at the extreme right, with a dark hat - and his friend, Sodoma, are also present (they exemplify the glorification of the fine arts and they are posed on the same level as the liberal arts).The fresco achieved immediate success. Its beauty and its thematic unity were universally accepted. The enthusiasm with which it was received was not marred by reservations, as was the public reaction to the Sistine Ceiling

34240-coastal.jpg	A calm sea stretches the full width of the painting. The beach in the foreground is populated with numerous small figures: two horsemen, a merchant with his servants and assistants, a small group of swimmers. A high, straight embankment, at a right angle to the beach, runs from the left side of the scene well past the middle. Above the wall the profile of a city can be distinguished. A ruined tower dominates the left side of the composition. Standing on an embankment parallel to the spit of land, the tower is evidently inhabited by the woman hanging her laundry out of the large upper window. Ships lie at anchor on the right.The nearly horizontal bands of the beach, the spit of land, the enbankment and the horizon predominate. The tower functions as a vertical accent and the ships on the right as its counterweight. The scene is bathed in a delicate, clear light, under a pale blue sky with lightly accented pink clouds. The city emerges through a warm, light haze. The greyish-green water reflects the white sails of the ships. The deeper browns, reds and blues in the foreground contrast with these delicate pastel hues.The handling of light in particular foreshadows the art of Canaletto. But the vedutisti also further developed the broad horizontality of the composition in their paintings. Canaletto almost never painted horizons that were as open as the one in this work, but Francesco Guardi did, especially in his late views of the Lagoon.The light and the individual motifs in this canvas evince the inspiration Ricci drew from seventeenth-century Dutch art. The work of Italianate painters such as Jan Both or Jan Asselijn comes to mind, but also of specialists in northern coastal views such as Ludolf Bakhuyzen and Jan van de Cappelle. Ricci may have become acquainted with their work in England, where he twice stayed: once between 1708 and 1710, and again from 1712 till 1716.Marco Ricci most often painted Arcadian landscapes, whether or not with classical ruins. For Canaletto, Ricci's paintings of ruins in particular were an important model. Though views such as this one are exceptional for him, the Coastal View with Tower is one of Riccfs finest accomplishments

07522-25conta.jpg	The picture shows the first version of the St Matthew and the Angel, executed for the Contarelli Chapel in the San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome.  This painting was rejected, and the artist made another one which still stands over the altar today. The first version of the St Matthew and the Angel was purchased by Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani and then ended up in Berlin, where it was destroyed in the Second World War; no color reproduction exists.The slow-witted figure of St Matthew, who is naked below below his knees and elbows, and dressed in an ordinary cowl, acquires no real dignity even though the mantle laid over his folding-chair. With his eyes wide open, and with heavy hands, he peers into the thick volumes on his knee. It is not easy to believe he can write. His angel has the greatest difficulty in leading his untrained hand to put the word of God into letters, which are far too big. In doing so, the angel inclines his charming figure, whose shape can clearly be seen beneath his light garment. And so can his androgynous face and long locks of hair, in contrast to the rough bald skull of St Matthew. Against the almost black background, which has been trimmed on the left and at the top, we see the exquisite white of his enormous wings

14135-022diana.jpg	The subject, Diana and Endymion, was a popular one. The story: Endymion, sent to sleep for ever by the command of Jupiter, in return for being granted perpetual youth, was visited nightly by the goddess Diana. The beautiful youth, Endymion, who fell into an eternal sleep, has captured the imagination of poets and artists as a symbol of the timelessness of beauty that is 'a joy forever'.This early masterpiece by Fragonard demonstrates his brilliant command - even at the beginning of his career - of the Rococo pictorial idiom that was in ascendancy in the 1750s and that he absorbed through his close relationship with Fran�ois Boucher. With its pendant Aurora (private collection) Diana and Endymion was intended as interior decorations, undoubtedly meant to be installed into the paneling of overdoors

19679-townhal.jpg	When Jan van der Heyden portrayed the new Town Hall of Amsterdam in 1667, the exterior of the building had just been completed. Between 1662 and 1665 the dome had risen over the entrance, making it possible to see the majestic building from any point in the city. Amsterdammers were extremely proud of their Town Hall, a pride eloquently expressed in Van der Heyden's painting.The middle distance is dominated by the Town Hall's bright fa�ade, seen from the south. In the left foreground the house called De Vergulde Ploeg' [The Gilded Plough] is shown at the north corner of Kalverstraat and Dam Square. The Nieuwe Kerk and the adjacent house at the corner of Eggertstraat close off the composition. Spreading out in front of the Town Hall is the Dam Square itself, the open space at the heart of the city and the centre of its political, economic and religious life. (The figures populating Dam Square may have been painted by Adriaen van de Velde, who often provided staffage for the works of other artists.) The square's irregular shape allowed artists to depict it from a variety of view-points.Van der Heyden subjected his composition to a rigorous central perspective construction with a single vanishing point, just next to the Nieuwe Kerk on the right. This resulted in a strict, diagonal arrangement of the image and also several remarkable distortions. The fa�ade of the Town Hall is so foreshortened that the building seems to wobble, as if it might fall forward. This effect is primarily caused by the distortion of the lantern, which, while it is entirely correct as far as the perspective is concerned, is unacceptable to the eye. In constructing the perspective Van der Heyden may possibly have used a camera obscura, as central perspective constructions and lenses cause similar aberrations.Cosimo de' Medici acquired Van der Heyden's picture in 1668 during a visit to Amsterdam. Correspondence has survived concerning Cosimo's efforts to acquire a second painting from Van der Heyden in 1672. From it we learn that the artist acknowledged a glaring 'imperfezione' in his rendering of the lantern in the first painting, one he had not been able to correct with his brush. Thus, Van der Heyden had attached a metal rod to the frame, indicating the point from where the painting could be seen without any distortion.That Van der Heyden was well aware of the distortion becomes apparent from another version of the same subject (now in the Mus�e du Louvre, Paris) that he completed shortly after the first painting. Here the viewpoint is somewhat further to the right and the perspective is different; the foreshortening of the Town Hall's fa�ade is less pronounced, and the lantern's distortion has been corrected

06025-70elieze.jpg	The Old Testament story of Eliezer and Rebecca was popular with both painters and printmakers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It was also frequently illustrated inn bibles.Salomon de Bray's painting shows Rebecca offering Eliezer a drink of water from a large pitcher much like a seventeenth-century Rhineland jar. Rebecca stands before the well near a crumbling wall, which is decorated with a classical relief of a sacrificial scene. A boy walking away from the well glances back at Rebecca and Eliezer; he carries a bucket and a jar spilling its content. On the right are the camels Eliezer brought on his journey. Beside them are three servants, one of the empties a sack of fodder into a trough. On the left women carrying pitchers in their hands and balancing them on their shoulders make their way up the slope.The picture is related to two, precisely dated preparatory drawings from November 1659

03539-blindsin.jpg	"The blind man is sitting on a grassy knoll in a once smart but now ragged suit of brightest blue with a yellowish-brown cloak draped over his shoulders and the hurdy-gurdy on his lap. A little further down the slope, dressed in rags of grey, stands his young companion, playing on the castanets; a dog, prancing on its hind legs, is looking up at him. Bayeu shows a scene of beggars in a genre of poverty that has a long tradition in Spain. Yet this painting shows poverty and humility only in its objects.The composition itself is diametrically opposed to the content: the bright blue of the clothing corresponds with the bright blue of the sky. The face of the singer - the face of a martyr and a poet - is solemnly illuminated by a warm glow and the contours of his figure are sharply and clearly outlined against the background. The vibrant green of the grass, the royal blue of the clothing, the flash of a brilliant red waistcoat all combine to create a magnificently elegant sense of harmony. Because the colour of the sky is linked with that of the beggar's costume, it elevates his figure to the level of great and memorable. The handling of colour, the clarity of composition turn the figure of the blind singer into a monument. The Neoclassicist stylistic techniques present their power to monumentalise a ""lowly"" scene"

31277-mystical.jpg	This altarpiece shows Piero at his most impressive as a mature painter of monumental religious subjects, crucially in the period before Leonardo's return to Florence from Milan. Supplied for the Pugliese altar in the church of the foundling hospital near SS. Annunziata, it features the Virgin and Child enthroned with Saints Dorothy, Peter (at left), Catherine and John the Evangelist (at right). It was installed in 1493.The painting is carefully structured in its layout and is compact with short, stocky bodies and overlapping forms. The work is basically symmetrical and controlled, but in an attempt to enliven the iconic altarpiece the image is predicated on the narrative of a double mystic marriage between Christ Child and St Catherine, who receives a ring, and St Dorothy, from whom he appears to take rosebuds. Piero's figures are seen close up giving them a force and monumentality

09618-ganymede.jpg	Two vertical canvases depicting Io and Ganymede, datable to 1531-32, are now in Vienna. These were made for Federico Gonzaga, first duke of Mantua. The duke intended to line a room in his palace with the Loves of Jupiter. Jupiter was a mythical ancestor of the Gonzaga family and, in his amorous exploits, not unlike Federigo.The Abduction of Ganymede, who is carried off by Zeus in the form of an eagle, has been seen as an allegorical interpretation that prefigured, in its moralizing intent, St John the Evangelist which Correggio painted several times in the church of the same name, and as referring to the flight of the intellect, liberated from earthly desires, toward the heaven of contemplation.Ganymede, the son of Tros, who gave his name to Troy, or of Laomedon, the father of Priam, was the most beautiful of mortal youths. Zeus chooses him as his cup-bearer and, covered with eagle feathers, takes him away from his earthly games and from his dog, that looks on in fear as the abduction takes place. The landscape beneath is of an almost eighteenth-century modernity, to the point where it resembles a transparent English watercolour

28917-gentlema.jpg	Moroni's style was already mature when he painted this splendid picture which summarizes his qualities as a portrait-painter. There is an intense truthfulness about the face of the sitter whose clothing and environment are littered with symbolic allusions. Moroni's sense of light and colour can neatly be linked to the Bergamo tradition established by Lorenzo Lotto but perhaps even more to the Brescia school.			
04863-3boilly.jpg	In the same Salon of 1808 hung two other pictures that seemed a universe away from Gros's epic conception but also alluded to the German campaign and its casualties. Louis-Leopold Boilly was known mainly as a painter of small, intimate narratives, humorous, sentimental and largely apolitical. As a young man he had painted a picture of a triumphant Marat but panicked that it would embroil him too far in revolutionary affairs; he had since steered clear of Napoleonic propaganda. When he returned to the realm of current affairs for his subjects, he did so from the perspective of ordinary people rather than Napoleon himself. The imperial armies had long been dependent on conscription, and as they were stretched further, there were many abuses, especially of the age limits. These, together with the recent carnage in Prussia, would have been much in the minds of those who stood before Boilly's Departure of the Conscripts in 1807. Most of the raggle-taggle procession who pass beneath the Porte St Denis in Paris have a jaunty air, but it strikes a false note; the men are undisciplined and shabby, and are given a bitterly ironic echo in the single figure on the extreme right of a blind man led by his dog.

15214-francis.jpg	"Considered a youthful work of Orazio Gentileschi by most of the critics, the canvas shows a well-known episode from Tommaso da Celano's account of the life of St Francis.The literature connects the canvas to Orazio's early Circumcision and sets it among a group of canvases executed before 1605. Moreover, this could be the project for which Gentileschi used a pair of false wings and a capuchin monk's habit that he borrowed from Caravaggio: the incident is recorded in the transcripts of a 1603 trial. Recent documentary discoveries about the patron who commissioned the work, on the other hand, suggest that the painting should be placed later in Gentileschi's career and dated to 1612-13. Such a dating would match the new chronology of the painter's works that has been reconstructed on the basis of recent archival research. The subject was evidently quite popular, and two other autograph versions of it by Gentileschi have been noted.Around the turn of the century, Gentileschi encountered Caravaggio in Rome: though he was almost forty years old and had been a successful painter for over twenty years, Orazio was deeply influenced by his encounter with the new style of the younger master. In contrast to other followers of Caravaggio, Gentileschi was not enslaved to the strong personality of the young Lombard and his extraordinary naturalistic novelties: rather, he selected the aspects of Caravaggio's art that stimulated him. He tended to prefer the clear and transparent light of Caravaggio's earliest works. As the Barberini Saint Francis demonstrates, he elaborated these immediately and without uncertainty, forming a striking synthesis that is based on his own depth of artistic experience. Gentileschi unites his Caravaggism with the influences of Santi di Tito and Commodi's reformist Florentine manner, as well as a particular chromatic sensitivity inherent to Tuscany: these elements are refined and Romanized through the artist's long experience working on papal projects.There is an inscription at the lower right, in gilded block letters, ""ORATE PRO R.D. HORATIO GRIFFIO/ HVIVS ORATORII ET CELLAE / FVNDATORE"""

Pantoja's early career is not well documented, but it is known that he was born in Valladolid in 1553 and studied with Sanchez Coello, whose path as a portraitist he scrupulously followed at the start of his career. However, in his later years, he enriched his style by absorbing new ideas from contemporary Flemish painters, including Rubens.

39576-11padua2.jpg	The Scuola del Santo in Padua, the house where the brotherhood of St Anthony met, was on the edge of the square in front of the church in which the famous Franciscan saint was buried. In 1510-11 Titian worked alongside other painters to decorate two walls in the upper assembly room (Sala Capitolare) with frescoes depicting miracles from the saint's life. He painted three scenes from the Life of St Anthony of Padua. They are the first of Titian's works that can be definitely dated and that still exist in their entirety.One of Titian's scenes depicts The Healing of the Wrathful Son. St Anthony reattached the foot of a young man who had cut it off in an outburst of violent temper because he had hurt his mother with it. Despite the difficulty of working on frescoes, which demanded great speed on the part of the artist, Titian succeeded in producing splendid landscapes

33011-12farnes.jpg	Raphael's pictorial narrative in the Loggia di Psiche begins in the spandrels of the short side on the left as one enters and continues along the spandrels to the right to the second short side and then along the entrance side. These triangular surfaces represented a problematic format for artists. Raphael solved this challenge in ever new and surprising ways, causing the form of the painting's support and the composition of its figures to interact in particularly fortuitous and varied manners.In this spandrel Cupid, who is already in love with Psyche, is pointing her out to the Graces. The figures are skillfully placed within the form of the spandrel such that they face in from all four sides and seem to push the space out with their backs and shoulders. This gives the group air and freedom in the centre without causing it to fall apart: the bodies interlock, overlap, and combine.It was said that only in the presence of the Three Graces could a young man recognize the charms of his beloved. Cupid is looking at the Graces and pointing with his left hand, not at Psyche, but at the loggia itself, the Chigis' own world. This is no doubt meant to refer to the lady of the house.

30099-esther.jpg	Esther, the beautiful Jewish wife of the Persian king Ahasuerus (Xerxes), and her cousin Mordecai persuaded the king to retract an order for the general annihilation of Jews throughout the empire (Esther 5: 1-2, 9-18). The massacre had been plotted by the king's chief minister, Haman, and the date decided by casting lots (purim). Instead, Haman was hanged on the gallows he built for Mordecai; and on the day planned for their annihilation, the Jews destroyed their enemies.This composition, influenced by Veronese, is a good example of Padovanino's art. His paintings are generally characterized by a decorative effect, clear compositions, and an abundance of beautifully rendered and narrative details. They are proof of his abandonment of Mannerism, which had become shallow, and his return to the artistic ideals of the High Renaissance

31513-stgeorg0.jpg	Pisanello was educated in Verona his first master was Stefano da Verona. He worked in Venice with Gentile da Fabriano on the frescoes of the Palazzo Ducale, then in the court of the Gonzaga princes in Mantua. He went to Rome with Gentile and worked on the frescoes of San Giovanni Laterano (destroyed). Returning to Verona he executed the frescoes of the Pellegrini Chapel in the church Santa Anastasia. Only the detail showing Saint George survived from these frescoes.Pisanello painted in his native Verona a depiction of a favourite subject of the period, St George, the Princess and the Dragon. It is a large fresco painted in the crown and spandrels of an arch.In the right spandrel the heroic St George prepares to intervene on behalf of the Princess. Pisanello placed the scene in Verona, showing the princess and the saint in the most elegant clothes of the day. In the background, men, presumably traitors, hang from the gallows. Like Uccello, Pisanello was also engaged by the new devotion to perspectival foreshortening, as is demonstrated by the horses, one seen from behind, and the other seen straight on

33459-22oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 526.The deep human suffering of the tyrant king was never expressed so well as in this work. Rembrandt, the greatest master of rendering the human soul in painting, filtered out of the twenty-five-hundred-year-old story what he had to say to his own seventeenth century Holland, while at the same time he fashioned a musical solution to spiritual suffering with the use of an eternal allegory of uplifting influence of artistic beauty.The life-size bust figures of Saul and David appear in a narrow opening against the dark background. With this composition the painter created the most intimate connection between the viewer and the figures in the painting. Within the picture, however, there are two strikingly different worlds. The broken old king, weighed down by his sufferings, turn inward in his lonely torment, no longer raving and ready to attack. His is a faraway look, and he limply holds onto the spear. With his left hand he wearily draws the blue velvet curtain to hide his sadness dissolving into tears. The fragile figure of the young David playing the harp is outside the dark circle of this misery. The light bouncing off his white collar and cuffs emphasizes his head, gently bent over his instrument and his finely formed hands. He is totally involved with his music, which connects the two and unifies them in this, the purest moment of catharsis.In 1969, the attribution of the painting to Rembrandt was rejected, but after a long period of study and treatment, the painting is once again considered to be an authentic Rembrandt.
