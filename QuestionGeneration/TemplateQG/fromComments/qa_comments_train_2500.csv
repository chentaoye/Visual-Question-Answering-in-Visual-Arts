09853-courb115.jpg	In 1858 Courbet stayed in Frankfurt where a studio was placed at his disposal in which young painters could watch him at work. Three major pictures date from his stay in  Frankfurt: The German Huntsman, The Hunters' Meal and the Woman of Frankfurt. The last of these constituted a new kind of painting for Courbet, a society portrait, staged with all the trappings this kind of commission required. It shows the wife of a Frankfurt notability in a sort of timeless state of incompletion relieved only by the features of the young woman savouring the late afternoon light from her terrace

37645-1paolo04.jpg	The picture shows the narrative scene on the north wall of the sacristy in San Paolo Maggiore, Naples.Thanks to their large format and their multitude of figures, the scenes on the end walls are largely responsible for the magnificent effect of the space. On the north wall the Conversion of St Paul is depicted, on the opposite south wall the Fall of Simon Magus can be seen. The two scenes depicting falls were juxtaposed with obviously didactic intent.In designing the Conversion of St Paul, Solimena was obliged to compete the monumental painting of Michelangelo, which was available in the seventeenth century in many reproductions. That his work survives comparison with this imposing precedent is not a result of borrowing from Michelangelo, but of his staging the scene in a way that could hardly be more dramatic, showing the tumultuous response of Saul's retinue to the fall and blinding of their leader

22299-allegor.jpg	This painting appears at first sight to be a triple portrait. The features are very natural, and the figures wear fashionable contemporary dress. But other elements make it likely that they were meant to be interpreted allegorically, and not as recognisable people. In particular, the prominent way in which roses are displayed on the ledge in the foreground and in the woman's belt clearly allude to the sweetness but transience of love. Nor can this be a simple scene of everyday music making, since the musical score is for an instrument, yet the figures represented are not instrumentalists. Instead, music is invoked as another poignant symbol of the transience of beauty and happiness

20043-05supper.jpg	Honthorst's genre pictures of light-hearted gatherings had a great impact in Utrecht. He made such pictures while he was still in Italy. His Supper Party, painted during his last months in Italy, set a precedent for similar scenes done in the 1620s at Utrecht where artists favoured the erotic as well as  the ascetic side of Baroque art. This is already evident in Honthorst's Supper Party where the person who covers the light has the effect of 'repoussoir': the large dark figure in the foreground causes, by contrast, the merrymakers behind him to recede in space, and thus enhances the illusion of depth. The second advantage is the vivid reflection of light thrown on the figures and, in particular, on their faces, which are painted in reddish-yellow colours. This helps Honthorst to overcome the harshness found in the work of other Caravaggio followers.

29277-210muril.jpg	In the final years of the 1660s Murillo increased his already considerable productivity. In 1667 he began to work for the Brotherhood of Charity, one of Seville's major lay confraternities. The Caridad, as it is known, was founded in 1565 with the mission of providing a decent burial for paupers. From 1663 the charitable activities were expanded to provide care for the needy sick, and a hospital was built, simultaneously enlarging and renovating the already existing chapel.The scheme for the decoration of the chapel is a tripartite exposition of Christian charity as the way of salvation. The first part comprises two memorable paintings by Vald�s Leal, demonstrating the futility of earthly pursuits and honours. A life devoted to accumulating wealth, power, and even learning is shown to lead only to the grave. Charity, which constitutes the second part of the program, provides the way to salvation, as seen in the seven acts of mercy, six of which are depicted by Murillo; the seventh, burying the dead, the Caridad's foundation charity, is embodied in a sculptural group, the Entombment of Christ by Pedro Rold�n, placed in the altarpiece. The third component consists of two paintings by Murillo for lateral altars, depicting St Elizabeth of Hungary and St John of God, both illustrating the efficacy of good works and the necessity of personal participation in charitable deeds.Murillo's paintings of the acts of mercy, which were installed on the walls of the chapel, have long been recognized as among his greatest. In order to impart maximum authority to the message, each of the acts is performed by Christ or a biblical character. In the Return of the Prodigal Son, which represents clothing of the naked, Murillo emphasizes the protective embrace of the forgiving father and underscores the good deed by showing a pile of fresh clothes held by a servant. The vaporous clouds that invade the background unobtrusively reinforce the warm sentiments of the joyful reunion

19398-crab.jpg	Around 1600 Dutch painting takes a decisive step, as still-life breaks away definitively from its context in history painting and develops into a complex genre of its own. Pieter Claesz had a great influence on still-life painting in Haarlem. The so-called 'breakfast' or 'banquet' pieces of the Haarlem school are characterised by their focus on a few objects representing a meal. This portrait of dumb, inanimate objects is asymmetrically arranged and its colour tends towards the monochrome. The foreshortening and overlapping of objects ties them into a subtle network of mutual relations. The tendency towards unity of atmosphere and colour that develops in the 1620s is manifested here in the generally grey-brown tone of the whole painting, which unites the individual objects into a whole, counterpointed by the local colour of the lemon and the little loaf of bread. Alongside these subtle nuances of colour is a play of light that both emphasises the modelling of the surfaces and introduces accents of light and shade

13457-goldfinc.jpg	In the early 1640s Fabritius had been the pupil of Rembrandt, and it must have been the master's chiaroscuro, employed as a subtle method of defining form through the inflection of light which impressed him most deeply. But while most other pupils of Rembrandt slavishly applied chiaroscuro, making it pretty and charming like Dou, Fabritius went in another direction altogether. Rembrandt's chiaroscuro was basically tonal, using intensities of light on a scale varying from very dark to very bright. The paintings of Fabritius, of which The Goldfinch is a brilliant example, maintain an overall brightness, a golden glow; yet within the strong light, light is still more inflected - not by toning it down or intensifying it but by tingeing it with subtle hues of colour. It was this method that Vermeer learned from Fabritius.It has been suggested that this painting, rather than fitting in a cabinet or interior window, may have served as a house sign for a family in The Hague whose name, De Putter, is Dutch for goldfinch. If it were placed in a plastered wall, the effect would have been strikingly illusionistic

06018-1jaeldeb.jpg	According to the Biblical story, the prophetess Deborah summoned the army captain Barak and ordered him in the name of God to take arms against Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite forces. Barak agreed to do so providing that Deborah accompanied him. She consented but warned Barak that the honour of the battle would not be his 'for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.'. Barak's troops won a resounding victory. Sisera himself fled to the tent of Heber, a member of the Kenite tribe with whom the Canaanites lived in place. Heber's wife Jael went out to welcome Sisera and after returning to the tent she covered him with a robe and gave him milk to drink. But as soon as the exhausted Sisera fell asleep, she took a hammer and drove a nail into his temple, pinning him to the ground. Shortly afterwards Barak arrived at the tent in pursuit of Sisera and saw that Jael had killed him. On that day, Deborah and Barak sang a song praising the virtues of Jael.In de Bray's painting Jael is not depicted in the act of killing Barak, she is seated holding the tent peg and hammer.

08866-13thomas.jpg	Even after Giorgione had introduced his revolutionary tonal reform, Giambattista Cima continued with his own lines of expression - his figures statue-like in their firmness and his colours richly limpid. These are the qualities we find in works of his that date from the first decade of the sixteenth century, works like the Incredulity of St Thomas and Bishop Magno for example, which was painted for the Guild headquarters of the Stone-masons at S. Samuele. Spaced with perfect harmony amid the sharp interplay of light and shade, the figures of Christ, of the Apostle and the saint stand statue-like and monumental against the perfectly matching marble slabs of a niche which seems to have been conjured into existence in the dreamy beauty of the countryside of the Veneto. Human figures, architecture and countryside all partake of the same sublime, formal heightening, images of an uncorrupted and incorruptible world, of a timeless, mythically serene present

25957-noahark2.jpg	With loving attention to faithful detail, Memberger's Noah cycle of five paintings gives a lively rendering of the most important events in the biblical story (Gen 6&#151;9): the building of the ark, the animals entering the ark, the flood, the animals leaving the ark and Noah's sacrifice of thanksgiving. All the paintings are dated and signed and bear the arms of both the Land Salzburg and of Wolf Dietrich. They are similar in their formal composition: against the partial view of a mountain landscape, the protagonists engage in their various activities in the foreground.The brilliant composition, minute execution and balanced use of colour prove the artist's Dutch-Italian training. He took over individual elements of the narrative from the depiction of the flood by Jacopo Bassano, without, however, copying the work of this eminent representative of late Renaissance painting in Venice. Memberger translated these elements into his own native idiom, differing from Bassano in his depiction of richly dressed people rather than humble beings, and his use of a visual vocabulary appropriate to the lofty tone of the court

This important phase in the development of Netherlandish landscape painting began circa 1626 and continued throughout the 1630s.The present painting, a typical early tonal work by Molyn, shows a dune landscape with travellers resting, extensive flatlands beyond

She was the woman who stood beside the road to Golgotha and wiped Christ's sweat-soaked, bloody face with a cloth. Christ's features were miraculously portrayed on the cloth. This vera icon on the sudarium was probably the origin of the saint's name.In a red garment covered with pearls and precious stones over which she wears a long dark blue mantle, and with a turban on her head as though she were a sibyl, Veronica stands in front of a golden background. She holds the enormous sudarium in front of her in both hands. Christ's head shows no trace of suffering but is conceived as a portrait of his true features, with the cross-shaped nimbus of his godliness. This transfer from the Man of Sorrows to the godly portrait on the sudarium is probably inspired by Memling. He twice portrayed the Veronica figure in this manner: on the outside of the Floreins triptych (Memlingmuseum, Bruges) and on the Bembo diptych (Munich-Washington). But for the type of the Christ figure the Ursula Master turned not to Memling but to Jan van Eyck.The Ursula Master painted an almost identical sudarium, though now carried by angels, in a painting in Venice (Pinacoteca Manfrediana). The standing figure of the saint and the undue magnification of the Veronica imprint, which no longer corresponds to the reality of the legend but which has grown into a monumental Christ emblem, originated beyond Memling in early fifteenth-century Cologne iconography. A very similar example is the pivotal work of the Master of St Veronica in Munich (Alte Pinakothek), formerly in St Severinus, Cologne. Here Christ is still shown as the suffering Son of Man with the crown of thorns on his head.Veronica stands on a floor. This must also originally have been the case in the panel of the Ursula Legend for the panel has been sawn off at the bottom. It was probably also straight at the top and not rounded off

28362-1basket.jpg	This painting is an early work by the young artist. She revealed at the age of 19 one of the very first signed and dated still-lifes known in France. The still-life genre had little regard in France, but became appreciated after the early 17th century and the reign of Louis XIII. The first known French works are dated from the 1620s and were popular among scholars who considered these paintings as worthy of display in cabinets of curiosities.The present still-life adapts the subject of a simple basket filled with damson plums arranged frontally on a table. The rigorous composition is pure and balanced. The composition is staged against a dark background highlighting the Caravaggesque theatrical effect. The table's edge is part of the composition. It is visible throughout the length of the panel and is described with great realism. The light projects from beyond the frame and from the left. It draws the shadow of the basket and accentuates the drama and realism.The painting is signed and dated lower right: Louyse Moillon / 1629

34692-portuens.jpg	This panel, called Portuense Altarpiece, was executed in 1480 for the church of S. Maria in Porto di Ravenna. The altarpiece was moved in the sixteenth century to the church of the same name that had been built outside the town. Following the suppression of the religious establishments and the requisition of church property in the Napoleonic period, the painting was consigned to the Accademia di Brera on April 26, 1811. Traditionally it was attributed to Stefano da Ferrara until the end of the 19th century.The saints around the Madonna are St Augustin, St Anne, St Elisabeth and Blessed Peter of Honesty (Piero degli Onesti) who was the founder of a local clerical chapter. On the base of the throne three monochrome reliefs can be seen.Ercole de' Roberti, who worked in the school of Cosm� Tura and Francesco del Cossa, was the last of that trio of painters who made the name of Ferrara famous. He took part in the great decorations commissioned by the ducal court and worked at Schifanoia and Belriguardo. In this altarpiece, which is the first documented work by Roberti, his style is independent, although it shows the influence of his Ferrarese antecedents. The altarpiece reveals a familiarity with Venetian art and the work of Giovanni Bellini and Antonello da Messina in particular. Under a beautifully constructed architectural canopy, the Virgin is seated on a throne; beside her, on the octagonal podium, stand St. Anna and St. Elizabeth. The space that opens up in the marble base of the throne allows a view of the landscape around Ravenna between the colonettes. The grisaille bas-reliefs represent The Massacre of the Innocents, The Adoration of the Magi and The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple; the triangular spaces above the arch show Samson with the Jawbone of an Ass and David with the Head of Goliath. The candelabra on the pilasters and the grisaille reliefs on the back of the throne and along the base show the Ferrarese taste for rigid, timeless form and for almost grotesque rock-like figures

35605-07landsc.jpg	On the edge of a wood, through which flows a stream, stands a herd of cattle. The last rays of the evening sun are shining through the trees, bathing the landscape in warm light. As maids from the nearby farm milk the cows, a wildfowler fires at a duck. The great variety of tree-trunks and foliage, of plants and animals, typifies that natural scheme of things in which air and water, light and warmth, sunshine and rain are provided in accordance with God's plan. That a peaceful life and the threat of death are never far apart is demonstrated by the disturbing proximity of the fowler with his gun to the women at work.Of the large and varied number of pictures Rubens completed in his lifetime, relatively few were landscapes, and of these the Berlin painting is one of the few in large format; it has a close affinity with two others, one of which is in the Royal Collection in London, the other in the Munich Pinakothek. Several of the figures in all three pictures are alike, although they are disposed in different ways. This does not detract from the significance of each individual work, but it does throw an interesting light on the painter's methods of working and on his habit of referring back to earlier sketches and studies. To judge by its composition and style of painting, the Berlin picture was the last of the group and must have been painted around 1630. In designing the forest, Rubens broke away almost entirely from previous sketches and with surprising artistic licence developed a quite novel arrangement of light and shade. The steep angle of the sun's rays creates a remarkable feeling of space and atmosphere. The lively brushwork gives an impression of complete spontaneity on the part of the artist, who was in no way inhibited by having to make corrections and may even have allowed for an extension of the panel-format.This painting was in the Duc de Richelieu's collection in the seventeenth century, together with two other Rubens works now in the Berlin Gallery, Andromeda chained to the Rock and The Shipwreck of Aeneas. In a description of the collector's art-treasures by Roger de Piles, published in 1677, this landscape is entitled Les Vaches. The Duke, a great-nephew of the famous Cardinal of the same name, took the opportunity, while on Louis XIV's campaigns in the Netherlands, to buy important works by Rubens

18292-1007grec.jpg	El Greco would have been aware of the grand series of pairs of Saints painted by Navarrete for the chapels of the Church of the Escorial, the commission interrupted by the latter's death in 1579. From the time of the Burial of the Count of Orgaz, El Greco began to create his own images of the different Saints. Once a pattern was created, he kept closely to it.The pairing of Saints - the juxtaposition of two separate personalities, with their different spiritual significance - accentuates the individual characters. Saint Peter and Saint Paul, the two Saint Johns, were more obvious juxtapositions, but he also brought together such unlikely characters as in the present painting - the one, the somewhat austere Apostle and Martyr of the time of Christ; the other, the ecstatic and 'gentle' Saint of the Middle Ages. The landscape also is double. The Saint Francis derives from the figure on the left of the Burial of the Count of Orgaz, and has become more spiritualised; the Saint Andrew is the same type as that of the Talavera painting of 1591, and the gesture is a remarkable development of the similar gesture of the Saint Maurice, in the Escorial painting, and eventually, indeed, can be traced back to the early Healing of the Blind

07592-54andrew.jpg	St Andrew was patron saint of Constantinople. From that city his body had been snatched by crusaders and brought to Amalfi, just one bay south of Naples. The Count of Benevente, viceroy to Philip III, King of Spain, was charged by his royal master to renovate the crypt in the cathedral of Amalfi, where the saint is buried; and it must have been while he was so engaged that he asked Caravaggio to paint him the scene of the saint's death. The painting was in the viceroy's grandson's inventory in 1653, then disappeared for over two centuries till it was bought from a private Spanish collection.It was customary to show Andrew crucified on a cross formed by two diagonals. According to the The Golden Legend, Aegeas, the proconsul of Patras, had Andrew held on the cross by ropes rather than nails, to prolong his suffering. But Andrew took advantage of his slow death to preach from the cross for two days, till the people threatened violence unless he were taken down. By this time Andrew had preached enough and, to die quickly, prayed that his limbs would be paralysed so that he could not be cut down. As a great light shines, he dies.It is this moment that Caravaggio paints. The old man looks weary from his agony, and the sturdy executioner who tries to undo the thongs is twisted round in a vain attempt to release him. Below a small group are transfixed by Andrew's eloquence: an old woman with a goitre (Andrew cured throat infections), a knight in black shining armour (the sceptical Aegeas), a middle-aged man and, behind the knight, a young bravo.

This portrait demonstrates the artist's mastery of the technique of painting in oils, which were much more flexible than tempera and allowed for far more precise tonal gradation. The play of light and shadow on the face models it and gives it volume, while light also creates the different textures of the clothes, skin and hair, etc. The sitter of this portrait was Tommaso Raimondi, a jurist and poet from Cremona.

24053-2sposi041.jpg	The narrative content of the Meeting anticipates the event depicted on the north wall, for here the letter that Ludovico will later open is being delivered. In this scene Mantegna combines portraiture, the almost archaeological reconstruction of an ancient city, and a highly-specified, convincing landscape.The scene is interpreted as the chance encounter between Ludovico Gonzaga and his son, Cardinal Francesco. The painting also can be seen as a presentation of three generations in the male line of the Gonzaga. The cluster of sons and grandsons around the marchese, who is here portrayed a second time, illustrates an aspect of the dynasty of fundamental importance for its continued health. The line of succession is assured, with a division of power in each generation between those selected for secular career and those called to a life in the Church. The depiction of the marchese with his oldest son, Federico (his mirror image at the left side of the picture), as well as Federico's son Francesco (the boy to the left) clearly suggests the continuity of the dynastic line. By contrast, the powerful central figure of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga and the two boys he holds by the hand - Sigismondo and Ludovico Gonzaga, who would also later enter the Church - assure us that with the succession of clerical dignitaries it produces the family has an ongoing tie to the Curia and to the pope

32244-17golden.jpg	How Nicolas Poussin the son of a Norman farmer became Nicolas Poussin 'painter-philosopher' in Rome, with 'a mind...as it were naturalised in antiquity', is one of the great triumphs of pertinacity over circumstance. Few artists of his importance have had such inadequate training, or found their true vocation so late. His interest in art was aroused by a minor itinerant painter working in a local church in Les Andelys. In the same year, 1611/12, Poussin left home for Paris. After years of hardship, and two unsuccessful attempts to reach Rome, he attracted favourable attention in 1622 with six paintings for the Jesuits. In 1624 he finally settled in Rome, firmly intent on emulating Raphael and ancient sculpture.Poussin's early period in Italy was barely easier than his years in Paris. As well as Raphael, engravings, statuary and a famous ancient wall-painting then in a princely collection, he studied Domenichino and Guido Reni and discovered Titian, whose Bacchus and Ariadne among other mythological scenes had just been brought to Rome from Ferrara. Not until he was about 35 did Poussin find his own voice, and patrons to heed it. From about 1630, with the exception of an unhappy interlude in Paris working for the king in 1640-2, he mainly painted smallish canvases for private collectors. Out of his very limitations, he created a new kind of art: the domestic 'history painting' with full-length but small-scale figures, for the edification and delight of the few. Seldom has a painter been more intense, more serious and, in the event, more influential.The Adoration of the Golden Calf was originally paired with the Crossing of the Red Sea now in Melbourne. Both illustrate episodes from Exodus in the Old Testament; this painting relates to chapter 32. In the wilderness of Sinai the children of Israel, disheartened by Moses' long absence, asked Aaron to make them gods to lead them. Having collected all their gold earrings, Aaron melted them down into the shape of a calf, which they worshipped. In the background on the left Moses and Joshua come down from Mount Sinai with the tablets of the Ten Commandments. Hearing singing and seeing 'the calf and the dancing...Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.' The tall bearded figure in white is Aaron still 'making proclamation' of a feast to the false god.Poussin is said to have made little figures of clay to use as models, and the story is confirmed by the dancers in the foreground. They are a mirror image of a pagan group of nymphs and satyrs carousing in Poussin's earlier Bacchanalian Revel also in the National Gallery. Within a majestic landscape painted in the bold colours Poussin learned from Titian, before a huge golden idol more bull than calf (and many earrings' worth), these Israelite revellers give homage to the potency of Poussin's vision of antiquity. As on a sculpted relief or painted Greek vase, figures are shown in suspended animation, heightened gestures or movements isolated from those of their neighbours, so that the effect of the whole is at one and the same time violent and static

24660-becket1.jpg	The picture shows a panel of the St Thomas Altarpiece.The Virgin is seated majestically enthroned on the red coverlet, which stretches over the end of the poor shed, and her head is surrounded with a huge halo. Jesus extends His hand towards the gift of one of the old Magi who kneels reverentially before Him, but Joseph, sitting on a low stool, takes the precious treasures from the Infant. Looking at the star that has led them, the other two Magi seem to agree that they have arrived at the right place.The space of the representation is filled up by the six figures, or it is rather their massive outlines, which sometimes stand in front of each other as well as their movements that determine the space. The surroundings are just indicated: instead of allowing a view of the scenery, the mountain on the right closes the background from our sight. In terms of composition this is meant to balance the shape of the roof on the left. Thus it is the arrangement, position and movements of the six figures that give life to this carefully balanced composition. The painter stressed all the symmetrical axes of the picture, which is nearly square. The central vertical axis divides the field of the picture into two halves. The three figures of the Holy Family on the left and of the three Magi on the right are arranged in pairs by means of parallels. That is how the old King and Jesus turning towards each other correspond, as do the figures of the Virgin and of the motionless King in the centre and, finally, of Joseph and the youngest King, both of them moving, figures of whom only their half covered profiles and backs are to be seen. But, in addition to the vertical axis, the diagonal lines are also emphasized (see the lines of Joseph's leg and his right arm, the heads of the Infant and of the King in the middle, and those of the Virgin and of the kneeling King respectively). By this the composition is divided into four quarters, the painter having particularly stressed the top and bottom triangles: the former by the direct link between Joseph, Jesus and the old King and the latter by the decorative area of the red background. The regular design of the sky like a wallpaper, and the hill shaped like softly folded drapery, together with the gently gathered fabrics of the garments, which hang in parallel folds, all mark this composition as belonging to the International Gothic style. The various shapes are merged into one another in unbroken curves: let us regard, for example, Joseph's right hand: his thumb is completely included in the tapering part of the reverse side of the Virgin's cloak, while his forefinger clings close to the Child's leg. The lines which sharply intersect with each other, such as the forefinger of the King in the centre, pointing to the star, are highly expressive

24591-st_anne1.jpg	Quentin Massys, born in Leuven, was received as a free master in the Guild of St Luke at Antwerp in 1491, where he became very well-known as a painter of religious subjects, portraits and satirical scenes, as well as embodying the new spirit of the Flemish Renaissance. The altarpiece in the Brussels museum is signed, dated and authenticated by archival documents. It was commissioned in 1507 by the Confraternity of St Anne in Leuven for its chapel in the church of St Peter in the same city and completed in 1509. It is a work of the painter's mature period, as shown by the Italianate architecture, the suavity of the faces and the pastel colours of the garments.The altarpiece contains five scenes from the life of St Anne, the Virgin's mother, and of her husband Joachim. The saint's family is represented on the central panel. Anne and the Virgin holding the Child are seated on a bench, dominating the composition. Anne's second daughter, Mary Cleophas, is seated at the Virgin's feet with James the Less, Simon, Thaddeus and Joseph, seen in church tradition as being her sons. A manuscript book, upside down on Joseph's legs, carries an illumination representing King David, an allusion to Christ's ancestors. Anne's third daughter, Mary Salome, is seated at her mother's feet with her two sons, James the Great and John the Evangelist, the latter identified by the inkwell attached to his waist. The four men behind the balustrade are Joachim and his sons-in-law Joseph, Alpheus and Zebedee.The significant episodes of Anne's and Joachim's lives are evoked on the wings of the triptych. The narrative cycle that starts on the reverse of the wings depicts essentially the drama of the couple's sterility and Anne's late maternity. To the left is depicted the gift made by the young couple to the temple for the poor. On the right panel, the high priest is refusing the aged Joachim's offering because he is childless. The passing of time between the two scenes is indicated by Joachim's beard and the change in the priest's appearance. The cycle continues on the front of the left panel where an angel announces Mary's birth to Joachim. In the background of the same panel, the conception of the Virgin takes place through the exchange of a chaste kiss between the spouses in front of the Golden Gate close to the city wall. The cycle ends with Anne's death, represented on the front of the right wing, surrounded by her children and with Christ blessing her.

40360-2hawkwoo.jpg	"In 1436 the administrators of the Opera del Duomo in Florence commissioned Paolo Uccello to paint a fresco in the Cathedral, a monument commemorating the English soldier of fortune Sir John Hawkwood (Giovanni Acuto for the Italian) who had died in 1394; Hawkwood had led the Florentine troops to victory in the battle of Cascina (1364). Still in the Cathedral today, the fresco was restored in 1524 by Lorenzo di Credi, who added the elegant frame with the grotesque pattern decorations.The fresco is a splendid example of how Uccello used the new means of expression (perspective and sculptural quality) in a totally personal way; adding to them the monochrome effect of ""terra verde"", the painter has succeeded in creating the illusion of a statue, standing on a plinth. The base is shown in foreshortening, so as to be seen correctly from below, whereas the warrior in on his horse is drawn in full frontal perspective. This seemingly contradictory use of the rules of perspective, which has given rise to innumerable debates, is further evidence of the originality of Uccello's language. The unnatural movement of the horse, which is raising both its right legs at the same time, was pointed out as a serious mistake by Vasari, but it is justified by the consistency of Paolo's perspective construction.In the Monument to Sir John Hawkwood there are also some elements derived from Masaccio's painting, like the trompe 1'oeil perspective of the base, very similar to the base below Masaccio's Trinity, and the sculptural relief of the horse and the rider created with a strong chiaroscuro. And furthermore, as in all Masaccio's works, the light comes from the left and is very natural. But there are just as many elements that clearly distinguish Paolo's art from Masaccio's: Uccello's realism is much more analytic than synthetic, in other words it is more similar to the late Gothic style than to Masaccio's. Uccello's analytic realism blends extremely well with his geometrization of forms, which contributes to the overall effect of abstractism conveyed by his works. In other words Paolo's compositions are more abstract and symbolic than natural: this painting is more a portrayal of the idea of a warrior than of a warrior in flesh and blood.The administrators of the Opera del Duomo did not appreciate the fresco at all, and ordered Uccello to paint it again, which the artist did. We do not know exactly what Paolo changed, but he probably just toned down the colours, which were considered too bizarre"

12290-3ruccela.jpg	The picture's name derives from the Rucellai Chapel of Santa Maria Novella where it remained, after being moved to several different places inside the church, from 1591 to 1937, the year of the Giotto exhibition. It was then transferred to the Uffizi. The panel was commissioned in 1285.The painting has been the subject of much controversy among critics. In the fifteenth century it was thought to be the work of Cimabue, and this attribution, supported by Vasari, was accepted until the beginning of the twentieth century. The design of the frame decorated with roundels, the three pairs of angels flanking the throne and the sweeping gesture of the Child's blessing hand, show undeniable similarities to Cimabue's Maest&#224;, now in the Louvre but at that time in the Church of San Francesco in Pisa. This may have been the inspiration of Duccio; Giorgio Vasari, in his Lives (not always completely reliable), documents a not improbable sojourn in Pisa.The elements from Cimabue are enriched with delicate Gothic overtones, unknown at that time, but which were to become a permanent feature of Sienese art. The brilliance of colour, the curving outlines and the sinuous movement of the gilded edging of Mary's cloak are all new. The entire structure of the throne reflects the influence from beyond the Alps: the panels are slender mullioned windows, the foot-rest is supported by a light double arch, the back is crowned with delicate arching and little pinnacles.The iconographical interpretation is also new in that the angels holding up the throne no longer form the crowning part of a solemn and magnificent background but are all looking towards the Virgin in attitudes of intense emotional participation.The connection with the 1285 contract is borne out by the painted frame that fulfils a specific iconographical purpose in accordance with the intentions of the Confraternity of the Laudesi. This was founded within the Dominican order, around 1244-45, with the object of fighting heresy by means of an intensive preaching programme. In the medallion placed at the top is the image of Christ. On his left are twelve figures, mostly prophets and patriarchs, among whom are: John the Baptist immediately next to the Redeemer, King David crowned and with the psalms, the young Daniel holding a roll. On the right of the Virgin, the Apostles, to whom the Child is turning to give his blessing, represent the New Testament. Peter and John the Evangelist are the first of the saints, many of whom are complete with books and scrolls that refer to the Gospel and in a more general sense underline the importance of preaching.The roundels in the lower section, more easily visible to the faithful, contain images of the saints to whom the Laudesi and the Dominicans were particularly devoted. In the centre is St Augustine of Hippo, whose rule guided the Dominican friars. On the left are Catherine of Alexandria and Dominic. On the right is Zenobius, early medieval bishop and patron of the city, accompanied by Peter the Martyr, the then recently canonized founder of the Confraternity. The significance of the frame and the medallions is therefore not solely ornamental but conveys the commissioners' desire for self-proclamation: the Dominican brotherhood was to be visualized as a lay group championing the cult of the Virgin

18722-guard102.jpg	This view of the Lagoon was taken from the Fondamenta Nuove, where Francesco Guardi kept a studio for some time. From there, one could see on the left the island of San Cristoforo, like so many other islands in the Lagoon the site of a monastery. Diagonally behind San Cristoforo is the island of San Michele, the location of the oldest Renaissance church of Venice, designed in 1469 by Mauro Codussi. In the eighteenth century San Cristoforo and San Michele were two separate islands, but during the Napoleonic period they were connected in order to expand the cemetery of San Michele. At that time the monastic complex of San Cristoforo della Pace was demolished. Finally, behind San Michele lies the island of Murano with its famous glassworks.Artistic interest in the islands of the Lagoon first manifested itself in a series of prints by Antonio Visentini from 1738, which concentrate on the ecclesiastical buildings on these islands. In his paintings of the Lagoon, on the other hand, Guardi focused on the nearly motionless surface of the water and on the constant play of light and reflection so characteristic of the Venetian scene. In so doing he captured the unique atmosphere of the Lagoon in a manner comparable to no more than a few prints and drawings by Canaletto

14435-202fried.jpg	One of the leading artists of the German Romantic movement, born in the small Baltic seaport of Greifswald and trained at the Academy in Copenhagen, Friedrich specialised in landscape painting. His aim was not, as he wrote, 'the faithful representation of air, water, rocks and trees...but the reflection of [the artist's] soul and emotion in these objects'. Later, using landscape to convey subjective feelings, he also invested it with symbolism. Natural elements such as mountains, sea, trees, the seasons of the year and the times of day, often acquired religious significance.Winter Landscape was originally exhibited by Friedrich in 1811 in Weimar with another winter scene, now in the museum in Schwerin. In the bleak Schwerin picture, a tiny figure on crutches stares out across a snow-covered plain. He is surrounded by the gnarled trunks of dead or dying oaks, and stumps of felled trees stretch away into the distance. But the uncompromising desolation of this image is countered by its companion now in London. Here the same cripple has abandoned his crutches. He leans against a sturdy rock, raising his hands in prayer before a crucifix gleaming against the vigorous evergreen branches of young fir trees. On the horizon the facade and spires of a Gothic church, whose silhouette echoes that of the firs, rise like a vision out of a bank of mist. Shoots of grass push through the snow, and the sky is streaked with the glow of dawn. The mortal despair in the first painting is here transformed into the hope of resurrection, the salvation vouchsafed through Christ's sacrifice on the cross.Friedrich was not the only one of his countrymen in this period to draw an analogy between 'native German' Gothic church architecture and the natural growth of forest trees, and the imagery here almost certainly reflects his sympathies with the patriotic and democratic movements of the day as well as his religious faith.Winter Landscape was painted with surprisingly few pigments, suggesting that Friedrich was less interested in colour than in smoothly graduated tones. He achieved the striking effect of shimmering, transparent haze by careful stippling with the point of the brush, using a blue pigment - smalt - which is transparent in an oil medium.

42009-stprocess.jpg	The painting was commissioned for the St Peter's, and it was the only important commission of the whole career of Valentin. It is of interest because the artist modified his largely tenebrist style to suit the situation. The subject, a gruesome one, is of the Martyrdom of St Processus and St Martinian. It was subsequently replaced by a mosaic, the original being moved to the Pinacoteca Vaticana.A possible reason for the lightening of the artist's style is the fact that the picture had to match the already completed Martyrdom of St Erasmus by the young Nicolas Poussin, who had in turn modified his style towards a much more Caravaggesque approach, especially in his realistic treatment of the gruesome subject-matter. Neither painter received such a commission again, and these two altarpieces stand out in their respective careers, proving that young French artists did appeal to influential people - in this case officials of the Papacy - with the money to give commission. It could also be argued that this was because by the end of the 1620s pure Caravaggism as such was already out of fashion among all successful Italian painters working in Rome

37845-cabinet.jpg	"Art cabinets belong to the Flemish tradition of ""Kunstkamers"" (Cabinets of Curiosities) paintings. This genre appeared in Antwerp at the beginning of the 17th century and included paintings of interiors covered in works of art. In fact, it is relatively common to see these paintings portraying collections that actually existed. The artists also liked to depict fictitious cabinets, the fruit of their imagination, which could be based on portrayals of paintings, sculptures and exotic objects belonging to the various collections in Antwerp. These art cabinets were metaphors for know-how, taste and knowledge. The present painting belongs to this category.There are four other very similar versions of this emblematic work: one belongs to a private Italian collection, another is kept at the Prado in Madrid, a third one, which involves a collaboration with Jan 'Velvet' Brueghel for the figures of Albert and Isabella, is in Baltimore, and the last one belongs to the royal collections of England"

04841-stillife.jpg	"A ""tiny banquet"" or ""small breakfast"" is best seen as the sober counterpart to the ostentatious Dutch 17th century still-lifes. The number of objects portrayed is limited, the colour palette muted: black, white, grey and brown in every shade define the atmosphere. Connoisseurs frequently deprecate Maerten Boelema de Stomme's often slightly out-of balance and over-busy compositions, with objects piled one on top of another. However, this painting is repeatedly cited as a time when Boelema de Stomme equals his teacher Heda.A round, voluminous object in the form of a bearded man's crock placed in a diagonal beam of light is chosen to form the centre of a composition which seeks to perform a dangerous balancing act, its excess weight having to be neutralised over the rest of the painting. A second eye-catching item, a precious nautilus beaker, is placed on the one visible corner of the table, reflecting the white of the table cloth and standing out starkly against the dark, neutral background of the upper right-hand corner. The oval and circular shapes of the plates with simple foodstuffs echo and inter-link the shapes of the main objects. A fluted glass, flanked to the right by a step glass, provide the top of a triangle in the composition. The salt cellar and an overturned berkemeier wineglass fill the lower left corner of the tableau.A second connecting line runs between three objects: a knife with a blocked handle, to the left on a plate, refers to its dark black knife-case, the down-hanging top of which counterbalances the upward movement of the fluted glass. Only an opened walnut and hazelnut, close to the pealed lemon, suggest that the laid table has already been touched. The nuts strewn between the other objects produce a concentration of smaller ovals that attract the viewer's eyes as to the centre of a whirlpool: the nuts themselves, the opening of the crock, its cover, the surface of the cut-open fruit, the wire foot and the thorn knobs on the wineglass, the ball-feet of the salt cellar.The artist sparingly distributes a few yellow colour accents over the picture surface in the lemons and the bread roll. A blue-green touch is visible solely in the mother-of pearl sheen of the nautilus shell cup: the rarer something is, the greater its value."

07890-crucifix.jpg	Giulio Carpioni was initially a pupil of Alessandro Varotari, known as 'Il Padovanino', who, in the early years of the seventeenth century, had reacted to the mortifying conformism of the late Mannerists by returning to the classicism of the young Titian for his inspiration. Carpioni subsequently refined the intentions of his master still further in a sort of ideal classic style through the polished sharpness of his line and the cold, brilliant range of colours he used. In his Crucifixion the devotional aims are conveyed through an atmosphere of abstract, formal severity.

26684-10_4pe41.jpg	The scenes painted in the pendentives at the sides of prophet Jonah are characterized by the use of pronounced foreshortening. This is the case with the tangled group of Israelites who, in the scene of the Brazen Serpent, writhe in the throes of death, and, above all, with the crucified figure of Haman in the Punishment of Haman.In the Brazen Serpent, the mass of bodies poisoned by the snakes occupies the whole of the right part, spreading toward the center. The survivors are grouped on the left, eyes and arms turned imploringly toward the salvafic image of the brazen serpent. The cruel punishment of the Israelites for having spoken against God and Moses occupies a large part of the pendentive, with bodies intertwined in an indescribable tangle. This presented the artist with an opportunity for virtuosic foreshortening and twisting of the bodies, and also depicting contorted, screaming faces. Much admired by Vasari, the group is a striking forerunner of the spectacular motifs that were, in the following decades, typical of the current of Mannerism comprising Giulio Romano and Vasari himself.The Biblical story (Num. 21 :4-9)The Israelites, discontented with life in the desert, spoke out against God and Moses. They were punished with a plague of poisonous snakes which only increased their hardships. Many died of snakebite. When the people repented, Moses sought God's advice how they should be rid of the snakes. He was told to make an image of one and set it on a pole. Whoever was bitten would be cured when he looked upon the image. Moses accordingly made a serpent of brass on a tau-shaped (T) pole, which proved to have a miraculous curative effect.Representation in ArtThe Israelites are depicted writhing on the ground, their limbs entwined by snakes. Moses, sometimes with Aaron, stands beside the brazen serpent. John's gospel furnishes the typological parallel: 'This Son of Man must be lifted up as the serpent was lifted up by Moses in the wilderness.' Medieval art juxtaposed the subject with the serpent in the Garden of Eden entwining the Tree of Knowledge. Both probably derive from an ancient and widespread fertility image, the 'asherah', associated with the worship of Astarte, which consisted of a snake and a tree representing respectively the male and female elements. King Hezekiah destroyed the asherah, by inference the one made by Moses, at a time when the Israelites were relapsing into idolatry (II Kings 18:4).The presence and the identification of Moses in Michelangelo's fresco is debated

23542-4zrinyi.jpg	"Madar�sz took all the subject matter for his historical works from the heroic past of Hungary. When ""Zr�nyi and Frangep�n in B�cs�jhely Prison"" was exhibited in Hungary in 1866, people ""went on pilgrimages"" to see it. It shows P�ter Zr�nyi, the Ban of Croatia, and Ferenc Frangep�n, both of whom had taken part in the Wessel�nyi Conspiracy against the Habsburg rule in an attempt to restore the constitutional rights of the Hungarians. The two patriots who rebelled against the Emperor say farewell to each other in B�cs�jhely Prison before their execution. Th�ophile Gautier remarked that ""their manly faces show the pain they feel about the uselessness of their sacrifice, rather than sorrow for their own lives. They would gladly die if they could but restore the rights to the country"". The group of haughty imperial followers in the background emphasizes the intimacy of the two main figures. Among them is Prince Lobkowitz, a confidant to the Emperor, wearing black robes and a wig. The compositional merits of the painting and the excellent characterization are accompanied by great technical ability - the local colours of this lavishly painted work are augmented by fine translucent shadows and reflections"

44077-02lady.jpg	Leaving aside the portraits of the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy (Philip the Good and Isabella of Portugal), which have been preserved only in copies (by anonymous masters, now in Berlin and Malibu), the only extant panel portrait from the period before about 1450 is the Portrait of a Young Woman. The young woman, with her expansive Flemish winged or horned coif of fine linen, through which the forehead remains visible, fills almost the entire panel. The 'nakedness' of the face and the softness of the features form an attractive contrast to the firm outlines of the stiffly folded linen and the dark background. The sitter's hands with beringed fingers are laid firmly on one another and rest on an invisible sill, support being provided visually by the frame.While in his twenties the artist married Elisabeth Goffaerts, a native of Brussels, and it has been generally assumed that she is the subject of the Berlin portrait. Although there is no real foundation for it, this is not an unreasonable assumption; the open, warmhearted expression seems to preclude an official portrait and to suggest someone close to the artist.It was undoubtedly this impression of intimacy created in this portrait - it occurs nowhere else in the painter's work - which seemed to call for some explanation. To portray the subject looking directly at the viewer was something quite new when this painting was executed; in the Netherlands this technique occurs for the first time in van Eyck's portraits. The resemblance to the portrait of a woman by the Master of Fl�malle (now in the National Gallery, London) is worth noting. The artist has modelled his subject with sympathy and sensitivity, while avoiding contact with the observer

33663-10misc.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 310.Rembrandt's long-standing interest in the peoples and costumes of the Near East was extended in the 1650s to embrace the still more exotic regions of Asia and North Africa. His inventory of 1656 contained a reference to a set of Indian Mogul miniatures, now thought to be those which were later taken to Austria and incorporated in the decoration of the Sch�nbrunn Palace outside Vienna. Rembrandt made about thirty pen-and-wash copies of these miniatures and, while his exact purpose in doing this is unknown, the fact that they are so numerous suggests that he wanted the copies for reference rather than that he was simply practicing. Although the direct influence of these miniatures on his work was very slight, they represented to some extent a parallel approach to his own style in the 1660s.Something of this can be seen in the angular shapes, flattened forms and seemingly casual composition of the Two Africans. Hitherto, Africans had appeared in European art almost exclusively in the scene of the Adoration of the Kings, one of the kings traditionally being black, but a few other portraits of Africans, including two oil sketches by Van Dyck, are known from the seventeenth century. Rembrandt's painting, however, is the most penetrating and realistic. He succeeded in rendering the African physiognomy with perfect sympathy and fidelity

12116-mme_pomp.jpg	The son of a painter, Hubert Drouais, Fran�ois-Hubert became a successful portraitist at the French court. He was especially fashionable for his likenesses of aristocratic children dressed as gardeners or Savoyard beggars to emphasise their 'natural' or 'filial' characters (little Savoyard hurdy-gurdy players brought their earnings back every year to their mothers in the Haute Savoie). This sumptuous portrait of Madame de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, similarly employs the imagery of bourgeois virtue and industry to flatter a great lady.In this case, however, the fiction is less pronounced: the Marquise de Pompadour had been born plain Mademoiselle Poisson. Pretty, charming, good-natured and well-educated, at the age of nine she had been told by a fortune-teller that she would reign over the heart of a king - after which her family called her Reinette, 'little Queen' (twenty years later she was to reward the woman with the gift of an enormous sum, six hundred livres). Married to the nephew of her mother's rich lover, she began to entertain Parisian intellectuals at her salon; Voltaire is the best-known of the 'philosophes' whom she captivated and supported. She soon attracted the eye of the king, Louis XV, and by 1745, separated from her husband, she was installed at Versailles and ennobled. To her enemies she remained always a Parisian bourgeoise, member of a class which was enriching itself, as they saw it, at their expense. She kept the friendship and interest of the king, however, even after their sexual relationship had ended in 1751-2, by her affection, her charm, and above all through her interest in music and the arts.Drouais's painting faithfully records her pursuits, surrounding her with books, a mandolin, an artist's folio, her beloved pet dog, and dressing her in a lavishly embroidered silk dress edged with yards of superb lace. Her embroidery - more accurately, tambouring - wools are kept in an elaborate work-table in the latest fashion, with S�vres plaques (Madame de Pompadour had earlier taken the porcelain factory of Vincennes under her protection and transferred it to S�vres, near one of her houses). She looks up at the viewer as she might have done at the king when he came into her apartment through their private staircase; a woman no longer young, yet still with that 'wonderful complexion' and 'those eyes not so very big, but the brightest, wittiest and most sparkling', as praised by a contemporary. Yet there is more here than we can see at first sight. As his signature tells us, Drouais painted the Marquise's face from the life in April 1763 on a separate rectangle which was then joined to the rest of the canvas. She must have approved of the likeness for other, half-length portraits were commissioned from Drouais. But this picture was finished in May 1764, some weeks after her death on 5 April at the age of 43. All her life she had suffered from ill-health, and even in her last illness stoically wore rouge and smiled at everybody. Drouais's suave and grand yet somehow intimate portrait installs her in our memory as she would have wished to be remembered.

13402-15arno.jpg	"""The Arnolfini Marriage"" is a name that has been given to this untitled double portrait by Jan van Eyck, now in the National Gallery, London. It is one of the greatest celebrations of human mutuality. Like Rembrandt's ""Jewish Bride"", this painting reveals to us the inner meaning of a true marriage. Giovanni Arnolfini, a prosperous Italian banker who had settled in Bruges, and his wife Giovanna Cenami, stand side by side in the bridal chamber, facing towards the viewer. The husband is holding out his wife's hand.Despite the restricted space, the painter has contrived to surround them with a host of symbols. To the left, the oranges placed on the low table and the windowsill are a reminder of an original innocence, of an age before sin. Unless, that is, they are not in fact oranges but apples (it is difficult to be certain), in which case they would represent the temptation of knowledge and the Fall. Above the couple's heads, the candle that has been left burning in broad daylight on one of the branches of an ornate copper chandelier can be interpreted as the nuptial flame, or as the eye of God. The small dog in the foreground is an emblem of fidelity and love. Meanwhile, the marriage bed with its bright red curtains evokes the physical act of love which, according to Christian doctrine, is an essential part of the perfect union of man and wife.Although all these different elements are highly charged with meaning, they are of secondary importance compared to the mirror, the focal point of the whole composition. It has often been noted that two tiny figures can be seen reflected in it, their image captured as they cross the threshold of the room. They are the painter himself and a young man, doubtless arriving to act as witnesses to the marriage. The essential point, however, is the fact that the convex mirror is able to absorb and reflect in a single image both the floor and the ceiling of the room, as well as the sky and the garden outside, both of which are otherwise barely visible through the side window. The mirror thus acts as a sort of hole in the texture of space. It sucks the entire visual world into itself, transforming it into a representation.The cubic space in which the Arnolfinis stand is itself a prefiguration of the techniques of perspective which were still to come. Van Eyck practised perspective on a purely heuristic basis, unaware of the laws by which it was governed. In this picture, he uses the mirror precisely in order to explode the limits of the space to which his technique gives him access as soon as it threatens to limit him"

23386-08virgin.jpg	The painting is a version of a well-known composition: the Virgin and Child enthroned on a background of rich green drapery being crowned by two angels. In the left foreground, St James holds a stick, the classical sign of the pilgrim, with his knapsack next to him, while St Andrew on the right leans on the cross of martyrdom. Beside them and further back are two medical saints, Cosma and Damian, one of whom is holding a spatula and the other a pharmaceutical jar. The presence of these is due to the dedication of the altar, but there may also have been a personal meaning for Lotto. He was recovering from an illness between August and December 1546 when working on the altarpiece. Signs of this may perhaps also be found in the painting itself, with its simplification and poverty of inspiration, favouring the mystical moment typical of popular piety. The warm, luminous colouring, even if in subdued tones, has been recently brought back to light thanks to a masterful restoration

19891-91gentle.jpg	The painting's similarities with other works dating from the early 1530s have led to the supposition that the sitter was a leading musician at Henry VIII's court. The king was a keen musician and amateur composer and rewarded such figures well; to be afforded the distinction of a Holbein portrait could be seen as an official seal of approval. The sitter's employment demonstrates the range of clientele to whom Holbein now catered.Time has not been kind to this work, however, much of whose detail has been destroyed by overzealous cleaning. The green background is that of the underpainting - hence its unusually harsh tone - and definition on the lute is vague. It is to be expected that writing was originally visible on the score, which may have given the identity of the sitter (once thought to be Jean de Dinteville).The structure and pose show Holbein's knowledge of current Venetian compositional formations (as exemplified in the work of Titian and Lotto).

33585-127portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 255.This life-size equestrian portrait of Frederik Rihel (1621-1681), an Amsterdam Lutheran merchant, is exceptional in Rembrandt's oeuvre. (it is one of only two known Dutch painting of the kind.) The horse and rider in the painting are executing a levade, an exceedingly difficult movement. Paintings of this type would normally have depicted only royalty or high nobility. The great prototype was Titian's portrait of Charles V on horseback in the Prado, which inspired Vel�zquez, Rubens and van Dyck in paintings of Spanish and English kings. The ability to perform a levade not only displayed mastery over the horse, it was also symbolic of the ability to rule.Rihel was a native of Strasbourg who came to Amsterdam as a boy to work in the famous Bartolotti banking house. By the time he was thirty he had advanced to a responsible post in the firm, and after the death of Guillelmo Bartolotti in 1658 he took over the reins on behalf of the widow

40342-2green.jpg	"Below the Creation of the Animals and the Creation of Adam, we can see the Creation of Eve and Original Sin. Painted in ""terra verde"" (a special kind of pigment made of iron oxide and silicic acid), which gives the cloister its name, these frescoes introduce us to some of the main features of Uccello's style: the predominant influence of Ghiberti, visible primarily in the austere figure of God the Father, so like the characters on the Doors of Paradise in the Baptistry in Florence, blends here with details that come straight out of Masaccio's painting, such as the drawing of Adam's naked body, or of Masolino's, such as the serpent's head in the scene of Original Sin.The overall construction of the scenes is designed according to very precise geometric plans, so that the outlines at times coincide with the perfect shapes of circles. Blended with this geometric aspect we find elements that belong to the late Gothic, such as the careful description of naturalistic details: the sharp-edged rocks of the desert landscape in the Creation, or the trees laden with fruit and leaves in the Original Sin"

18471-gougenot.jpg	"It is probably shortly after their marriage on 14 March 1757 that Greuze painted the portraits of George Gougenot de Croissy and his wife, Marie-Ang�lique de Varenne, the daughter of the King's equerry and counsellor-secretary. Both paintings remained together until 1937, when they were bought by two separate collectors at an auction in Paris. In 1951 the portrait of George Gougenot found its way into the Brussels museum, and that of his wife 25 years later into the New Orleans Museum of Art.George Gougenot was the younger brother of Abb� Louis Gougenot, Greuze's friend and protector. He started his career in the navy, and followed his father as the King's counsellor-secretary. Gougenot was not only an art connoisseur, patron and an erudite man, but also showed interest in more general topics, publishing anonymously a study entitled Etat pr�sent de la Pensylvanie (1756). In the portrait Gougenot wears a grey velvet costume, decorated with superbly reproduced cuffs and a jabot in ""point d'argentan"". His hand lies on the Spectator, an English journal, founded in London in 1711 to raise moral standards. The subtle grey gradations accentuate the penetrating look and the intelligent face, with the somewhat disdainful line around the mouth. The powdered wig, the refined representation of the fabric, and the vague, neutral background, produce an atmosphere of distinction and courtliness.In his anecdotal compositions, Greuze exhibits his preference for moralising scenes. Unlike certain contemporaries, among them Hubert Robert, with their love of antiques, Greuze instead prefers to seek his inspiration from rustics and sentimental bourgeois life. Alongside his often grandiloquent representations, Greuze also executed a number of elegant but also psychological portraits, such as the canvas discussed here, a typical example from the Rococo period. Although Greuze is not a born colourist, as are his French contemporaries Jean Antoine Watteau or Jean-Honor� Fragonard, he succeeds in imparting a warmth to this portrait by means of harmonic light gradations. The particular sensitivity with which it is painted can perhaps be explained by the painter's friendship for his noble model"

06613-bouquet.jpg	This painting was commissioned by Cardinal Federico Borromeo; it served him as an object of meditation.To paint flowers means to enter into competition with Nature, in a sphere in which she herself is an artist. With brushes and paints, the artist creates a living spring full of unfading blooms that will neither wilt in the heat of summer nor perish beneath the winter's snow. In reality it would be impossible to arrange a bouquet such as that presented here, not simply because it combines flowers that bloom at different times, but also because it would collapse.In this painting, the smaller flowers are painted at the bottom and the larger and heavier ones at the top - a device that serves to guide the eye through this cabinet-piece of fine painting. Unlike their leaves and stems, the blooms - of which there are a good hundred varieties - are all evenly lit; they are arranged in one plane and only rarely overlap.Amongst the insects attracted to the bouquet are butterflies. Painters of butterflies take up an illustrious tradition that can be traced right back to Zeus, the father of the gods, who also practiced this skilful art - as Dosso Dossi shows him doing in the painting Jupiter and Mercury of c. 1530 (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum). In Christian tradition the butterfly is an allegory of human existence and the cycle of life in a physical body, death and the resurrection of the soul. A bee has also strayed into the picture, as an indication of the care with which the painter has selected, from amongst the countless varieties of flowers, only the most magnificent blooms for his bouquet

12312-6perugia.jpg	"The Perugia Madonna, now in the local National Gallery, was kept perhaps ab antiquo up until 1863 in the monastery of San Domenico in Perugia, hung above the sacristy door or in the ""Winter Choir"". It was ascribed to Duccio in 1911 and subsequent restoration revealed it to be the central panel of a dismantled polyptych.The formal stylistic elements of the traditional half-length portrait of the Madonna and Child develop into the portrayal of a solid mother and son relationship, showing a greater naturalness of gesture. Remarkable spontaneity is shown in the movement of the Child who is sitting on his mother's curved arm, clutching the soft folds of her veil. This detail in dress is of importance since it takes the place of the red Byzantine maph�rion, evidently considered old-fashioned by the painter. The Virgin's gesture, showing the Child's hand and pointing to his feet, is also significant: it seems to allude to the future Passion of Christ.The original splendour of the painting is marred by its poor state of preservation, but although of high pictorial value it had no influence on local artistic production"

34150-cockburn.jpg	In his seventh Discourse on Art delivered at the Royal Academy in 1776, Reynolds proclaimed:He...who in his practice of portrait-painting wishes to dignify his subject, which we will suppose to be a lady, will not paint her in the modern dress, the familiarity of which alone is sufficient to destroy all dignity... [he] dresses his figure something with the general air of the antique for the sake of dignity, and preserves something of the modern for the sake of likeness.In his fourth Discourse of 1771 he had recommended the 'historical Painter' never to to 'debase his conceptions with minute attention to the discriminations of Drapery...With him, the clothing is neither woolen, nor linen, nor silk, satin, or velvet: it is drapery; it is nothing more.'Reynolds was not alone in worrying about the way portraits began to look ridiculous as fashions changed. The dress of ancient Greeks and Romans belonged to that period in European history which, educated people then thought, set civilised standards for all time; it was also believed to be closer to nature than modern dress especially the 'straight lacing of English ladies', 'destructive...to health and long life'. But not all sitters wished to be depicted in mythical charades, and the results could sometimes be even more risible than an outmoded bodice - as when Lady Sarah Bunbury, who 'liked eating beefsteaks and playing cricket' was painted by Reynolds sacrificing to the Three Graces.Lady Cockburn's portrait demonstrates the half-way mode most successfully adopted by the artist, and his pleasure in it is reflected by his signing it on the hem of her robe - a wonderfully majestic gold 'drapery'. According to the newly fashionable exaltation of maternity, Augusta Anne, Sir James Cockburn's second wife, is posed with her three children (although separate sittings are recorded for the elder boys). James, the cherub kneeling on the left, born in 1771, became a general; George, born in 1772 and clambering around his mother's neck, grew up to be the admiral whose ship conveyed Napoleon to exile on St Helena; the baby, William, born that June, entered the Church and became Dean of York. The commission must have reminded Reynolds of the traditional allegorical image of Charity as a woman with three children; he probably knew Van Dyck's painting (now in the National Gallery, but then in an English private collection) or the famous engraving after it, for his composition resembles it in many details.Where Van Dyck's Charity gazes up to Heaven, however, Lady Cockburn turns her profile to us and looks lovingly at her eldest son. Despite George's mischievous address to the viewer - probably to be imagined as his Papa - the composition echoes Michelangelo's grand and severe sibyls on the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The colour accent of the brilliant macaw, a favourite pet in Reynolds's household recorded as having perched on the hand of Dr Johnson, was an afterthought, recalling Rubens's use of a similar device. So well did Reynolds succeed in lending Lady Cockbum 'the general air of the antique', however, that when the painting was etched for publication, and Sir James objected to his wife's name being exposed in public, the print was entitled Cornelia and her Children after the Roman matron who boasted that her children were her only jewels

During the festivities, at a given signal, the young men of Rome broke into the crowd and, choosing only unmarried maidens of the Sabines, carried them off. The Sabine women accepted their lot. But later a Sabine army attacked the city in force and succeeded in overcoming part of it.

14428-103fried.jpg	If nothing more were known of the painter, this painting, the so-called 'Tetschen Altar' would command attention for its boldness in creating a devotional image from the materials of landscape. It is both the first masterpiece of one of the greatest Romantic landscape painters and a manifesto for the art of landscape itself. It exemplifies two important achievements of early Romanticism: the elevation of nature to a kind of religion, and of landscape to equal or surpass history painting.The 34-year-old painter was inordinately proud of the work. It was the largest he had painted so far, in a medium in which he was still far from proficient, and he had designed the frame himself - a Gothic arch with the eye of God and the wheat and vine of the Eucharist. He had intended the picture as a gift to the Swedish king Adolphus IV, in recognition of his resistance to Napoleon, but was persuaded instead to sell it to Count von Thun-Hohenstein for his castle in Tetschen, Bohemia. With its splendid frame it was transformed from political gesture to religious image, but still it remained a landscape. Nature itself was imbued with religious feeling.The painting's carved frame is based on a concept by Friedrich, but was executed by one of his friends, the sculptor Gottlieb Christian K�hn

43119-offering.jpg	In the last quarter of the sixteenth century Munich was the most important bastion of the Counter Reformation beyond the Alps. It was in Munich that a representative Jesuit church, St. Michael's, was built on German soil. Work on both the interior and the exterior, modelled on Il Ges&#249; in Rome, was carried out by an international group of artists, who in addition to the Italians, were all Netherlandish and German masters trained in Italy.Friedrich Sustris won the commission to design the altars of the church. The painting on the high altar was executed by Christoph Schwarz based on a drawing by Sustris. The two panels depicting the sacrificial offerings of the Old and New Testaments, one on each wing of the transept were executed by one of Sustris's colleagues, Antonio Maria Viani

16085-mary01.jpg	The six scenes on the wall opposite to the scenes from the life of Joachim show the Birth of the Virgin, the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple, and the four episodes pertaining to her marriage: the Rods brought to the Temple, the Prayer of the Suitors, the Marriage of the Virgin and the Wedding Procession.The birth of the Virgin takes place in the same house as the annunciation to Anne. In the small room, somewhat too narrow for the figures, Anne sits up in bed and is handed the baby in its swaddling clothes by a nursemaid. The child appears for a second time in the idyllic scene in front of the mother's bed. As in the Annunciation scene, Giotto also shows the view of the building from outside.

17010-nuenen25.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 117, JH 946.In the autumn of 1885 van Gogh painted the Still-Life with Open Bible in which he juxtaposed his own preferences and ideas with those of his father who was the Minister of the small Reformed congregation in Nuenen, and who had difficulties understanding his son's life-style and the choices van Gogh made as a painter.The painting is dominated by the Bible, a fine and huge edition, sober, melancholy, leather-bound, pathetic. Beside it is an extinguished candle, a traditional prop in any memento mori picture; this symbol of transience and death is sufficient to link the picture to the death of van Gogh's father. In the foreground, modest yet insistent too, is a well-thumbed yellow copy of Zola's novel La joie de vivre. The metaphoric polarity implied by the juxtaposition of this book with the Bible is plain: the Bible was the father's source of authority, while the novel represented a belief that there are other things in modern life besides wisdom that has been handed down through thousands of years

07485-15cather.jpg	"The painting formerly belonged to Cardinal Del Monte, one of the artist's patrons.Here we see a single female figure in an interior devoid of architectural allusions. The image appears with a boldness and an immediacy that combine the nobility of the subject (St Catherine was a king's daughter) with the almost plebeian pride of the model (no doubt a Roman woman of the people, who appears on other paintings of the artist, too). The breadth of conception and realization, and the perfect mastery of a very difficult composition (the figure and objects completely fill the painting, in a subtle play of diagonals) are striking. Caravaggio here chose a ""grand"" noble approach that heralds the great religious compositions he would soon do for San Luigi dei Francesi. The extraordinary virtuosity in the painting of the large, decorated cloth is absorbed as an integral part of the composition. This is something his followers would not often succeed in doing, for they frequently dealt with the single components of the painting individually, with adverse effects on the unity of the whole"

No other Umbrian depictions of the Annunciation in this period present anything like this elaborate architecture or the vast landscape beyond.

23951-sjerome.jpg	This relatively small panel shows a subject that became very popular in Venetian painting in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, thanks above all to the example of Giovanni Bellini. Mansueti shows many of the details that had already become conventional for paintings of the subject: the crucifix, the lion, the rustic dwelling, the discarded cardinal's robe and hat, and symbols of human mortality, such as the skull and hourglass. But in contrast to St Jerome pictures by Bellini and by other Venetian painters such as Cima and Lotto, Mansueti packs his composition with an enormous amount of further detail: a bear, a stoat, a dog, a deer, a rabbit, two monkeys, and two leopards in the foreground; a shepherd with sheep and cows in the right middleground; a river with gondoliers, washerwomen, swans and ducks, also in the middleground; and winding roads, with a man and his donkey, and other men walking and riding, leading the eye to a church, a castle, and distant mountains in the background. The overall effect is cluttered. Nevertheless, in part because of the very naivety of the expression, the picture communicates a sense of delight in an orderly, domesticated world, where God's creatures, human and animal, coexist in peace and harmony

19701-vase2.jpg	Hiepes has created an illusion of three dimensionality in the floral arrangement by showing the flowers in the middle of the composition projecting forwards and from a frontal view, and those towards the extremities of the composition in profile and some from a back view. However, a marked planarity in the composition is probably a consequence of his method of compiling the flower piece from separate studies, as if he had laid out the bouquet on a flat surface.The images on the Italian vase depict scenes of a classical triumph. Similar images decorate the vases in other flower pieces by Hiepes. Three gilt figures of crouching nude slaves are trampled underfoot by the Roman emperor and appear to support on their backs the whole arrangement of flowers. The decorative splendour of the vase certainly makes it a suitable recipient for such a magnificent display of flowers

11194-1880s_14.jpg	Around 1880 Degas's grays gave way to brilliant colours, ranging from red to russet, and muted tones were replaced by warm ones. This came with a change in style and technique, in which pastels became his dominant medium. Degas was the only nineteenth-century painter who made pastels his primary medium. He saw that pastels struck a balance between painting and drawing, enabling him to paint while drawing. Furthermore, he expanded the possibilities offered by pastels by combining them with gouache, watercolour, oils mixed freely with turpentine, and even monotypes

07452-01bacch.jpg	Among Caravaggio's early works, this painting, in which the pose of the arm may recall his debt to the Persian Sibyl in a fresco by Peterzano, belongs to the small group which has always been seen as self-portraits. The livid colours of the subject's face, his teasing smile and the mock seriousness of his mythological dignity all reinforce the attempt to undermine the lofty pretensions of Renaissance artistic traditions. Here is no god, just a sickly young man who may be suffering from the after-effects of a hangover. There is no mistaking the artist's delight in the depiction of the fine peaches and black grapes on the slab, the white grapes in his hand and the vine leaves that crown his hair, but the artist is not content merely to demonstrate his superb technique: he wishes to play an intimate role and only the slab separates him from the viewer. His appearance is striking rather than handsome: he shows both that his face is unhealthy and that his right shoulder is not that of a bronzed Adonis, as convention required, but pale as in the case of any man who normally wears clothes

04176-aretino.jpg	"The source for the picture's subject is Carlo Ridolfi's book, Le Maraviglie dell'arte (1648). Aretino had spoken badly of Tintoretto. When they met one day Tintoretto invited Aretino to his studio to have his portrait done. During the sitting the painter suddenly pulled out a dagger from his robe. The surprised Aretino believed he was seeking revenge, and cried out and asked what he wanted. Tintoretto replied coldly, ""Don't move. I am taking your measurements."" Suitably intimidated by the incident, Aretino never again spoke badly of Tintoretto and they ultimately became friends. Bergeret's picture depicting Tintoretto brandishing a pistol, like those of his fellow artists Ingres and Alexander-Evariste Fragonard, differs from the account due apparently to a translator's confusion over the Italian word for dagger, ""pistolese."

00248-visitat.jpg	Mariotto Albertinelli, the pupil of Cosimo Rosselli, ran a workshop with Fra Bartolomeo, and like him shared an interest in the painting of Perugino, whose illuminating example is apparent in this work, unanimously considered to be his masterpiece.

31917-flowers1.jpg	Antonio Ponce was an apprentice and, probably, an assistant of Juan van der Hamen who enjoyed a long career at the court of Madrid as a specialist painter of still-lifes and flower pieces. This flower painting, and its pendant in the same private collection, representing glass vases of flowers standing on a stone ledge, follows the most conventional of formats for flower paintings. As flower paintings became important decorative features in the homes of the period, they were increasingly conceived as pendant paintings and, indeed, as decorative series of works. Moreover, the stone ledges on which the flowers rest enter the pictures from opposite sides, a feature that would have permitted their owner to hang them on either side of a central element, such as a window, a painting or piece of furniture, with the perspective of the ledges appearing to converge on a central point.Ponce has meticulously studied the play of light on the petals of the flowers, carefully tracing their edges with thin strokes of white paint and applying highlights as a series of hatched brushstrokes in light paint. Personal factors probably explain the depth of Van der Hamen's influence on Ponce's flower paintings: the older artist was a pioneer in this genre in Madrid and had taught the younger artist to paint. Ponce's faith in the aesthetic principles of Van der Hamen appear to be in direct contrast with the spirited touch exemplified in the works of his younger contemporaries, such as Juan de Arellano and Gabriel de la Corte.

42259-0504vela.jpg	Five equestrian portraits, those of Philip III, Queen Margarita, Isabella of Bourbon, Philip IV, and Prince Baltasar Carlos, belonged to the colossal decorative scheme of the Hall of the Realms in the Buen Retiro Palace. The scheme was organized by the Count-Duke of Olivares, with the aim of affirming the glory of the Spanish Monarchy during what was in fact a period of decline.Philip IV on Horseback was of course the most important item in this cycle. The king is shown here in all his absolute might and power enjoying, as a contemporary account puts it, a triumph such as few heroes of the past or present could boast. Seventeenth-century Spanish horses, bred from crosses with Arab stallions, were famous for their proud bearing and temperamental beauty. Vel�zquez had the opportunity of observing them daily in the royal stables or when the king put them through their paces. The curvet represented the peak of equestrian skill, the moment when the rider had to gather all his strength together, and in this picture the king is making his mount curvet. Baroque art also understood this pose as signifying the sovereignty with which a monarch tamed the unruly power of the people or the animal savagery of an enemy.In line with these ideas, and in a picture now lost, Rubens had already shown Philip IV on horseback triumphing over his enemies. Vel�zquez does not call upon the emotionally highly charged background usual in Rubens, nor does he employ any grand allegorical accessories. He also does not exaggerate the king's size by placing him in front of a very low horizon with tiny soldiers in the middle ground, as the Flemish master did in his portrait of Philip II. While Vel�zquez uses a more restrained pictorial rhetoric than Rubens, his royal horseman is livelier and more elegant than the subject in another famous painting - Titian's Charles V at M�hlberg. The pure profile emphasizes the fine outline of man and beast, and contrasts the rising movement of the horse with the falling slope of an extensive and idealized landscape. Its pigmentation, shot with beautiful shades of green and blue, is reminiscent of sixteenth-century Flemish landscapes

28920-port_gen.jpg	That the subject of this haunting portrait was a soldier is apparent from the shiny pieces of plate armour (of local manufacture) at his feet and from his costume of leather doublet, chain mail, under-doublet of black satin and the plain white linen collar of the shirt worn beneath. (The long sword is less a military appurtenance than a badge of nobility.) His legs are encased in black trunks and hose; he wears a brace to correct the weakening of the muscles of his left ankle, a condition known as 'drop-foot', caused either by disease or a wound. His Italian nickname, 'Il Cavaliere dal Piede Ferito' (Knight of the Wounded Foot), refers to this. Standing firm with legs wide apart, he leans lightly on a magnificent jousting helmet crested with ostrich plumes and surmounted by a red disk, carved with the sun's face, from which rises a rare and costly osprey feather. Less extravagant ostrich plumes curl on his black velvet cap.Like many of Moroni's sitters the cavaliere is posed against a shallow light-coloured background of marble and part-ruined stone to which ivy, emblem of fidelity, clings and from which seedlings sprout. The background serves many functions: it justifies the semblance of outdoor light while keeping our attention from wandering off through a distant landscape; it sets off the sitter's slender silhouette with its complex outline; its neutral tone combines and echoes the hard colours of costume and helmet, and the matt surface provides a foil for the whole range of textures in the sitter's dress, armour, flesh and hair; it provides a geometric grid within which the figure is firmly anchored; and it furnishes a ledge on which to place the helmet and give the sitter something to do with his left arm, motivating the hand's negligently elegant gesture. Finally, the eroded architecture suggests endurance, a metaphor for the knight himself

34183-archimed.jpg	The image we have today of the ancient scholar owes much to the classicistic ideals of the 19th century. This concept of cool distance and noble gravity is contradicted sharply by such a painting as Ribera's Archimedes: the great physicist, mathematician and natural scientist is shown here as a toothless old Spaniard. His weathered, wrinkled face has none of the marbled pallor of scholarship. In one thin hand, he holds a pile of papers and in the other a compass. His nails are dirty, his dress unkempt, and an old cloak is thrown carelessly over his undershirt, open to reveal his chest. Archimedes looks at us with a broad grin, and seems as close to the everyday life of Ribera's contemporaries as the artist's paintings of the saints. We find no monumental dignity here, only the dignity of a strong personality

03327-christ4e.jpg	His Roman trip and contact with the confident, accomplished frescoes of Raphael and Michelangelo in the Vatican seem actually to have precipitated an artistic crisis that Fra Bartolomeo was never to resolve fully. The Christ with the Four Evangelists (or Salvator Mundi), datable to 1516, the year before his death, is a glorification of the Mass. The Apollonian Christ stands precariously with his arms outstretched on an altar shelf, surrounded by the Four Evangelists holding books. Below, putti enframe a circular view into a landscape like a porthole, with the covered chalice teetering precariously above and on an axis with Christ, who appears to rise from it. Firmly centralized and balanced, the figures betray quotations from Raphael, although the painter's resolutions are never quite as majestic as the conceptions promise. The shallow space is articulated by the flat, planar architecture and the grandiose niche. The four figures who stand on the raised platform are completely dominated by Christ.Fra Bartolomeo's figures fail to fully convince the spectator of their anatomical accuracy or of their physical presence. It is in the compositional inventions and the grand conceptions that the Frate made his most powerful contribution to Renaissance art. What he lacked in soaring artistic spirit he made up for in devotional earnestness

26070-19coin.jpg	Apart from the Portrait of a Man in Florence, this is the only Memling portrait in which the subject looks directly at the viewer. The two works share other features too: the buttoned-up black tunic without fur edging; the shirt folded over the collar; the short black bonnet worn over dark, curly hair; the composition of the landscape; and the serrated edges of the clouds in the sky. They have thus been compared repeatedly. The man holds a coin in his left hand, which persuaded earlier authors to identify him as a medallist. It was suggested that the sitter was Niccol&#242; di Forzore Spinelli, who died in Lyons, where the painting was purchased in the early nineteenth century. Others believed him to be Giovanni de Candida, but an authenticated portrait of Candida does not resemble the sitter of this work. The different authors were, however, at least able to agree that he was an Italian, a fact supported, in their view, by his appearance and the solitary palm tree in the landscape. The tree and the coin might well have an emblematic function, but there is no reason to interpret the former as a symbol of the subject's nationality.The coin has been identified as a sestertius, struck in Lyons under Emperor Nero. The coin and the palm tree were link with the possible name of the subject: Nero (Neri, del Nero, Nerone, de Niro, etc.) and Palma (Palmieri) are common Italian forenames and surnames. Pictograms were popular motifs at the time, especially in Italian humanist circles. A third element, comprises the laurel leaves that appear at the bottom, just above the edge, which the man might be holding in his concealed right hand. This is another commonly used emblem in Italy, where it appears in coats-of-arms or denotes a name (Lorenzo, Allori). It is entirely possible, therefore, that the man wished his full name (three parts, including his father's name) to be incorporated in the portrait after the Italian fashion.The work was originally identified as an Antonello da Messina, and even as his self-portrait. The portrait was first attributed to Memling in 1871. It is usually dated to the very beginning of the artist's career. In view of the clothing and style, this portrait was certainly not painted before 1480

41142-triptych.jpg	The triptych showing Christ on the Cross between the Virgin and St John the Evangelist on the central panel and St John the Baptist and St Barbara on the wings, found its way to the Munich Museum from the castle of P&#228;hl, which belonged to the diocese of Augsburg. It has no close relations in the painting of the period, but a host of distant ones, therefore by now it is impossible to establish exactly where it was produced. In terms of its style and iconography, it has the greatest number of links with the art of the Master of Trebon. This, however, does not prove that it originated in Bohemia. Arguments have been expressed according to which it may have been produced in Augsburg, Salzburg or Munich, but the affinity of the triptych with the art of Jacquerio, Michelino da Besozzo and Stefano da Zevio has also been pointed out.The representation radiates calmness and does not elicit passionate feelings. It was created with the intention of making the worshipper immerge in prolonged pious prayer. The meagre space of the scene is absolutely abstract: as though a golden curtain with a rhomboid pattern were stretched in the background. Not even the texture of the neutral brownish ground is suggested. On the other hand, it is not only the figures, but even the cross made of gnarled, thick wood and depicted three-dimensionally in a foreshortened way that almost seems as if you could touch it. By this the picture becomes a kind of vision, which stands out from its neutral surroundings and appears to exist only for the spectator. In addition to the calmness of the figures who are submerged in their own thoughts and feelings, it is also the equilibrium and the symmetrical rhythmic construction that contribute to the hornogeneous lyrical mood of the composition. The figure of Christ on the central part is larger than those of the saints on the side-panels, whereas those of the Virgin and St John are smaller. The body of Christ is the lightest and those of the saints on the wings are the darkest areas of the pictures. The cloaks of Mary and of St John are of the most vivid colours, which complement each other. St John is standing closer to the cross than the Virgin, but his body is bent away from it, whilst that of the Virgin is leaning towards it; thus, although their trunks are parallel, the head of Mary is nearer to Christ than to that of St John. Indeed, a contact is established between Christ and His mother by the fact that she is holding up her kerchief because she wants to catch the blood flowing from the wound of the Redeemer's breast. (This is the only movement in the picture that points further than the figure itself.) The similarity of the two cambrics, that of the Virgin's kerchief and Christ's loincloth, creates a further, subtle connection between the two figures

20294-scapegoa.jpg	The concern for direct observation led Hunt to leave for Palestine in 1854 in search of biblical locations. It was to the south of the Dead Sea, at Kharbet Esdun (then identified as the site of Sodom), that he painted the desolate landscape of his Scapegoat. Hunt depicts the animal as an exile living in this uninhabited place, bearing the sins of the Jewish people (according to the Old Testament another goat was sacrificed, and it is this one, drowned in the sea, whose horns can be seen on the left). The white goat, symbol of purity, a trickle of blood on its horns, prefigures the Messiah wearing the crown of thorns, who, through his Passion, was to redeem the sins of the world. This personal interpretation of the Holy Scriptures surprised people when the work was submitted to the Royal Academy in 1856, but the image nevertheless has a haunting quality about it.

28368-basket_p.jpg	Louise Moillon was the most significant 17th-century French painter of still-lifes. She preferred to paint fruit and flower still-lifes. She painted mostly the motif of a fruit-laden plate or - as in this case - wicker basket on a table. Her colours were always cool, and she did not undergo any significant changes.Peaches (Latin malum persicum) were regarded as a subspecies of apples in the 17th century and were associated with the same symbolism. However, it is unlikely that the artist intended any opposition between the 'Eucharistic' grapes and the peaches as a possible symbol of evil (malum). Rather, the co-occurrence of grapes and peaches was probably prompted by a theory of juices. According to this theory, peaches before a meal prevent drunkenness from excessive wine-drinking

18233-0503grec.jpg	Painted for the central panel of the High Altarpiece of the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, Toledo, the commission which brought him to Spain. This, the first work executed in Spain, is the only painting by El Greco bearing the date of its execution. It is the first large-scale painting by his hand.There is a clear reminiscence of Venetian paintings of the subject, and specifically of Titian's early masterpiece in the church of the Frari in Venice, but the treatment is his own. The Virgin rises as from a chalice formed by the two unified groups on either side of the open tomb, which introduce and extend motifs developed in his Cleansing of the Temple and Healing of the Blind. A complete unity is achieved in this bipartite composition, in which the circle of Apostles, with its contained and concentrated internal movement, or emotion, is continued in the circle of angels with their easy and sympathetic movement around the rising figure of the Virgin. There is a sustained rhythm of the expressions, gestures and surface treatment within each group, and an easy and inevitable connection of one group with another. This is achieved essentially by paint, the measured relationship of the passages of colour over the surface. This also explains his treatment of the draperies, which has its own logic, has no suggestion of conflict, but is also not concerned with disclosing the anatomy beneath.When we compare the The Assumption of the Virgin with the famous painting on the same subject by Titian in the Frari Church in Venice, it becomes clear how new were the paths El Greco took in Spain. Under the influence of Michelangelo he not only found an unusually naturalistic style with monumental figures, but adopted a palette tending towards that of the Roman school. The great luminosity of the painting is striking, an illumination that, probably not coincidentally, conforms with the real light falling on it from above.No other version of the subject is known, but the painting may be regarded as the forerunner of the related composition of the Immaculate Conception, a subject more compatible with El Greco's mystical approach to the Universe

This portrait, one of Christus's earliest signed and dated works, shows van Eyck's influence in the technical virtuosity of the trompe-l'oeil fly and the carved inscription. The sitter, once transformed into a saint by the addition of a halo, is an unknown lay brother of the Carthusian order. The fly is a symbol of decay, a reminder of man's mortality, but it also greatly enhances the fiction of a real person gazing at us from behind a stone ledge in which Christus's signature appears as an incised inscription

44227-seasons4.jpg	Jacob de Wit, a leading representative of Dutch ceiling painting was responsible for a seasonal cycle commissioned by Landgrave Wilhelm VIII for the great galleried hall at Schloss Wilhelmsh�he. This cycle is characteristic of De Wit's works in grisaille, generally allegorical representations of putti, which were popular and internationally sought-after decorations. With their graduated greys, these works - sometimes called 'witjes', in a pun on the name Wit, meaning white - imitate stone bas-relief. The theoretical architectural function of the works is clearly expressed in their organisation as niches with a stele in each.The divinity appropriate to each of the seasons is represented by a bust on a plinth, while a small crowd of putti make merry play with the god's attributes. Winter is represented by Boreas, the North Wind.

35379-13religi.jpg	After Sebastian had survived execution by bowmen and protested publicly against the persecution of the Christians, the Roman Emperor had him slain. The miraculous deliverance of the saint, transfixed by arrows, was regarded even in early times as a parallel to the resurrection of Christ. The figure of the martyr as portrayed by Rubens is also intended to recall the Crucifixion. Bound to a tree, his eyes turned upwards to heaven, he seems only slightly affected by the bleeding wounds. The way in which the bound man twists his body may be taken as a sign of pain but this does not lessen its beauty, which is that of a hero of antiquity.In his Sebastian picture, which must have been painted c. 1614, Rubens realized many of the impressions he had gained during his eight years in Italy (1600&#151;08). The sculptural, corporeal quality of the saint's figure reminds one both of the antique and of Michelangelo's works. The contrasting light and shade and the realistic treatment of detail were touches that Rubens had learned from Caravaggio. But in combining the statuesque figure with the atmosphere of an evening landscape, the Flemish painter surpassed his Roman master. Here the tragedy of the event finds adequate expression in the language of nature.In a letter of 1618 to Sir Dudley Carlton, Rubens mentions a selection of his own paintings, which he had kept back in his house 'for his own pleasure' and which he was prepared to exchange for works of art in the possession of the English diplomat. Among the pictures included in the painter's offer is a 'naked Saint Sebastian by my hand', in all probability the one now in Berlin

33190-selfport.jpg	Carl Rahl was an Austrian painter, the son of Carl Heinrich Rahl (1779-1843), an engraver. He attended the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and won a prize at the age of 19. From there he traveled to Munich, Stuttgart, Hungary, and in 1836 to Italy. He remained in Italy from 1836 to 1843, where he in particular studied representatives of the Venetian and Roman schools of art.Rahl's style, especially his views on colour and perspective, were largely formed during his years in Rome. He returned after 1843 to Vienna for two years, and then led an itinerant life for the next five years, traveling through Holstein, Paris, Rome, Copenhagen, and Munich, making a living as a portrait painter.In 1850, he was appointed professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, but for political reasons he was soon dismissed from the position. He then opened a private art school, which expanded quickly into a studio that produced monumental-scale paintings and enjoyed considerable success. He was commissioned by Greek philanthropist Simon Sinas to paint a number of works for the fa�ade and vestibule of Vienna's Fleischmarkt Greek Church. In addition, Sinas commissioned four paintings depicting heroes of the Greek War of Independence, and a further four paintings to decorate his residence.Rahl decorated the Heinrichshof in 1861 with personifications of Art, Friendship, and Culture, and the Palais Todesco with representations from the mythology of Paris. In 1864, he painted a number of allegorical figures in the stairway of the Waffenmuseum (now part of the Kunsthistorisches Museum). In this period he also painted several frescoes: M&#228;dchen aus der Fremde (in a villa of Gmunden), a composition for a ballroom of a palace in Oldenburg, and a cycle from the tale of the Argonauts.In his later years he painted scenic backdrops for the New Opera (Neue Oper), which were continued after his death by his pupils

14046-madon_ch.jpg	This is a wonderfully delicate early work. The small panel can be read almost as an experimental exercise, produced by an artist at the very start of his career. The geometrical frame is defined with precision and is enlivened by a beaded garland of the type used by Mantegna. Foppa is tentative but full of poetry in the way he portrays the Virgin and Child, who, unusually, is dressed in a Roman-style singlet - another borrowing from Mantegna, as is the Roman lettering on the surround. In the painting emotion is controlled, gesture is lightly drawn, tones are dull, flesh has a silvery gray quality. This is all part of Foppa's constant attention to the quiet reality of everyday life. Foppa's human realism was to become the basis upon which Lombard painting developed

21914-hercules.jpg	A series of recent studies and acquisitions have led to something of a new attitude towards painting in the 18th century. Until fairly recently, the art of this period was considered to be rather inferior, despite the high artistic output, because of its perceived lack of innovation. On the one hand, Flemish artists of the 18th century continued to live off the inheritance of Rubens, whose art seemed unsurpassable. Artists such as Pieter Jozef Verhaghen worked entirely in the tradition of Rubens.Meanwhile, other artists had fallen under the spell of France with its trend-setting rococo artists. This development was, however, rather out of character with Flemish artistic tradition, and encountered a certain degree of resistance in the art world. Andries Cornelis Lens had to run the gauntlet of these difficulties in Antwerp where he strove to renew both painting and artistic education. In 1763, Lens became the director of the Antwerp Academy, and to show his gratitude, he donated the work Hercules Protects Painting from Ignorance and Envy - an allegory in which his new task was clearly expressed.

07241-canal610.jpg	Toward the end of the 1730s fewer and fewer tourists came to Venice as a result of the increasing threat of war throughout Europe. That also spelled the end of the blossoming production of topographical souvenirs, which was the mainstay of Canaletto's studio. Joseph Smith, the artist's agent and protector, tried for several more years to attract commissions for painted series of ancient Roman monuments or so-called 'vedute ideate'. A veduta ideata, or idealized view was based on an actual situation. This kind of veduta was beautified, however, or rather improved, by adding buildings from elsewhere or even entirely fictive architectural elements. Such land- and cityscapes illustrated the 'ideal' architecture practiced by the ancients and, in their footsteps, by the sixteenth-century architect Andrea Palladio.In about 1740, besides vedute ideate, Canaletto began to invent much more fantastic variations on the buildings and landscapes he had long painted 'al reale' in the form of 'capricci'. Nor was he alone in this. Tiepolo and Piranesi also published series of fantasy prints called caprices in the 1740s. A contemporary dictionary of art defined a capriccio as 'an artificial and bizarre composition which opposes the rules and beautiful models of nature and art, but which pleases through a certain lively particularity and a free and bold execution.' Conceived in that sense, the capriccio is the opposite of a veduta ideata, and both the etched and the painted caprices that Canaletto made during the early 1740s meet that description. The present canvas is one of the most beautiful examples.Across two islands or peninsulas, connected by an impossibly fragile arched bridge, the eye is led toward a third, distant island in the Lagoon, behind which others appear. From the bridge a path leads to the right over a second, small bridge to a gate in Renaissance forms with a curious passageway placed crosswise, with a tiled roof crowned by a stone statue standing guard. To the right are the remains of a wall and a tower, like the gate partly decorated with stone facings. To the left of the bridge a path runs to a chapel with an asymmetrical roof, a tall aisle with a balcony and a loggia on the right side. Behind the campanile rises a fa�ade with a sign indicating that it is an inn. On the third island stands a heavy, square tower. The time is about sunset; on the left, a pale moon rises. A washerwoman, travellers and fishermen populate the scene.On closer inspection it appears that, with his supposedly randomly selected elements, Canaletto actually ordered his composition entirely in accordance with traditional practice. The placement of the elements in space and the manner in which the eye is led into the distance along the imaginary buildings in leaps is harmonious rather than abrupt. The appealing melancholy evoked by the scene is new; it is the result of the ostensible purposelessness of these friendly structures which are arranged haphazardly in the quiet light of the setting sun and the rising moon.In Canaletto's art, a strict distinction between veduta ideata and capriccio seems difficult to maintain. No wonder he referred to his own series of etched landscapes as 'views partly taken from life, partly imagined.

12550-6martyr.jpg	The altarpiece depicts the legend of the ten thousand Christians who were martyred on Mount Ararat, in a massacre perpetrated by the Persian King Saporat on the command of the Roman Emperors Hadrian and Antonius. D�rer had depicted this massacre a decade earlier in a woodcut. The painting was commissioned by Frederick the Wise, who owned relics from the massacre, and it was placed in the relic chamber of his palace church in Wittenberg. Although D�rer had never before tackled a painting with so many figures, he succeeded in integrating them into a flowing composition using vibrant colour.D�rer's gruesome scene depicts scores of Christians meeting a violent death in a rocky landscape, providing a veritable compendium of tortures and killings. The oriental potentate in the blue cloak and turban who is directing the action in the lower right corner of the picture, would in D�rer's time have been perceived as a reference to the threat of Turkish invasion, because of the seizure of Constantinople in 1453. In the centre of the painting is the rather incongruous figure of the artist, holding a staff with the inscription: `This work was done in the year 1508 by Albrecht D�rer, German.' The man walking with him through this scene of carnage is probably the scholar Konrad Celtis, a friend of D�rer's who had died just before the painting was completed

42214-0113vela.jpg	Even in Seville, where he was accepted into the painters' guild of St Luke before he was eighteen and then, in 1620, opened a workshop and employed apprentices himself, Vel�zquez was already embarking on portraiture, a path that would lead him to a place among the major portraitists in the history of art.

12972-duquesno.jpg	In this portrait by Anthony van Dyck, a brown-haired man, wearing a beard and a moustache, is represented in three-quarter profile, turned to the left against a dark, uniform background. He is wearing a dark cloth garment, decorated with a ruff and white cuffs, and holds a stone sculpted head representing a satyr. The dark colours serve to emphasise the sitter's attentive gaze and elegant hand, whilst the vivacity of the face contrasts with the immobility of the sculpture. For a long time this painting was held to be a portrait of the Brussels sculptor Fran�ois Duquesnoy, who lived and worked in Rome from 1618 to 1643, where he developed a classical style that was strongly influenced by his study of antique sculpture and by the works of French painter Nicolas Poussin. This portrait would then have been painted during a trip that Anthony van Dyck made to Rome around 1622/23, where he supposedly struck up a friendship with the sculptor.However, this famous painting presents problems as to the date of painting and in particular the identity of the sitter. The traditional identification was based on an engraving by Pieter van Bleeck in 1751 from the portrait in the Brussels museum, with an inscription mentioning the sculptor's name and a short biographical text. This has recently been called into question. Bellori's biography of the sculptor, published in 1672, mentions neither a friendship between the two men in Rome, nor a portrait of his compatriot by Van Dyck. What the biography does mention is that Duquesnoy was fair-haired and had blue eyes. Moreover, the engraved portrait illustrating his text, repeated in 1675 by Joachim von Sandrart in the Teutsche Academie, shows little resemblance to the present portrait, nor to the late engraving from it by Pieter van Bleeck. In addition, stylistic analysis has shown that the picture could not belong to Anthony van Dyck's Italian period, but must be placed in his second Flemish period, where the colour range was more contained. This portrait is indeed by Van Dyck, but after his Italian trip, around 1627/29, when the painter was back in the country to which the Brussels sculptor never returned

00125-meatsell.jpg	In the 16th and 17th centuries it was quite common for theologians to see a slaughtered animal as symbolizing the death of a believer. Allusions to the 'weak flesh' (cf. Matthew 16:41) may well have been associated with Aertsen's Butcher's Stall where - like on his fruit and vegetable stalls - a seemingly infinite abundance of meat has been spread out.In this picture, the viewer's senses are immediately assaulted by the profusion of life-size comestibles. Amid fowls, sausages, beef, pork, fish, butter, cheese and pretzel, the eye of a flayed ox's head disconcertingly seems to watch the viewer. Each object is a masterful still-life. Like Lucas van Leyden and some other Netherlandish artists, Aertsen inverted the traditional foreground-subject relationship; his narrative occurs in the background. Almost unnoticed at first, the stall permits glimpses of a tavern on the right and a landscape behind. The ground around the inn is covered with oyster and mussel shells, which in some context - as here - allude to their consumption as an aphrodisiac. Among the tavern's revellers is a prostitute with a possible customer.Meanwhile, groups of people, dressed in contemporary Netherlandish attire, walk through the countryside towards the church visible at the far left. Only the mother riding the donkey stops to give alms to the poor. She is the Virgin Mary. Led by Joseph, she and her son are journeying to Egypt, to escape Herod. This is a very different presentation than the standard flight into Egypt since no idols fall, no miracles occur, no angels or servants direct the way. Although beset by their own troubles, the Holy Family shares what they have with the less fortunate. No halos signal their divinity, rather, Aertsen accented their humanity to construct a moral about daily personal decisions. His pilgrimage of life offers a choice between a materialistic and morally questionable existence on the one hand and the spiritual path of the Holy Family on the other.Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer, his nephew and pupil, popularized peasant and market scenes such as this, which typically contain half-hidden moralizations and religious themes. Through their impetus in Antwerp and Amsterdam, where they painted, peasant and market scenes evolved into a separate artistic specialization around the mid-sixteenth century

44255-oldchurc.jpg	De Witte was born in Alkmaar, the son of a schoolmaster. He worked in Delft and entered the Delft guild in 1642.  By 1652 he settled in Amsterdam where he spent the rest of his life.In Amsterdam de Witte continued to paint views of Delft churches, but he was inspired more often by the metropolis's grand buildings: its Old Church, lofty New Church, Stock Exchange, and, after it was consecrated in 1675, its Portuguese-Jewish Synagogue. By the late fifties the contrast of light and shadow grows stronger and powerful, and he abandons oblique views for more frontal ones. At this time his interiors also become more fanciful. To be sure, other specialists made changes in the architecture they portrayed but de Witte was capable of radically rearranging it to increase massiveness, and to heighten spatial and chiaroscuro effects.He also painted purely imaginary interiors of Catholic and Protestant Gothic and Renaissance churches, and designed others using elements taken from well-known Dutch buildings. But he always convinces us, in an uncanny way, that he has painted a view of a real church.Comparison of this great artist's works with those by Houckgeest and van Vliet shows his wider range, his more powerful spatial effects, and his more interesting pictorial qualities. In general, there is the same noble restraint as in Pieter de Hooch's best genre pieces, Kalf's mature still-lifes, and the grand solemnity of Ruisdael's forest scenes

24183-rebecca.jpg	"A leading figure in Rome's cultural world in the second half of the seventeenth century, Carlo Maratti is a good example of both the strengths and weaknesses of the Baroque. His technical ability was unsurpassed as was his knowledge of formal models. At the same time he seemed to struggle to be creative in a truly innovative fashion. He grew up in the classically-inspired atmosphere of Nicolas Poussin's circle and had close contacts with Bellori, a man of letters. Maratti studied sixteenth-century painting admiringly (especially Raphael and Correggio) and joined the group of Emilian artists who had succeeded the Carracci.Most of his career was spent in Rome where he painted numerous large altarpieces, excellent portraits and fresco cycles, such as the one in Villa Falconieri at Frascati. He was praised as ""Raphael reincarnate"" and became leader of the Roman school after the deaths of Pietro da Cortona and Bernini. His painting was typically polished and flawlessly stylish. He attracted imitators and admirers all over Italy"

08785-madonna.jpg	We know very little about the life of Petrus Christus, though it is certain that in 1444 he obtained the citizenship of Bruges, then the richest town in Flanders and its main artistic centre. He may have been the pupil of Jan van Eyck, and in his surviving panel paintings we can see that his solutions to problems of composition and his figure types are similar to those of his predecessor. Indeed Christus's delicately wrought and brilliantly coloured works served to popularise the technique and manner of Van Eyck.Some fifteen to twenty works by Christus are known, one of which is The Virgin and Child, probably the surviving part of a triptych for home devotion. Framed by a semi-circular arch resting on slender columns and with a pleasant landscape in the background, the Virgin looks tenderly down at the naked Infant supported on her arm. Every detail has been painted with meticulous care - the minute wrinkles on the Infant's face, the foliage of the trees in the distance and the statuette of Adam and Eve on the columns at the sides, which, in alluding to the Fall, emphasize the coming Redemption through Christ. Other versions and copies have survived, indicating the popularity of this picture over the years, but unfortunately none of them give any clue as to when it was painted or who commissioned it

The other group appears blinded and in the grip of a shock wave. The ascension takes place between these two groups: Christ, surrounded by heavenly hosts, appears above the building. He emits golden rays, which envelop the body of the evangelist. They transport the latter to a different sphere and seem like a materialization of the gaze with which Christ looks at John.

21814-tudors.jpg	Van Leemput made a copy of Holbein's mural of the Tudor dynasty painted in 1537 (much praised by van Mander) on the instructions of Charles II. The picture was later destroyed in the Whitehall fire of 1698. The picture showed full-length, life-size figures of Henry VII, founder of the dynasty, and his son Henry VIII, together with their wives Elizabeth of York and Jane Seymour. The picture shows them standing in an ornate Renaissance-style hall around a stone block, the inscription on which extols the virtues of the two kings.

26054-14flore4.jpg	The closed triptych does not feature a grisaille, but the realistic figures of St John the Baptist and St Veronica seen through a richly decorated late-Gothic arch. They are seated before a rocky landscape that continues across both panels, with a broad river in the background. This is the Jordan, and in the distance we see a tiny representation of the Baptism of Christ. The white sculptures on either side of each arch depict Adam and Eve before the Fall (left wing) and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden (right wing) - the events that gave rise to the need for Redemption through the Incarnation (represented by the open triptych). The same two saints are united again in a now dispersed diptych (Munich-Washington), which might have been commissioned as a private devotional work by the same patron.The figure of St John on the reverse of the left wing was held around that period to be a self-portrait of the artist, because Jacob van Oost the Elder made an engraving of it, which he identified in that way

41383-08scene3.jpg	By the fourteenth century the garden had become a subject that could transform even interior spaces into sunny simulacra of nature. The Chambre du Cerf in the palace of the popes at Avignon, painted in 1343, is not a representation of landscape for its own sake, as is sometimes claimed. It shows the activities that took place in nature for privileged groups that were not, like the peasant, bound to the land. Figures engaged in hunting and fishing stand out against the deep green of a forest. For popes, kings, and nobles, the untamed forest was usually something beautiful to be enjoyed in itself, but space to be exploited for the hunt and for its rich resources. The natural in nature was too wild, too loaded with negative associations to be a subject for artists, who always sought to tame nature by making it artifice. This urge to domesticate the wild is an important aspect of secular decoration, in wall paintings and tapestries of the period

15855-cratetes.jpg	Attributed to Strozzi in a nineteenth-century catalogue, this painting was later held to be a work of Ribera. This attribution was modified in favour of Luca Giordano. The majority of scholars have accepted the dating as 1650.The subject was identified as the philosopher Cratetes. Imaginary portraits of ancient philosophers and the representation of events from their lives was very popular in seventeenth-century Italy, Holland and France. The trend can be connected to the new spread of Neostoicism, a philosophical current particularly common to Naples in the 1660's.This painting is closely connected to the several series of philosophers that Giordano painted on the model of Ribera's two philosopher series, both carried out by the Spanish artist in the 1630's. Giordano's and Ribera's philosophers share the strong naturalistic and anti-ideal tendencies that were prized in Neapolitan neo-stoic intellectual circles; circles in which Giordano himself participated. The philosophers are depicted as simple people, dressed in poor clothing and with specific, unidealized physiognomic characterizations that derive directly from the live model.An old copy of this painting, of slightly larger measurements (123 x 98 cm.), is in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich

13149-stpaul_m.jpg	The demand for landscape painting among educated Italian patrons of the Renaissance was stimulated by their reading of Pliny the Elder's first-century Latin text on ancient art. Collectors applied his desciptions of Greek and Roman specialists in different kinds of pictures to their own contemporaries. German and Netherlandish artists, with their magical ability to depict delightful vistas in the backgrounds of religious paintings were soon identified by Italian clients as potential purveyors of 'pastoral' or 'rustic' pictures to rival the effects of the lighter veins of poetry and music. Northerners under the spell of Italian art theory complied with this view.Elsheimer's precious little pictures on copper helped to transform landscape from a decorative adjunct to a major artistic genre. Trained in Germany and Venice and adept at both figure and landscape painting, Elsheimer gave visual form  to two equally exotic impulses: awe of Northern woods and waters, and nostalgia for the ancient Mediterranean past.This paintng belongs to the former category, although it treats two episodes from the Acts of Apostles (27:41-4; 28:1-6): the shipwreck of St Paul on the island of Malta and the miracle of the viper. Barely harder than a human hand, it recreates the effect of multiple illumination to reveal a drama of nature's might, human frailty and divine intervention. Lightning flashes on waves crashing against the shore, the spume rising to the top of gnarled trees clinging to the rocks. A beacon burns on the clifftop. The survivors gathered in the foreground dry their clothes, aided by the natives. As sparks fly upwards, the firelight glows warm on Italianate nudes and a wrinkled Nothern crone

18749-guard215.jpg	Beyond a single column of a ruined portico the spectator looks out upon a large, free-standing house in a landscape reminiscent of the Lagoon. To the left behind the overgrown ruin two other houses can be seen. The right side of the image offers a view of a broad expanse of water with a number of sailing boats, a tower and several undefined buildings in the background. Only a few figures enliven the representation.Guardi based the composition of his caprice on one of Canaletto's etchings, but as usual, his version of the etching was an extremely free adaptation. He borrowed several motifs and omitted others. The etching in question (private collection) shows a landscape with three arches of an arcade in the foreground, behind which a country house and the ruins of Roman monuments can be seen. Guardi has taken the portico, which Canaletto showed intact, but reduced it to a dilapidated fragment; furthermore he has transformed the rectangular forms of the characteristic house in Canaletto's etching into a much less stately, asymmetrical building with a slanted roof.The most remarkable divergence from the print is that in Guardi's painting there is not a single allusion to classical antiquity. The Roman triumphal arch and the temple which are not without importance in Canaletto's print are omitted by the younger painter, as is the classical monument before the house on the left. Because of the picturesque effect, Guardi's view of the Lagoon landscapes seems far less fantastic and above all more authentically 'Venetian' than Canaletto's implausible assemblage of Roman monuments and Venetian buildings.Though the patron or buyer of this painting is not known &#151; as is the case with most of Guardi's work &#151; we may assume that such a typically Venetian version of picturesque nostalgia would have appealed primarily to the city's inhabitants.The loose brushwork with which the forms are reproduced without clear contours as well as the silver-grey and russet shades which characterize the painting are typical of Francesco Guardi's work in the late 1760s, the period in which his style matured fully

40885-07virgin.jpg	The Virgin is carrying the naked Infant Christ, who is sitting on a cloth, in both hands. She is in front of a wall-hanging in red-gold brocade and is clothed in a dark blue garment with a grey fur lining and a mantle of the same colour (in fact it has darkened into blue-green). With his left hand the Child reaches for the hanger of a necklace made of red coral (possibly an allusion to the blood of his sacrifice), and in his other hand he holds a pear (as the fruit of the `new Adam', an allusion to Salvation). The Virgin is situated in front of a golden balustrade with an arcade of rounded arches which encloses the choir of a church with stained-glass windows. She appears behind a golden arch resting on brown marble pillars. The image should probably be interpreted as a Virgin who is standing behind a low wall supporting an arch. The top of this little wall was originally probably visible and seems to have been sawn off.This Virgin-and-Child type is frequently encountered in works by Memling and his followers, sometimes with the Child sitting on the wall. Related examples by Memling are: the Van Nieuwenhove Virgin (Memlingmuseum, Bruges); the Virgin and Child in Lisbon (Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga). A similar type by a Memling follower is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.The little work discussed here is also Memlingian from a stylistic point of view. The type of the Virgin with the bulging forehead, the long straight nose and the narrow bow-shaped eyebrows is particularly closely related to Memling. The faces, however, are flatter and squarer, especially in the case of the Child. Apart from the Virgin type the staffage and architectural surroundings have the same roots: red brocade hangings with vegetally decorated edges, brown marble columns on each side, perspective of a church interior with stained-glass windows consisting of small coloured squares

08276-tobias.jpg	The story is recounted in the Book of Tobit. Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight.The painting was restored

17973-00chapel.jpg	"The cycle of St Francis in Montefalco contains a total of 19 episodes from the life and work of the saint, arranged in a total of 12 pictures and a lost stained glass window. The cycle of pictures extends above the choir stalls along the five walls of the apsidal chapel, in three rows arranged one above the other. In contrast to the customary direction of reading, the series starts at the bottom left with the birth of St Francis and ends at the top right with his Ascension.This unusual narrative method from the bottom upwards is inconsistent with the method in which wall paintings are produced, for they are always painted from the top downwards. An explanation for the atypical direction of reading is offered by the sequence of the pictures. Starting at the left in the bottom row with the Birth and ending at the outermost lunette field with the Ascension, Benozzo narrates the saint's life as a journey from the earthly to the divine realms. In keeping with this, the sequence of pictures ends in the six vaulted fields with St Francis in glory with five saints from the Franciscan order.The scene following the Vision of the Church Militant and Triumphant was depicted on a lost stained glass window that originally decorated the narrower central wall of the choir, and which has now been replaced by an unpainted arched window. The theme can be reconstructed thanks to the inscription that has survived beneath the window's slope: QUALITER B. F. IN ECCLESIA SANCTI DAMIANI AUDIVIT CRUCIFIXUM TERDICENTEM SIBI FRANCISCE VADE REPARA DOMUM MEM ET QUIA IAM CADIT VERSA QUANTITATEM PECUNIAE IN QUANDAM FENESTRAM - ""How St Francis heard the crucified Christ in the church of San Damiano say three times: Go, and restore my house! And as it is already collapsing, throw an amount of money into the window.""Here, therefore, the praying St Francis was depicted in front of the crucifix in San Damiano, the Vision of San Damiano as it is known. The execution of the scene as a stained glass window was a subtle choice, as St Francis was being requested to throw money in through the church's window.Finally, 23 medals decorate the narrow strip of wall between the frescoes and the choir stalls. On the north and south walls, in a kind of family tree, 20 Franciscan monks are depicted. They are derived from the ""Vitae Crucifixae Jesu Christi"" by Ubertino da Casale, dating from 1305. There is space for only three medals on the short strip of wall beneath the window. They show portraits of three famous Florentines: Dante, Giotto and Petrarch.In about 1290, one of the most extensive cycles on the life of St Francis was created by Giotto in the upper church of San Francesco in Assisi. The relevance of this cycle here is that Benozzo knew it and made use of it without following it continuously. Benozzo differs from his famous model in the choice and sequencing of the scenes. He depicts events from the saint's life. What are missing are the miracles, depicted in Assisi, which Francis worked after his death. However, Benozzo not only broke with the customary chronology, he also proved his inventiveness and independence in the narration of unusual occurrences"

19559-delcourt.jpg	Van der Helst's life-size Abraham del Court and Maria de Keersegieter of 1654 shows him at the top of his form as a portraitist of private patrons. The drawing of the elegant married couple seated in a garden is faultless and the rendering of their costly garments, the very last word in haut couture among the elite circles, is rendered with technical perfection. Nothing is known about del Court as a connoisseur of painting but he certainly was an expert on textiles. He was a cloth merchant and served a term as an official of Amsterdam's textile guild. He must have taken as much delight as his wife did in van der Helst's depiction of Maria's silvery-white satin gown enhanced by the play of light on the silver braid along its front and lower edge. The thorny rose Maria holds probably alludes to the pains and pleasures of love, the fountain in the garden to fecundity, and del Court's gentle support of his wife's wrist to the concord of their joined status.Van der Helst received more commissions than he could handle and not all of them attain the high quality of the del Court double portrait. Marked variations in execution of signed paintings done in the same year signal that he employed assistants to help him meet the demand. One is documented: in I652 Marcus Waltersz (or Waltusz) agreed to paint and serve him for twelve months for three guilders, three stuivers per week. His contract stipulated he was to work for ten hours a day during the summer months and from dawn until dusk during the winter. For his part van der Helst agreed to teach him as much as possible, and further, on days when Marcus was scheduled to act at the theatre his master was to give him the afternoon free without docking his weekly wage. Nothing more is known about Marcus's activity as an aspiring painter or actor

A lady dressed in a yellow jacket with borders of ermine occupies the center of the composition. She is seated at a table, turned toward the left. Her right hand firmly secures the quill that she is prepared to use. In the meantime, she gazes at the viewer. This is a very elegant, though somewhat dark, interior, the only light coming from an unseen source at the left. It bathes the lady and the table, leaving everything else in a warm penumbra. One used to think that this was a portrait in disguise, an assumption that cannot be maintained in view of the quizzical expression of the sitter, who looks pensively beyond the picture frame into space. The painting on the rear wall, probably representing a skull and other paraphernalia, has plausibly been identified with a work by C. van der Meulen.Vermeer shows himself here again as an exquisite painter of detail.

08930-martyrdo.jpg	The centrally planned sixth-century church of San Stefano Rotondo was restored under Gregory XIII, partly in accordance with his papal bull of 1580 uniting the colleges for German and Hungarian Jesuits at the site. Around the periphery of the interior of the church, Niccol&#38;#242; Circignani, who had worked for the pope at the Vatican Palace, led a team of artists that painted a fresco cycle of thirty-one scenes of explicitly graphic martyrdoms. Beginning with Christ's Crucifixion, it continues through the execution of the Apostles and early Christian saints - appropriate subjects for the Early Christian martyrial structure. The cycle derives from a book commissioned by Ignatius of Loyola to instruct the faithful and to provide a focus for meditation on the Gospel stories through both notes and images. The frescoes are notable for their blatant didacticism, uniting words to images. Each martyrdom carries a hortatory biblical  inscription across the top and each has double caption below - one text in Latin, another translating Latin into Italian - which identifies the figures in the painting.The series of frescoes were engraved by Giovanni Battista de' Cavalieri and published in a book by Bartolomeo Grassi in 1585 in Rome. At the beginning of the 17th century, the book was reworked in a laterally reversed format by Jan van Haelbeck and published in Paris by Jean Leclerc

32131-did_tulp.jpg	Potter worked for the court in The Hague, in nearby Delft, and in 1652 he settled in Amsterdam. According to Houbraken Nicolaes Tulp persuaded him to move to the metropolis where the famous doctor became his mentor. If true, once again Tulp showed he had an eye for young talent. Two decades earlier he had asked the twenty-six-year-old Rembrandt to paint the Anatomy Lesson which established Rembrandt's reputation in the city. In 1653 Potter painted a life-size equestrian portrait which has been traditionally identified as his likeness of Tulp's son Dirck (Diederik); however, the tradition may very well be apocryphal. The portrait proves that Potter was no exception to the rule that seventeenth-century Dutch painters never match the life-size equestrian portraits of royalty and their ministers by Vel�zquez, Rubens, or Van Dyck.

32196-02apollo.jpg	Two pictures that are very much more Venetian in their inspiration are the Munich Apollo and Daphne and the Louvre Triumph of Flora, whose subjects are taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Throughout his career Poussin liked to dwell on themes of transformation, especially those found in stories from classical antiquity. Apollo pursues Daphne, and to escape his clutches she is transformed into a laurel tree. The theme has a poetic melancholy, and this melancholy is also present to a certain extent in the much more cheerful Flora.The mythological story of Apollo and Daphne is the following.The nymph Daphne, the daughter of the river god Peneus, was the first and most celebrated of Apollo's loves, and was popular with artists in all ages. According to Ovid, Cupid, in a spiteful mood, was the cause. He struck Apollo with a golden arrow, the sort that kindles love, Daphne with a leaden one that puts love to flight. The god pursued the unwilling girl, and, when she had no more strength to flee, she prayed to her father to save her. Whereupon branches sprouted from her arms, roots grew from her feet, and she was changed into a laurel tree.The theme symbolizes the victory of Chastity over Love

It depicts the Erection of the Commemorative Statue of Marcantonio Colonna on the Capitol. The scene belongs to the cycle on the ceiling illustrating decisive events from the military career of Marcantonio II Colonna (1535-1584). In its form and composition the narrative cycle borrows from sixteenth-century Venetian painting, which beginning with Veronese had specialised in depictions on ceilings of historical events viewed from extremely low vantage points.The cycle is a collective work by Filippo Gherardi and Giovanni Coli, the architecture painting and framing is by Johann Paul Schor and his workshop

07170-canal213.jpg	This painting belongs to the second pair of the four paintings ordered by Stefano Conti in 1725 from Canaletto. The first pair of waterscapes were joined by two views of church squares, compositions that Canaletto was to re-use frequently. The popularity of the subject is hardly surprising. The Scuola di San Marco, decorated with paintings by Gentile Bellini and Carpaccio, the large Dominican church of SS Giovanni e Paolo, and Verrocchio's statue of the famous condottiere Bartolomeo Colleoni, were among the best-known monuments of the city; the combination of the three in one composition therefore made perfect sense. Carlevaris had included a similar view in his series of etchings entitled Le Fabriche, e Vedute di Venetia of 1704.As is often the case with Canaletto's compositions, the original idea was Carlevaris's, but the older master had lacked the talent to do much with it. Here Canaletto opted for the traditional vanishing point on the central axis, which irresistibly draws the eye into the depth of the composition. In the exhibited work the vanishing point lies just behind the lefthand corner of the Scuola di San Marco; the massive structures that constitute the main subject of the picture are thus situated almost entirely to the right of the central axis. At first sight the fa�ade of the Scuola seems to close off the scene in the distance, but the small bridges along its left flank guide the eye an astonishing distance from the city, as far as the trees on the island of San Michele.To the left, the composition is balanced by the darkness of the Rio dei Mendicanti and the heavy shadow which hangs over the area behind it; a cloud outside the perimeter of the painting provides a pattern of light and darkness in the sky. Again, the sunlight is sultry rather than radiant

22623-03coron.jpg	Lippi's second prominent altarpiece, the Coronation of the Virgin for the main altar of Sant'Ambrogio, was painted in the decade after the Barbadori Altarpiece. The cast of characters has expanded dramatically with a host of accompanying saints in the zone below, pictured in a puzzlingly smaller scale in relation to those at the sides. Saint Ambrogio, the patron of the church, and Saint John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, dominate the sides of the composition. Mary is crowned not by Christ, but by God the Father in an expanded lunette above. The picture betrays a joyous, decorative appearance calibrated by strong colours which are highlighted by the white lilies.The Coronation, despite certain inconsistencies, is a visual treat, since a recent cleaning has unveiled a wealth of vigorous although unnaturalistic colour. Here is a beatified world without conflict or blemish; the participants are untroubled, heavenly creatures undisturbed by self-doubts. Lippi's handsome figures, constructed sumptuously and optimistically, are much like their sculptured counterparts by Luca della Robbia, a temperamentally similar artist to whom Filippo Lippi owes a debt.The Coronation exhibits important innovations: the Baptist, gesturing toward the Virgin on the painting's central axis, introduces the spectator to the action. Behind him, still in the foreground, is the donor, while from below an angel enters the scene, a device that will find an echo later, in the art of Andrea Mantegna and in the frescoes of Domenico Ghirlandaio in the Sassetti Chapel of Santa Trinit&#224;. Little is left that specifically recalls Masaccio's solutions in these large paintings

25124-scene1.jpg	"This panel, the Gallery's Baptism of Christ, and several in other museums were part of an altarpiece illustrating the life of John the Baptist. It may have been commissioned for use in a baptistery.The various panels can be linked because the halos were decorated with the same metal punches and the backgrounds carved in the same brocade pattern. Such clues can often help identify paintings from a single workshop and to reconstruct works that have been dismantled and dispersed over time.Here we see a sequence of three separate events from the Baptist's infancy. First, two women admire the new infant, while a child peers in from the doorway. Next, John's father, Zacharias, writes ""his name is John"" on a scroll. While writing he regains the power of speech, which had been taken from him because he was skeptical of God's announcement that his elderly wife would conceive. One witness looks right, leading our eye to the third scene, where the infant John struggles while being circumcised.The panel's strong narrative sense and broad, simple figures reflect Giotto's influence. But its strongly contrasting colors and rich detail -- the patterned background, the heavy curtains, and architectural decoration -- express the younger artist's own preferences"

00575-023johne.jpg	The vault of the original choir (now transformed into the chapel named Capella di San Tarasio) of San Zaccaria, Venice, was painted when Castagno was about twenty-one, in 1442. The frescoes depicting God the Father, Saints and Evangelists are painted on narrow, sharply curved compartments between the ribs and consequently are particularly hard to photograph effectively. The style reflects a careful study by the young painter of Donatello's sculpture - especially the Zuccone and Jeremiah &#151; with its broad treatment of sturdy figures with puffy draperies, its intensity of expression, and even such secondary details as putti. Features from Uccello may also be detected, but the most important pictorial force acting upon Castagno seems to have been the example of Domenico Veneziano, whose participation in the same fresco program has been suggested

14988-2ponta03.jpg	"This imposing portrait of a seated cellist is one of the last of Gauguin's French works. It was painted in the first months of 1894. Its curious title, Upaupa Schneklud, inscribed on the canvas at top left, combines the sitter's surname with a reference to Gauguin's first Tahitian sojourn.The sitter is usually referred to as the Swedish cellist Fritz Schneklud. According to recent research, however, the cellist was Fr�deric-Guillaume Schneklud, a French born in Paris in 1859. His family of German origin emigrated to Paris from Poland.The slight resemblance of the cellist in the painting to Gauguin has led to some speculation that the painting might be a self-portrait. However, a recently discovered photograph of Schneklud leaves no doubt that the portrait is in fact quite accurate.As for the title, ""upaupa"" is a traditional local dance in Tahiti, which Gauguin enjoyed during his first stay there"

39296-4mark.jpg	"The picture was originally intended to be the left ""wing"" of a three-part cycle showing posthumous miracles of St Mark. The saint's soul has materialized in this painting top right, where St Mark is shown as a flying figure coming in haste to rescue a Saracen who has called on him in his hour of need, and conveying him to a lifeboat as a reward for his conversion. The symbol of the power of God's own aid symmetrically balances the figure of the saint, manifesting itself as a mysterious cloud in human form. The lower edge of the picture shows the donor Tommaso Rangone with his golden knightly robe flung back, helping another Muslim into the Christian boat.The figures form a diagonal which is continually broken to indicate the fury of the natural elements. The stormy sea and wind-tossed clouds evoke the meteorological conditions in a way which is almost over-dramatized. This is, however, a superb example of the visionary and fantastical style of Tintoretto, who uses light to convey the desired appearance of reality"

23979-sanluca2.jpg	"The work (12 panels) was commissioned in 1453, when the artist was twenty-two years old, for the chapel of S. Luca in the church of S. Giustina, Padua. The figures represented, reading from upper left, are: St Daniel of Padua, St Jerome, the Virgin, Christ, St John, St Augustine, St Sebastian, St Scolastica, St Prosdocimus, St Benedict and St Justina.The original wooden frame in which Mantegna's signature had been incised was destroyed by lightning in the seventeenth century. Its loss radically alters the composition, as can be seen by the considerable difference in scale between the two registers. It is thus worth attempting a reconstruction, in order to grasp the meaning of the whole work.Probably commissioned by the donors to execute a Gothic-type altarpiece, Mantegna must have succeeded in altering the scheme substantially by inserting a thick molding between the two orders. This division set the two ranges much farther apart than they are today. Another device used by the artist to avoid the effect of caged images is the perspective in the centre of the composition whereby the upper panels were made smaller to suggest distance while the lower panels were made larger to imply that they are closer to the spectator. But the most sensational means is the stepped pavement, which must have been the ground plane of the suggested architectural construction. The whole must have made a sort of two-storied loggia, housing figures engaged in a Sacra Conversazione.Even without its original framework, the separate figures remain highly impressive. A lyric quality, unequalled in Mantegna's other work, is generated by the illusionistic effect of the figures, achieved by means of their ""wet drapery,"" which Mantegna must have rediscovered by studying classic Roman sculpture"

19768-woodedlc.jpg	In the early seventeenth century the dominant trend in Dutch landscape painting was for harmonious and flat coastal scenes, exemplified by in the work of Jan van Goyen and Salomon van Ruysdael. In the second half of the century, however, there was a tendency to dramatize nature, as in the night scenes by Aert van der Neer and Jacob van Ruisdael's  romantically dramatic paintings of ruins, cascading waterfalls and stormy weather.Meyndert Hobbema was a pupil of Jacob van Ruisdael and followed the dramatic landscape tradition.

05198-10cana.jpg	The Marriage Feast at Cana was painted towards the end of Bosch's early period. The picture is not in good condition; the upper corners have been cut off, many heads have been repainted, and a pair of dogs at the lower left may have been added as late as the eighteenth century.The marriage banquet has been placed in a richly furnished interior, most probably a tavern. The miracle of the wine jars takes place at lower right; the guests are seated around an L-shaped table dominated at one end by the figure of Christ, behind whom hangs the brocaded cloth of honour usually reserved for the bride; he is flanked by two male donors in contemporary dress. Next to the Virgin at the centre of the table appear the solemn, austerely clad bridal couple; the bridegroom must be John the Evangelist, for his face closely resembles the type which Bosch employed elsewhere for this saint. Although the bridegroom remains nameless in the New Testament account, he was frequently identified as Christ's most beloved disciple.Christ and his friends are pensively absorbed in some inner vision, unaware of the evil enchantment which seems to have fallen upon the banquet hall. The other wedding guests drink or gossip, watched by the bagpiper who leers drunkenly from a platform at the upper left. On the columns flanking the rear portal, two sculptured demons have mysteriously come to life; one aims an arrow at the other who escapes by disappearing through a hole in the wall. From the left, two servants carry in a boar's head and a swan spitting fire from their mouths; an ancient emblem of Venus, the swan symbolized unchastity. This unholy revelry seems to be directed by the innkeeper or steward who stands with his baton in the rear chamber. On the sideboard next to him are displayed curiously formed vessels, some of which, like the pelican, are symbolic of Christ, while others possess less respectable connotations, such as the three naked dancers on the second shelf.The precise meaning of all these details remains unclear, as does that of the richly gowned child, his back turned to the viewer, who seems to toast the bridal couple with a chalice. However this may be, Bosch has undoubtedly employed the tavern setting as an image of evil, a comparison popular in medieval sermons, thereby contrasting the chaste marriage feast at Cana with the debauchery of the world.In its transformation of a biblical story, the Marriage Feast of Cana introduces us for the first time to the complexity of Bosch's thought. It presents, on the one hand, a moral allegory of man's pursuit of the flesh at the expense of his spiritual welfare, and on the other, the monastic ideal of a life secure from the world in contemplation of God. These two themes were to dominate almost all Bosch's later art

12532-04veneti.jpg	"The painting is poorly conserved. Almost all the final layers of colour are missing. The eyes have been restored. Because of the absence of the topmost layer of colour, the painting has acquired a soft chromatic shading. Even if we know that D�rer executed it during his second sojourn in Italy, probably in the autumn of 1506 after the Feast of the Rose Garlands, workmanship seems particularly ""Venetian."" The refinement of the artist is clearly absent in the sketching of the hair. Some object is discernible in the curl hanging to the left.Only a few traces of the hairnet have been preserved, and the sky blue of the background, which is inexplicably divided into two sections, is probably no longer its original shade. In its original state, however, this half-bust must have been in the Venetian style, because of her full, soft shapes, delicately modeled with a measured use of light. We must count this painting among the most beautiful works D�rer produced during his second sojourn in Venice.The various attempts to identify the model - for example, as Agnes D�rer, because of the letters AD on the trimming of the clothes or the woman with her head turned in the middle right of the Feast of the Rose Garlands - have not held up to criticism.

18751-guard217.jpg	This work is one of a series of twelve pictures representing the 'Solenit&#224; dogali', in which the artist has faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Canaletto and engraved by Giambattista Brustolon to commemorate the festivities at the coronation of the Doge Alviso IV Mocenigo, in 1763. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, though their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi. One of the pictures, bears the arms of Alviso IV Mocenigo.Two pictures in the series represent the Feast of the Bucentaur, the most sumptuous of all the Venetian festivals. It took place each year on Ascension Day, the anniversary of the setting out of Doge Pietro Orsolo's expedition, which had achieved the conquest of Dalmatia in about AD 1000. In a magnificent state barge, known as the Bucentaur, the Doge visited the Lido and celebrated the marriage of Venice with the Adriatic, by casting a ring into the sea. The canvas shows the Bucentaur leaving Venice; another in the series (in the Louvre) represents the Doge going to hear Mass at San Niccol&#242; del Lido.

42305-0901vela.jpg	One of the most famous of the paintings by Vel�zquez, and an example of his great mythological works, is The Fable of Arachne (Las Hilanderas), also known as The Tapestry Weavers or The Spinners. It was painted not for the king but for a private patron.The mythological story of the contest between the goddess Athena (Minerva to the Romans) and the mortal woman Arachne was perhaps told best by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses (Book VI). According to Ovid, Arachne lived in the country of Lydia (which had a legendary reputation for producing some of the most splendid textiles in the ancient world), where she matured into one of the finest weavers ever known. Arachne was in fact so adept at weaving that she became arrogant, and claimed that her ability rivaled that of the goddess Athena. Athena, as the patron deity of weavers and quite an accomplished weaver herself, immediately took notice of Arachne, and travelled to Lydia in order to confront the boastful woman. There the goddess assumed the guise of an old peasant, and gently warned Arachne not to compare her talents to those of an immortal; Arachne merely dismissed this reproach, and so Athena was compelled to accept the mortal woman's challenge.They would each compete by creating a tapestry. Athena wove her tapestry with images that foretold the fate of humans who compared themselves with deities, while Arachne's weaving told of the loves of the gods. Such was Arachne's skill that her work equalled that of the goddess, and Athena, overwhelmed by anger, struck the hapless woman repeatedly. Terrified, Arachne hung herself, but Athena transformed the woman into a spider who quickly scurried off. Thus, this tale explains the spider's ability to weave its web.In its composition, the artist looks back to his bodegones, where two different areas and two planes of reality balance each other. The everyday scene in the foreground shows a plainly furnished room where women are at work spinning. Sunlight falling in from above conjures up a complex range of colours. On the left, an elderly woman is at the spinning wheel, while the young woman seated to the right is winding yarn. One of the figures of naked youths by Michelangelo on the roof of the Sistine Chapel has been identified as the model for her attitude. Vel�zquez conveys their industry with brilliant immediacy, seeming to mingle the hum of their mills with the shifts of colour in the light. Three other women are bringing more wool and sorting through the remnants. The scene may reflect the disposition of the Royal Tapestry Factory of St Elizabeth in Madrid.There is a second room in the background, in an alcove reached by steps. It is flooded with light and contains several elegantly dressed women. The woman on the left wearing an antique helmet and with her arm raised is a figure of Athena. Opposite her - either really in the room, or part of the picture in the tapestry on the back wall? - stands the young Arachne, who has committed the sacrilegious act of comparing her skill in weaving with the goddess's. She has begun their competition with a tapestry showing one of the love affairs of Jupiter, the rape of Europa. Vel�zquez borrowed the theme of this tapestry from a famous picture by Titian, also extant in a copy by Rubens, to show his artistic veneration for the Venetian master.Around 1636 Rubens had painted a version of the same story for the Torre de la Parada, showing the punishment of Arachne, when she was turned into a spider. Vel�zquez omits this detail, instead treating the rivals almost as equals. By comparison with the weight of symbolism in the background scene, he shows the simple work of the women in the foreground with monumental dignity; it is the basis of the technique without which no goddess could practise her arts. This interpretation is still relevant if Vel�zquez has in fact represented the figures of Athena (now disguised, but with her shapely bare leg indicating her timeless beauty) and Arachne a second time in the figures of the old woman and the young woman in the foreground. Here, at least, Vel�zquez has transferred mythology to everyday reality. However, there is a whole series of possible meanings beneath the surface of this painting, and scholars are still puzzling over some of them to this day.The canvas was probably damaged by a fire in the Alc�zar (1734) and an upper section was added

42414-wrecked.jpg	This highly dramatic scene captures the struggle of two Dutch and one English ship in a howling gale as they battle to avoid a huge boulder and the shore itself. A powerful wind gusts from the left, knocking the Dutch ship Jupiter (far left) to a forty-five degree angle in the water as she attempts to claw off the land on the port tack. We see her almost full stern. Immediately in the centre is another Dutch ship, in greater difficulty still having lost her head and bowsprit in her collision with the rock. A lifeboat pulls out from the port quarter filled with sailors bound for the shore. Beyond it is an English ship, head to wind, presumably at anchor and drifting ashore.The painting depicts an actual event in 1653 during the first Anglo-Dutch War.

39477-3arsinoe.jpg	The Egyptian Princess Arsinoe is freed from her prison on Pharos to lead a rebellion against Caesar. Tintoretto moves the scene of the action from Alexandria to the Venetian lagoon, and lends satirical elements to this cloak-and-dagger story: the gondola in which the escape is made has a carved mask of a satyr at the bows, the noble knight is losing his balance as he indulges in a kiss that might be out of a movie. Tintoretto has replaced the rope mentioned in the textual source of the story by a rope ladder. As the small still-life of weapons in the gondola suggests, the knight has shot an arrow carrying a thin thread in through the tower window, so that Arsinoe and her companion could pull up the rope ladder fastened to the thread

The wily Juno talked her husband into giving her the fine-looking animal and had the hundred-eyed Argus guard it. Jupiter gave Mercury the task of killing the wicked guard. The inventive god approached the meadows and played songs on his pipe. The guard was charmed by the new and masterful melodies, and was lulled to sleep. Mercury beheads the sleeping guardian

37638-rebecca.jpg	Francesco Solimena was greatly admired by the Venetian painters of the eighteenth century, especially by Piazzetta and the young Giambattista Tiepolo, for his vigorous naturalism, marked by bold chiaroscuro contrasts and by rich, intense colours, which were the result of the influence on the Neapolitan artist by Mattia Preti.Amongst the very finest examples of this period of Solimena's career is the canvas Rebecca and Eleazar, painted around 1710, together with Jacob and Rachel, for the Baglioni family of Rio Marin, Venice. A light which seems to be like a sudden flash of lightning makes the figures stand out with plastic presence.

07958-farnes02.jpg	In 1597, Annibale Carracci received the commission from Cardinal Odoardo Farnese to paint the gallery situated at the rear of his palace, the Palazzo Farnese. This room had previously been an open loggia and now was to house part of the renowned Farnese statue collection. Further details regarding other functions of this room have not survived.Annibale had, to a large extent, free hand in the selection and distribution of the painted scenes. For the illusionistic architecture that subdivides the ceiling, Carracci turned to his  own works, executed together with his brother Agostino and cousin Lodovico, in the Palazzo Magnani, Bologna, as well as to Pellegrino Tibaldi's frescoes in the Palazzo Poggi. The frescoes are filled with quotations from and allusions to several works of art, among these are antique sculptures and reliefs from sarcophagi, and above all, the frescoes executed by Raphael and his pupils in the Villa Farnesina.Just as Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling marks the beginning of sixteenth century monumental Roman ceiling painting, the Galleria Farnese closes the century with a similarly magnificent ceiling decoration

19684-view_her.jpg	Jan van der Heyden, one of the leading architectural painters of this generation and a man of more parts than most Dutch painters, was born in 1637 at Gorinchem (Gorkum), a town near Dordrecht. When he was a boy of thirteen his parents settled in Amsterdam; apart from trips to the Rhineland, the northern, and the southern Netherlands he spent his life there. He painted some imaginary cityscapes based on studies done in Germany, which at first blush appear to be true-to-life views, and lovely capriccios which show expert knowledge of the principles of classical architecture. His oeuvre also includes about forty landscapes that reveal a debt to Adriaen van de Velde, who is credited with painting figures in some of his pictures, and a few intriguing still-lifes that can be justifiably categorized as interiors.Van der Heyden is best known for his views of Amsterdam. He took more than a pictorial interest in the city. In 1668 he presented Amsterdam's municipal authorities with a plan to light the entire city with glass lanterns and oil lamps he invented. Acceptance of his plan in 1669 to install more than 2,500 of his lamps made Amsterdam the first European city to enjoy street lighting. The city fathers also appointed him superintendent of municipal lighting at the handsome annual salary of 2,000 guilders per year for life. His lamps were soon installed in Berlin, Leipzig, and other cities - they even found their way to Japan. Those in Amsterdam continued to serve the city until 1840. His lamps also serve art historians today; when they appear in undated paintings by van der Heyden himself, Gerrit Berckheyde, Jacob van Ruisdael, and others, they establish 1669 as a terminus post quem for the work.Van der Heyden and his brother made an equally significant contribution to urban life in 1672 when they constructed an improved fire engine with pump-driven flexible coupled hoses, devices that replaced less efficient bucket brigades. Subsequently, Jan was appointed an overseer of Amsterdam's fire department and established a factory to manufacture the pump. In 1690 he and his son published their Description of the Newly Discovered and Patented Hose Fire Engine and Its Way of Extinguishing Fires. The book is richly illustrated with prints after van der Heyden's own drawings and he himself etched and engraved some of its plates. Van der Heyden's inventions and activities related to them made him a very wealthy man. After his death in 1712, the estate of his widow, who died in the same year, was valued at over 80,000 guilders. His estate also included more than seventy of his pictures and a sizeable library.Most of van der Heyden's paintings were done in the 1660s and 1670s - his work as inventor, entrepreneur, and city official probably slacked his pace. But he continued to paint until the very end. Van der Heyden always manages to achieve refinement without prettiness. He is an exquisite composer who keeps great structural clarity. While every brick in his numerous cityscapes is readable, the total impression still dominates through a broad as well as minute disposition of lights and darks, and atmosphere is felt as pervading the whole space and softening the exact definition. In his view of a great bend in the fashionable Herengracht (this picture) lined with huge lime trees that virtually hide the patrician houses that flank the broad canal he combines his gifts as city painter and landscapist, and captures an aspect of the Venice of the North that bewitched seventeenth-century visitors.As he frequently does, van der Heyden took liberties with the site. To emphasize the grand curve of the Herengracht he shortened the length of the embankment, thereby eliminating some houses, and he also exaggerated its upward sweep. By judicious selection and adjustment, and choosing unusual points of view, he gives a remarkable feel for the character and atmosphere of urban spaces as well as meticulous portraits of buildings

28710-madonna.jpg	"Signed and dated on the step: ""OPVS/BARTHOLOMEI/MONTA/GNA MCCCCLX- XXXVIIII."" The represented figures are Sts Andrew, Monica, Ursula, Sigismund and angel musicians. The large capitals in the background frieze are the initials of the Latin phrase meaning: ""Implore God's grace for us."" The medallion on the left portrays Matteo de' Pasti's profile plaque of Christ. Another Latin inscription on the step records a 1715 restoration, which does not seem to have much altered the painting. Preliminary drawings for this work are in the Uffizi and at Windsor Castle. Documented as having been in San Michele, Vicenza, it has been in the Brera since 1811.Trained in Venice, Bartolomeo interpreted the great Venetian models in an archaising vein, as did all the contemporary artists of the mainland. His prodigiously skillful draftsmanship defined lapidary forms that may be splintered or flaked but are always pure and as resonant as crystal. His strict sense of order is open, however, to an aristocratic feeling for nature, which is shown in pungently descriptive passages. In this altarpiece, the noble figures are displayed within a purely Lombard architectural setting. The composition is also architectonic, and its precedents go back through Antonello da Messina to Piero della Francesca, whose device of a pendant ostrich egg has been adopted here. The brown and silvery harmonies of the Lombard palette add a note of elegant austerity"
