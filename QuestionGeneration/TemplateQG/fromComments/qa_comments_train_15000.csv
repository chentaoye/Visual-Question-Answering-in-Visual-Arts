42543-04procu.jpg	Signature: Signed(?) and dated(?) lower right 1656.Provenance: Acquired for the collection of the elector of Saxony in 1741 from the Wallenstein collection. First mentioned in the Dresden catalog of 1765 as by Jean van der Meer, without specifying which Van der Meer. In the catalog of 1782 as by Van der Meer of Haarlem. In the catalog of 1826 as by Jacques van der Meer of Utrecht. First attributed to Jan van der Meer of Delft by Smith, and by Thorï¿½ in 1860. Both the signature and the date are old, but not necessarily contemporaneous.There is no relationship between this painting and other authentic works by the master, neither in the conception nor the execution. One has attempted to establish a connection between this work and the one by Dirck van Baburen from 1622, now in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. However, aside from the subject matter, the Dresden painting has nothing in common with the one in Boston. The latter seems to have been part of Vermeer van Delft's stock in trade and appears as such in two of his paintings. At one time, it must have been the property of his mother-in-law.The fact that Vermeer van Delft was a dealer and thus owned a number of works by other masters does not necessarily imply that he took them as models for his own productions; even if he used some of them as background decorations in his paintings.However, this painting is usually considered as a point of departure for an appraisal of Vermeer's achievement. There is very little indication of the interior and more action in it than there will be in the later paintings. The erotic subject, size and decorative splendour are all closely related to the Utrecht Caravaggisti painted a generation earlier. The chiaroscuro effect and the warm colour harmony of reds and yellows also indicate a connection with works painted in the early fifties by Rembrandt and his followers; perhaps Maes, who had settled in nearby Dordrecht by 1653, was the conduit

05236-03pcentr.jpg	Like the Tabletop of the Seven Deadly Sins, the Haywain shows mankind given over to sin, completely unmindful of God's law and oblivious to the fate which he has prepared for them. In this image, however, Bosch focuses on one of the Deadly Sins: the desire for worldly gain, or Avarice, whose sub-categories are elaborated in the adjacent figure groups very much as they are in the old handbooks on the Virtues and Vices. Avarice leads to discord, violence and even murder, all of which are graphically depicted in the open space before the cart. If the princes and prelates complacently jog along behind the cart, holding themselves aloof from this struggle, it is because the haystack is, so to speak, already in their possession; they are guilty of the sin of Pride. Avarice also leads men to cheat and deceive; the man wearing a tall hat and accompanied by a child at lower left is most likely a false beggar. The quack physician in the centre has set up his table with charts and jars designed to impress his victim; the purse at his side stuffed with hay alludes to his ill-gotten gains. Several nuns at lower right push hay into a large bag, supervised by a seated monk whose gluttonous tendencies are revealed by his ample waist.The meaning of some of the other groups remains unclear, and we may also wonder at the presence of the lovers on top of the haystack. That they illustrate the sin of Lust we know from the appearance of similar figures in the Prado Tabletop, but it might be argued that the pursuit of the pleasures of the flesh involves the expenditure rather than the accumulation of earthly goods. A class distinction may perhaps be observed between the rustic couple kissing in the bushes and the more elegantly dressed group making music. Their music is certainly that of the flesh, for the devil near by, piping some lascivious tune through his nose, has already lured their attention from the angel praying at the left

08478-mocking.jpg	Today Cavaliere d'Arpino's (Cesari's) Mocking of Christ is virtually forgotten, but in the mid-seventeenth century the biographer Giovanni Baglione considered it to be one of the artist's very finest pictures. Considering Cavaliere d'Arpino's tremendous output, this was not faint praise. When Baglione saw the painting, it was already in the sacristy of the church, where it had been bequeathed by Antonio della Valle along with three other pictures. Hung high on the wall then, as now, the figure of Christ has a commanding presence. A sharp, intense light falls across his powerfully modelled body, while his three tormentors are pushed into the dark recesses of the corners. Christ, suffering at the hands of three assailants who are given highly individual features, can be linked to a well-known iconographic tradition. In this case, however, the compression of the figures towards the picture plane creates a devotional image that evokes both torment and compassion without overt reference to time or space. The truthful descriptiveness of Christ's body superficially recalls the naturalism of Caravaggio, but Cavaliere d'Arpino's clarity of form and classic beauty is, in truth, more allied to the work of Annibale Carracci. In works such as The Mocking of Christ Cavaliere d'Arpino, like Annibale Carracci, moves the High Renaissance style of Raphael towards a baroque eloquence that will ultimately find its true fruition in Guido Reni

The event depicted in this panel took place on 22 May 1450, a week after Saint Bernardino's canonization by order of Pope Nicholas V. It shows the paralytic donna Perna, wife of the Aquilean Matteo Petrucci, being cured after approaching the corpse of Saint Bernardino: his body was removed from its coffin by the people of Aquila and displayed in the church for veneration almost exactly six years after the saint's death in the Franciscan convent of Aquila on 20 May 1444

22500-5magi.jpg	This painting was commissioned to replace Leonardo's picture of the same subject, after Leonardo had moved from Florence to Milan. Given the built-in element of competition, it is legitimate to ask whether Filippino was up to the task. Because Leonardo's Adoration of the Magi was some fifteen years earlier and never completed, a comparison is not altogether fair. Lippi's highly effective picture is full of incidents, although the end result could be considered excessive in detail.One of the interesting things about this composition, jammed with figures, is identifying the characters. Critics claim to have identified Pier Francesco Medici the Elder, as well as his two sons Lorenzo il Popolano and Giovanni il Popolano (father of the famous condottiere Giovanni dalle Bande Nere), and Piero il Pugliese.The work shows traces of influence of North European painting, which had come to Florence with the Portinari Triptych by Hugo van der Goes, while the figures grouped excitedly around the central nucleus are already sixteenth century and are derived directly from Leonardo da Vinci.Filippino draws inspiration here from two other well-known Adorations of an earlier date, those of Sandro Botticelli and Leonardo, both by portraying the crowds that closes in around the divine group, and by including the young man with a characteristic tuft of hair on the right

02488-1seaso2.jpg	The painting is part of a cycle dedicated to the four seasons. Each one is symbolically represented by a startling and evocative juxtaposition of fruits and objects typical of that time of the year. Arcimboldo found this subject particularly congenial and often painted groups of pictures on a theme. Not only did he paint the four seasons, but also the four elements (Earth, Air, Water, and Fire).The painting originally belonged to a series of the Four Seasons. Summer, the only dated picture of the series, carries the date 1563. For the first time, Arcimboldo composes heads from all kinds of objects, whose selection gives meaning to the allegory. As attested by among others, a maiolica plate from 1536, this compositional method was certainly not invented by Arcimboldo, but the sophistication and imagination with which the painter applies the themes in the picture-puzzles are a very personal achievement, and the many later copies serve to reveal in their weaknesses and simplifications Arcimboldo's true originality.In the profile bust of Summer, the cheek and neck area are composed of a large peach, quince, garlic, white young onions, yellow beets and white eggplant; the mouth and lips are formed of cherries and the open peapod within imitates a row of teeth. The nose is a young wild cucumber and the chin is a pear; the eye shines as a glassy sour cherry between two small pears. The bulge of the forehead seems to be made of brown-skinned onions; even the eyebrows - a curved grain-ear - are not overlooked. On the temple are three hazelnuts in their covers, and in the place of the ear is a dried corncob. The ensemble is completed with a head covering, effectively a cap or a hat made of fruit and vegetables bedded in greenery, from which emerge oat spikes resembling a hat feather. The clothing in woven straw has a single artichoke and the woven signature and date sophisticatedly integrated into the composition as jewellery.

22945-10sooths.jpg	After several unfortunate attempts at historical paintings Pietro Falca, known as Pietro Longhi, turned, on his return from a stay in Bologna where he had particularly admired the popular art of Giuseppe Maria Crespi, to the depicting of Venetian society at the moment of its decline offering a witty view, with just a hint of irony, in which not even the smallest detail that can lend colour is neglected. Though the paintings look similar, they in fact offer an extremely wide range of subtly described and individualized personalities and moods of the characters engaged in often frivolous pursuits under the gaze, alternately ironic and ambiguous, of servants who rarely betray any sympathy or liking for their masters and mistresses. In the minute detail of his sharp reporting Pietro Longhi sees his age with a spirit of good-humoured optimism untinged by social and moral jjudgments. His art shows a close affinity with the work of Carlo Goldoni, a connection that was several times acknowledged by the great playwright himself

04570-jerome.jpg	"This painting is attributed to the problematic French painter Trophime Bigot. Documented as active in Rome from 1620 to 1634, Bigot is mentioned by Sandrart as a painter of nocturnal pictures of half figures. A series of candlelit paintings now attributed to him were formerly given to the ""Candlelight Master"". Once considered to all be by the same hand, the paintings in that group have now been separated into three different sets. The first and most consistent of these retains the name of the Candlelight Master, who has been identified as Bigot. The second set is attributed to a ""Maestro Jacopo"", author of a Piet&#224; in the Passion Chapel of the church of Santa Maria in Aquiro. The remaining pictures of this group form a third, more diverse set that is attributed to the circle of Bigot. On the basis of convincing similarities with other confirmed works, most importantly the Crowning of Christ with the Crown of Thorns from Santa Maria in Aquiro, the National Gallery Saint Jerome has been placed in the category of original works by Bigot. The picture also has a pendant depicting Jerome's fellow-penitent St. Mary Magdalene, now in the Museum of Art at Ponce.The distinctive effect of the candlelight visible in the Jerome, light that obliterates many of the details of the saint's anatomy, is typical of the works of Bigot.According to a recent proposal, the candlelight is a symbolic visualization of the ""Lux Intellecti"", a metaphor for Divine Grace discussed by Saint Augustine"

04105-herdsmen.jpg	The landscape Herdsmen and Herds at a Waterfall was painted in the 1660s, during a phase of the artist's production which occurred long after any Italian journey. The work shows a rocky valley with a mountain river running through it whose source appears to be the waterfall in the distance. The steep wooded riverbank to the left faces a craggy cliff face on the other side. A couple of goatherds rest on the rocky plateau below, while a larger herd of cattle is being driven off to the right. A narrow path on the far right leads down to the water. A number of other sheep and cattle are being driven along this bank, to cross the river at a shallow spot. The eye moves from the lower edge of the picture up the valley and into the distance, towards sunny mountain uplands. The very painterly emphasis on individual motifs in the foreground, such as the naked branch lying partly in the water, the vegetation on the bank, and the trunks of the large trees, partly denuded of their bark, is characteristic of Berchem's style from around 1660 onwards. The bright light in the foreground and the bold shadows it casts make the details of the vegetation and rocky landscape stand out clearly. By contrast, the middleground and background are bathed in a soft, diffuse light and seem to swim before our eyes. The use of harsh light and the sharpness of the contours of the individual motifs reveal the influence of Adam Pynacker on Berchem's later work. This painting, in an unusually large format for Berchem, can be regarded as a typical example of this influence

28792-martyrdo.jpg	"Considered a rare oddity by contemporaries, this painting by ""three hands"" (Morazzone, Giovan Battista Crespi and Giulio Cesare Procaccini) recalls the competitions that were common in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, in which painters vied to outdo one another in rendering the same subject. Here, however, the three artists collaborated on a single picture. Similar outlooks and experiences created a common bond, a sort of ""family resemblance"" among the three, so that stylistically the painting has unity, despite variations and differences.The compositional structure of the work, probably conceived by Morazzone, pivots the central figure of the executioner. On the left there is Cerano's flashingly lighted horse and rider, the horse sumptuously dappled in black and white, vaguely recalling Van Dyck. Cerano's typical spiraling forms are seen in the cupid with the dog and the decapitated saint. In his broken line and repeating contours, as well as in the ""marbled"" effect not only of the drapery but also of the flesh, he shows unmistakably greater maturity and feeling than is to be found in Morazzone's warm theatricality or in Procaccini's softly pleasing effects.In the centre, Morazzone's executioner, with his tensely elongated trunk and arms, recalls similar figures by the artist in the seventh chapel at the Sacro Monte, Varese. Also attributable to Morazzone is the angel bearing the palm of martyrdom, disposed along a diagonal paralleling the executioner's arm, and the luminous freely rendered heads in the background. Procaccini was responsible for the figure of the saint, languidly waiting for the blow to fall, and the attendant angel who comforts her and points to heaven"

19763-watermil.jpg	Hobbema was a pupil of Jacob van Ruisdael and together with him was one of the most important of the realist landscape painters. His work reveals his debt to his master, whom he followed closely in his early works to the point that many of them are impossible to distinguish from those by Ruisdael. Little by little, however, he developed his own style. His paintings depict local scenes in which the vegetation is less dense than in Ruisdael's compositions, and, generally speaking, his landscapes lack the romantic tone which characterized his master's works. The mood of Hobbema's landscapes is usually one of calm. Hobbema was especially admired by 17th- and 18th-century English collectors, and his work consequently exercised an important influence on British landscape painting

29275-208muril.jpg	"Murillo finished the paintings commissioned for Santa Marï¿½a Blanca in Seville in 1665. The commission consisted of four paintings, two in the arched spaces  beneath the small dome of the nave and two more in the same format  placed at the head of the aisles. The nave paintings represent the pious legend of the founding of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, the mother church of Santa Marï¿½a Blanca. According to this story, a Roman patrician, John, and his wife had pledged their wealth to the Virgin. She rewarded their piety by appearing in a dream and instructed them to build a church in her name on the Esquiline Hill, in accordance with a plan that would be traced on the surface of a miraculous summertime snowfall. The couple rushed to report their vision to Pope Liberius (352-366), who had also been visited by the Virgin, and all proceeded to the designated place, where they witnessed the miraculous fall of snow. Following the heaven-sent plan, they built the church and named it Santa Maria della Neve, the Italian word for ""snow,"" which coincides with the name of the Sevillian canon, Justino de Neve (1625-1685), who was one of Murillo's principal patrons and who commissioned the redecoration of the Santa Marï¿½a Blanca, originally a synagogue and later converted into a church.In the two lunettes dedicated to this story (Dream of Patrician John and Patrician John Reveals his Dream to Pope Liberius, both in the Prado, Madrid), Murillo intensified the sketchy, sfumato technique first used in the Birth of the Virgin (Louvre, Paris). The consonance between the gentle narrative and the warm, intimate style seems effortless, so much so that it is easy to overlook the confident artistry of the complicated poses and the dextrous brushwork in the background"

05316-10centre.jpg	The central panel of the Triptych represents the Adoration of the Magi. Several copies of the panel exist in various museums (Philadelphia, Amsterdam, Bonn, Avignon etc.).The panel displays the adoration of the Christ Child by the three Kings or Magi. The Infant Christ sits solemnly enthroned on his mother's lap. The Virgin and Child resemble a cult statue beneath its baldachin, and the Magi approach with all the gravity of priests in a religious ceremony. The splendid crimson mantle of the kneeling King echoes the monumental figure of the Virgin. That Bosch intended to show a parallel between the homage of the Magi and the celebration of the Mass is clearly indicated by the gift which the oldest King has placed at the feet of the Virgin: it is a small sculptured image of the Sacrifice of Isaac, a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice on the Cross. Other Old Testament episodes appear on the elaborate collar of the second King, representing the visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, and on the Moorish King's silver orb, depicting Abner offering homage to David.A group of peasants have gathered around the stable at the right. They peer from behind the wall with lively curiosity and scramble up to the roof in order to get a better view of the exotic strangers. The Shepherds had seen Christ on Christmas Eve, but they frequently reappear as spectators in fifteenth-century Epiphany scenes. Generally, however, they display much more reverence than do Bosch's peasants, whose boisterous behaviour contrasts strongly with the dignified bearing of the Magi.The most curious detail of Bosch's Epiphany is the man standing just inside the stable behind the Magi. Naked except for a thin shirt and a crimson robe gathered around his loins, he wears a bulbous crown; a gold bracelet encircles one arm, and a transparent cylinder covers a sore on his ankle. He regards the Christ Child with an ambiguous smile, but the faces of several of his companions appear distinctly hostile.Because they stand within the dilapidated stable, time-honoured symbol of the Synagogue, these grotesque figures have been identified as Herod and his spies, or Antichrist and his counsellors. Although neither identification is quite convincing, the association of the chief figure with the powers of darkness is clearly suggested by the demons embroidered on the strip of cloth hanging between his legs. A row of similar forms can be seen on the large object which he holds in one hand; surprisingly, this can only be the helmet of the second King, and still other monsters decorate the robes of the Moorish King and his servant. These demonic elements undoubtedly refer to the pagan past of the Magi.Behind the stable in the centre, the followers of two of the Magi rush towards each other like opposing armies; the host of the third King appears beyond the sand dunes. The gently rolling countryside contains, in addition, an abandoned tavern and a pagan idol. Even the distant grey-blue walls of Jerusalem, one of Bosch's most evocative renderings of the Holy City, appear vaguely sinister

03248-stillife.jpg	Francisco Barrera became an important figure in the artistic community in Madrid during the 1630s and 1640s, when he took over leadership of the painters' guild. However, he remained a relatively undistinguished master in the panorama of painting at the Spanish court. Like many other painters of limited talents, Barrera was an all-rounder whose production centred on religious subjects, images of saints, landscapes and still-lifes. Like Juan de Arellano, Barrera worked for the open market and sold his paintings from a shop in the centre of Madrid. The rise in popularity of still-life and flower paintings among collectors in Madrid during the middle years of the century doubtlessly encouraged Barrera to turn to this genre. Although his religious paintings are unknown today, his still-life paintings show that he developed a distinct personality in paintings of this type.This painting represents lilies and carnations in an oriental-style vase, the freshness of the lilies denoted by the fact that only five of the blooms have opened. Alongside these, there is a plate of cherries and apricots, that are kept cool by pieces of snow from the wine cooler. The representation on the vase of a monkey picking fruit whimsically relates this object to the fruit collected in the bowl in the picture. A jug of water is placed in the background and in the foreground a pie rests on a napkin, with a knife.The painting typifies Barrera's style in still-life and flower painting. He has sharply defined the forms and details of the flowers, and a certain hardness in their facture reflects the influence of the flower paintings of Juan van der Hamen and Antonio Ponce, the latter working with Barrera on decorative painting projects at the Buen Retiro in the 1630s.

30400-convex.jpg	"Giorgio Vasari wrote in his Lives of the Artists on the nineteen years old Parmigianino:""Then came upon him the desire to see Rome, hearing men greatly praise the works of the masters there, especially of Raffaello and Michael Angelo, and he told his desire to his old uncles. They, seeing nothing in the desire that was not praiseworthy, agreed, but said that it would be well to take something with him which would gain him an introduction to artists. And the counsel seeming good to Francesco, he painted three pictures, two small and one very large. Besides these, inquiring one day into the subtleties of art, he began to draw himself as he appeared in a barber's convex glass. He had a ball of wood made at a turner's and divided in half, and on this he set himself to paint all that he saw in the glass, and because the mirror enlarged everything that was near and diminished what was distant, he painted the hand a little large. Francesco himself, being of very beautiful countenance and more like an angel than a man, his portrait on the ball seemed a thing divine, and the work altogether was a happy success, having all the lustre of the glass, with every reflection and the light and shade so true, that nothing more could be hoped for from the human intellect.The picture being finished and packed, together with the portrait, he set out, accompanied by one of his uncles, for Rome; and as soon as the Chancellor of the Pope had seen the pictures, he introduced the youth and his uncle to Pope Clement, who seeing the works produced and Francesco so young, was astonished, and all his court with him. And his Holiness gave him the charge of painting the Pope's hall.""The painting was given to Pope Clement VII as a gift by the young artist"

37262-80fire.jpg	In the scene next to the right bay Simone has painted the Miracle of Fire, a fresco which, like the scene of the resurrected boy, is very badly damaged. The scene illustrates the event immediately after the miracle, when a tongue of flame burst down from Emperor Valentinian's throne after he had refused to grant audience to the Saint. The sovereign, more 14th-century than his colleague Julian, is shown stretching out towards Martin, as though about to embrace him. The figure at the far left is very natural, covering his mouth with his hand in astonishment. The scene is composed of several different architectural structures, including a variety of arches: pointed arches, round arches, four-centred arches. The two-light mullioned windows also appear in two versions: the ogival Gothic variety and the more typically Romanesque. The pilasters, battlements and loggias create an effect of movement and dynamism

23764-calvary.jpg	A series of scenes make up this picture, all of them painted against a gold background. Although the crucified Christ has been placed in the centre of the composition, the chief subject is St Denis, the first Bishop of Paris and patron saint of France. The court painter of Dijon has painted the scene of his last Communion and his martyrdom in 285, in the company of the deacon Eleutherius and the priest Rusticus. On the left of the crucifix the Bishop, seen behind the bars of a blue prison with a superstructure of red bricks, receives the Host from the haloed figure of Christ in a gold brocade robe and blue mantle, accompanied by angels. On the right, the burly executioner, dressed in green, is beheading the holy Bishop, whose head is half severed from the body. As against the formal representation of Christ and the saints, the faces of the crowd watching the event are markedly individual; especially noteworthy are the bearded figure in a red robe and the man wearing a white turban. The lively group balancing the mass of the prison, the open spaces of the middle distance all go to make up a superb example of French moderation and proportion.It has been suggested that this painting was begun by Jean Malouel and completed by Henri Bellechose

24545-16olona.jpg	The scenes depicted on the south wall of the Baptistery are the following: the Feast of Herod (left), Salome Bringing the Head of the Baptist to Herodias (right), and the Burial of the Baptist (in the background.In the scene of the feast, we see nothing of Salome's veil dance, but rather the moment just after it, when she asks for the head of the Baptist. The three men seated at the table with the king appear dubious, obviously disapproving of her request. The motif of the putti holding garlands in the frieze of the loggia in which the banquet takes place had been introduced into Tuscan sculpture by Jacopo della Quercia at the beginning of the fifteenth century at the tomb of Ilaria del Caretto.The next scene appears in the right-hand portion of the same picture space.

30363-polyptic.jpg	The development of the art of Paolo Veneziano is characterized by a kind of see-sawing supremacy of one or the other of two influences: on the one hand, the advances being made in contemporary Italian painting and on the other the traditions of oriental figurative art. In this polyptych, set in the sumptuousness of its magnificent International Gothic wooden frame each of the novelties of western art tends to find its expression within the Byzantine modes typical of Byzantine art at the time of the Palaeologus dynasty.Physical and spiritual centre of the complex iconographical scheme is the 'Coronation of the Virgin', surrounded by eight stories from the life of Christ. On the left are 'The Adoration of the Magi', 'The Baptism of Christ', 'The Last Supper' and 'The Prayer in the Garden and the Arrest of Christ'; on the right are 'The Journey to Calvary', 'The Crucifixion', 'The Resurrection and the encounter with Mary Magdalene' and 'The Ascension'. In the second order, set between the four Evangelists, are scenes depicting, from left to right: 'Pentecost', 'St. Clare taking the Veil', 'St. Francis handing back his clothes to his father', 'The Stigmata of St. Francis', 'The Death of St. Francis' and 'Christ in Judgment'.The contrast of the Gothic inventiveness of the figures and the planimetric effects of the gilded background of the panels with the 'Coronation of the Virgin' is even more noticeable in many of the lesser scenes such as 'The Adoration of the Magi' and 'The Baptism of Christ' which are clearly reminiscent of Byzantine treatments of the same subjects. The influence of the West on the other hand, is suggested by the lively handling of the compositional rhythms in other stories from the life of Christ such as 'The Prayer in the Garden and the Arrest of Christ' and 'The Crucifixion'

40368-1battle.jpg	"The three paintings of the Battle of San Romano are universally attributed to Paolo Uccello. The three scenes are: Niccol&#242; da Tolentino Leads the Florentine Troops, London, National Gallery; Bernardino della Ciarda Thrown Off His Horse, Florence, Uffizi; Micheletto da Cotignola Engages in Battle, Paris, Louvre. Together with the stories from the life of Noah these are undoubtedly Uccello's most famous works.In all three the battle scene is interpreted in terms of a chaotic melee of horsemen, lances and horses in a desperate struggle, portrayed through an endless series of superimposed and intersecting perspective planes. As in the stories from the life of Noah in Santa Maria Novella, here too the movement which should animate the scenes appears to be frozen, as it were, by the isolation of the individual details, all realistically portrayed. See, for instance, the elaborate heavy armour, the leather saddles, the gilded studs, the horses' shiny coats, and of course the splendid ""mazzocchi', the huge multifaceted headgear that Uccello often included in his pictyres due to the specific difficulty of painting it in proper perspective"

24784-0merode1.jpg	This intimate triptych, which dates from about 1425, is traditionally known as the Mï¿½rode Altarpiece, after the family that owned it during the nineteenth century. It illustrates the moment when the archangel Gabriel announces to the Virgin Mary that she has been chosen by God to be the mother of Christ. The patrons of the painting gaze upon this miraculous event from one of the side panels, while Joseph, busy at his carpenter's bench, occupies the other wing. Campin's fascination with the natural and domestic world dominates his telling of the sacred story. He meticulously renders even the smallest details in an innovative technique combining translucent oil overlay on water-based opaque pigments. The resulting optical effects enhance Campin's interpretation of the Virgin's private chamber as an affluent fifteenth century interior filled with household appointments and goods similar to those that the patron would have known. Yet Campin was essentially guided in his choice of objects by the symbolic needs of the story. The brass laver, for example, signifies Mary's purity, as does the Madonna lily in the maiolica pitcher. As an object of private devotion, this painting would have been integrated into the furnishings of the owners' private quarters, where its hinged wings could be opened and closed according to the daily cadence of private prayers or following the traditions of the Christian calendar

15327-colonna1.jpg	The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).The most important room in the palace is the gallery (Grande Galleria) on the second floor of the south wing. It is more than a story and a half in height, and it receives light from both sides. It has two separate anterooms, marked off from the main space by pairs of columns. These extensions and the wall arrangements of the room with large pilasters produced the most magnificent secular space from the Roman Baroque.The painting of the gallery was begun in 1665 and lasted until 1685. The pictorial program unfolds in the vaults of the trio of rooms and it is supplemented to this day with the original statues, paintings, and elaborate furnishings. The architecture painting and framing is by Johann Paul Schor and his workshop, the narrative cycle on Marcantonio II Colonna is by Giovanni Coli and Filippo Gherardi, two painters from Lucca working as an inseparable team. The scenes on the ceiling illustrate decisive events from the military career of Marcantonio II Colonna (1535-1584). In its form and composition the narrative cycle borrows from sixteenth-century Venetian painting, which beginning with Veronese had specialised in depictions on ceilings of historical events viewed from extremely low vantage points

Maria in Campomorto at Siziano (Pavia) to steal the holy vessels used for mass. They were seen off by skeletons which issued from the graves in the surrounding cemetery. The macabre scene is a large votive piece. The events are watched by the Virgin who we see in the top right-hand corner organizing the skeletons' sortie and decreeing the punishment for the thieves, who were subsequently hanged.

37920-rhetori.jpg	"Various of Jan Steen's works contain direct and indirect references to chambers of rhetoric, the lively societies where artisans, traders, academics and artists met to organise various literary and theatrical activities. Between the late 15th century and the end of the 17th century they were to provide the bridge between medieval passion plays and the professional, elite theatre and opera which developed from then on. Even so Jan Steen, unlike many of his painter contemporaries, never belonged to a chamber and we cannot assess unambiguously from his work how he judged this socio-cultural phenomenon. Nor does this painting, produced around 1665/68, and very important for its documentary value alone, offer any definitive answer. It is true that the artist portrays himself here as a highly amused spectator among the audience that is paying its respects in the door of an inn where a ""declamator"", the speaker of the society, is reading a text. In so doing he appears to declare himself a sympathiser. In the meantime the goings-on inside the same inn would tend to confirm the rhetoricians' reputation as liking their liquor. Given that, in the mid-17th century, it was ""bon ton"" amongst a certain social class to dismiss rhetoricians as literary dimwits, bickerers and incorrigible revellers, we are again all of a sudden uncertain on whose side the artist in fact was.Almost all the figures and physical signs identifying a rhetorical chamber as such can be found in the painting: apart from the declamator, announcing his performance with the large drum, we can suppose the serious-looking man behind him to be the ""factor"" or poet. The ""emperor"" or ""prince"", the flagbearer and the fool are recognisable by the respective attributes: a crown, a flag and a dunce's cap with a cock's feather. A crock and a drinking beaker hang outside the open door, which is partly shaded off by a carpet, an essential item of dï¿½cor during performances. A quatrain, attached to a wreath of flowers, announces the philosophy of life of the happy band. Until now it has not been possible to establish which society carried the motto ""In liefde vrij "" (Free in love) in its blazon, the traditional diamond-shaped shield hanging on the wall."

35816-v_lower.jpg	The main line of eighteenth-century Dutch still-life painting is represented by the Amsterdamers Rachel Ruysch and Jan van Huysum, who both specialized in elaborate flower and fruit pictures. They were the most popular still-life painters of the period; their works commanded high prices and were found in famous collections throughout Europe, and their colourful paintings still have wide appeal. The status they were accorded in their time indicates there were powerful patrons and collectors who took exception to the teachings of academic theorists who minimized the significance of still-lifes by placing them at the lower end of the hierarchy of kinds of painting.In the hands of Rachel Ruysch and Jan van Huysum Dutch flower pieces brighten up again. Their technical perfection and love of minute detail recall the still-lifes painted a century earlier by Bosschaert and his followers, and like their predecessors they did not hesitate to include flowers of different seasons in their arrangements. However, neither Ruysch nor van Huysum arranges blooms into evenly lit symmetrical bunches in the way that early-seventeenth-century painters did, and their lively chiaroscuro effects and delightful ornateness show an unmistakable affinity with Late Baroque and Rococo art.

They attended the school of Lï¿½on Bonnat, or the Acadï¿½mie Julian, or the Acadï¿½mie Colarossi. Some of them were tutored by  Jean-Lï¿½on Gï¿½rï¿½me. When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Grï¿½z-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods.In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark. Many Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish artists returned there every summer, to paint in the fine northern light in the company of friends old and new.Anna Ancher was a mistress of interior light and colour. She generally used her effects to establish a quiet, contemplative mood. The sensitivity and gifted colourism of her paintings created soulful, intimate atmospheres. In the present canvas, she uses the contrast of sunlight and the silhouettes of potted plants and window crossbars on the wall and floor. Her colour scheme is based on the contrasting blue of the wall and upholstery and the yellow of the curtains, an effect that is replicated in the blue smock and blonde hair of the girl sitting by the window

19225-83slouch.jpg	This portrait of an unknown gentleman is one of the artist's last works. Emphatically casual, his hat aslant on his head, the man turns towards us on his chair, a smile on his lips, his eyes gleaming with mischief. There is no sense here of a model holding a pose. The rapid, sketchy manner of painting reinforces the impression of a fleeting moment captured in great haste, and foreshadows the Impressionism of the late nineteenth-century.

42286-0704vela.jpg	It was customary at the courts of Europe during the seventeenth century for monarchs to keep dwarfs. Velï¿½zquez's sympathy for the fools and dwarfs of the Spanish court is obvious: in the pathos and humane understanding demonstrated by the single portraits with which he (and he alone) paid tribute to them.A particularly impressive portrait is Velï¿½zquez's painting of the dwarf Don Diego de Acedo, alias El Primo (The Cousin), probably commissioned by the court and executed at Fraga in about 1644. (The dwarf was called El Primo because he boasted of being the relative of Velï¿½zquez.)Like the midget Sebastian de Morra, who served in the retinue of the Infante Don Fernando and Prince Baltasar Carlos, El Primo is shown sitting, and is viewed slightly from below. The effect of presenting them from this dignified aspect is to raise their status in the eyes of the spectator. El Primo is portrayed leafing through the pages of an enormous tome. His small size makes the books surrounding him appear even more gigantic than they are. His occupation here is undoubtedly a reference to his administrative duties at the court. At the same time, it is probably an example of humanist satirical jest, which would often decry the senseless writing and reading of books as a contemptible vice. Contemporary spectators would never have accepted that a dwarf knew how to use the attributes of a scholar; the artist thus seems to be using an apparently grotesque discrepancy to poke fun at the pseudo-scholars of his day

36901-c_virgin.jpg	This is one of the greatest, most unusual and uncomfortably intense masterpieces produced in Italy during the seventeenth century. The altarpiece is one of only a handful of certain attributions from which we can reconstruct the unhappy career of Serodine. In the canvas for his parish church he structured the scene into two layers. At the top of the picture, there is a blurred vision of the coronation of the Virgin. Below, we see the motionless face of Christ on a cloth around which cluster six ragged saints, whom Serodine treats with even greater harshness and directness than ever seen in Caravaggio

05262-18mocked.jpg	Bosch painted a group of half-length Passion scenes. The earliest example most probably is the Christ Crowned with Thorns in London. The large, firmly modelled figures are composed against the plain, grey-blue background with the utmost simplicity, the white-robed Christ surrounded by his four tormentors. One soldier holds a crown of thorns above his head, another tugs at his robe, and a third touches his hand with a mocking gesture. Their actions, however, seem curiously ineffectual and Christ ignores his persecutors to look calmly, even gently, at the spectator.The half-length format and the tendency to crowd the figures against the picture plane with little indication of space, are characteristics which reflect a Flemish devotional type popularized by Hugo van der Goes and Hans Memling. Like its Flemish models, the London Christ Crowned with Thorns presents the sacred scene not in its historical actuality but in its timeless aspect

17514-2luke1.jpg	The scene was a favourite subject of the late Gothic German and Netherlandish masters. This painting, one of the greatest by Gossart, is a departure from traditional Netherlandish representation of the subject. It was inspired by Italian art and reformulated in Gossart's manner. The setting is a Renaissance hall decorated with grotesque pilasters bearing classical medallions copied from Roman coinage. In the background there is a tempietto adorned with the statue of Moses. St Luke, kneeling at a prie-dieu, makes a metalpoint drawing of the Virgin, appearing in a vision before him. He is guided by the hand of an angel.A number of Italian sources have been suggested in the literature as possible prototypes, including Raphael's Tempi Madonna, Fra Bartolomeo's Vision of St Bernard, and Filippino Lippi's Annunciation.Gossart painted two versions of the subject, this is the later one, the first is in Prague. A remarkable innovation of the second version is that the Madonna is not a sitter of the portrait painting, she appears as a vision of St Luke

00890-2scenes.jpg	"Fra Angelico was entrusted with a number of commissions for the Vatican Palace. The one that involved the most work was the decoration of the small room in the ancient tower of Pope Innocent III that Nicholas V turned into his private chapel, a rectangular space with a groin vault. The floor installed at this time survives. It displays the emblem of Nicholas V, a radiant sun. The frescoes show scenes from the lives of Sts Stephen and Lawrence, in two horizontal bands. On the rear wall was a Deposition, also by Fra Angelico and mentioned by Vasari, but now lost. On the arches are the eight Doctors of the Church in Gothic aedicules. The Evangelists are on the vault, while on the window jambs rosettes with the head of Christ alternate with heads of patriarchs and prophets.The cycle is generally attributed to Fra Angelico and his workshop. The hand of Benozzo Gozzoli has been identified in some of the scenes from the life of St Stephen. Painted for the jubilee of 1450, the cycle clearly reveals the program pursued by Nicholas V of a link between Christian and classical culture. Fra Angelico's figures have a ""Roman"" appearance: they stand solemn and serious, like heroes from antiquity, against a background of theatrical architecture, reminding the beholder of the buildings of ancient Rome. The intention was to underline the continuity between imperial and Christian Rome which the pope wished to assert"

In accordance with an old and widespread custom that still survives in many places, a bean was baked into a cake and the person who found it in their portion was given a paper crown and made king for the night, with the power to appoint companions to various positions, such as that of court jester.

41959-2allegor.jpg	Valdï¿½s Leal's two relentlessly gruesome paintings are located just inside the entrance of the chapel of the Hospital de la Caridad in Seville. The first, entitled In Ictu Oculi (In the twinkling of an Eye), is a highly charged representation of the futility of worldly goals and pursuits. The path of glory lead but to the grave, which is unflinchingly rendered in the companion picture, Finis Gloriae Mundi (The End of Worldly Glory), where vile bugs feast on the rotting remnants of human flesh. Here the choice of salvation or damnation is graphically offered in the scale that appears above the corpses: nothing more (ni mas) than worldly pursuits is needed for perdition. On the other side of the balance are instruments of prayer and penance: nothing less (ni menos) is needed to save the soul. However, the scale is in equilibrium and the additional weight for salvation can only be provided by performing the acts of mercy represented in the clear light of the chapel

15195-selfport.jpg	The painting is signed on the table in the centre: A.G.F.Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of Orazio, was born in Rome. The chief formative influence on the style of her painting was her father, but after his departure for England in 1626 the only direct contact that she had with him was the few years she spent in London (1638-1641). Artemisia Gentileschi worked for long periods in Florence, Rome and Naples, as well as in Genoa and Venice. The style of Caravaggio with its emphasis on rich colouring and strong contrasts of light and shadow was deeply influential, but to this must be added knowledge of the work of Northern European artists active in Italy, and of regional differences in Italian art. While in London it is likely that Artemisia assisted her father just before his death with the painting of the Allegory of Peace and the Arts under the English Crown for the ceiling of The Queen's House at Greenwich (now in Marlborough House, London).It is evident that Charles I owned at least three paintings by her. The present work was sold after the execution of the king in 1649, but was recovered at the time of the Restoration. Yet it would appear that Charles I did not commission the Allegory of Painting directly from the artist.The identification of the figure is confirmed by a contemporary medal of the artist and by a print by Jerome David. The mode of the portrait, however, is allegorical and accords with the description of the personification of 'Painting' given in the Iconologia of Cesare Ripa (1611), where mention is made of a female figure with dishevelled hair, wearing a gold chain with a medallion in the form of a mask, and brightly coloured drapery. These attributes, however, have to be seen in conjunction with the pose: the figure is shown on a steep diagonal seen from below and is sharply lit from the left with the right arm raised in the act of painting. It has been argued that the artist, being a woman, was able to undertake a self portrait of greater significance than those of her male counterparts, who were often primarily concerned with extolling their social status. Taking advantage of the fact that 'Painting' was personified by a female figure, Artemisia Gentileschi has combined in her self-portrait the theoretical and practical concepts of painting while at the same time drawing attention to her paradoxical status as a female artist in seventeenth-century society. The portrait demonstrates that intellectual allusion alone does not in itself make a painter, but that it must be combined with application

16592-7pitti.jpg	The picture shows the central scene on the ceiling: Allegory of the Medici-della Rovere Marriage. It was decided to decorate the rooms on the ground floor to mark the marriage of the young Ferdinando de' Medici, which formally took place in August 1634 but was not celebrated and consummated  until 1637, owing to the youth of his bride, Vittoria della Rovere, who was raised at the Florentine court. The depictions on the ceiling of the large Salone, which links the suites of the grand duke and his consort and served as antechamber to court ceremony, are particularly related  to that wedding, though the painting of the room was not yet completed by the time it was celebrated in July 1637

24027-5deathv.jpg	Mantegna's first important commission from Ludovico Gonzaga was the decoration of the chapel in Castello di San Giorgio, executed in the first half of the 1460s. It is unfortunately impossible to reconstruct the whole of Mantegna's original intentions there with any confidence, although some panels almost certainly traceable to the chapel still survive. They include the Death of the Virgin in Madrid.In a room framed by sombre pilasters, but looking out on to a view of the lake of Mantua, the Apostles gather round the dying Virgin. The skilfully constructed perspective is perfectly co-ordinated with the precisely drawn and coloured figures. The overall effect is severe, but its dignity is also vivid and moving. This is justly regarded as a masterpiece of the early Renaissance, with its detailed naturalism, radiant clarity and unshaken conviction

Of the three children born previously to them, one died at two months, the others at two weeks. Titus lived but the mother died when he was nine months old.Although Titus was trained as an artist, presumably by Rembrandt, this is not the way his father depicted him. Rather, he shows him engaged in writing, reading and speaking. In the present painting, in which Titus is engrossed in a book he grasps in his two hands, his expression is so lively, his mouth open, with a bit of smile on his face, that he seem to be reading aloud, a rare and intriguing subject. The painting shows Titus, born in 1641, at the age of about 16

26548-1chapel.jpg	"The chapel was built between 1475 and 1483, in the time of Pope Sixtus IV della Rovere. A basic feature of the chapel itself, so obvious that it is sometimes ignored, is the papal function, as the pope's chapel and the location of the elections of new popes. Furthermore, the building was in some respects a personal monument to the Della Rovere family, since Sixtus IV saw to its actual construction and the frescoes beneath the vaults, and his nephew Julius II commissioned the ceiling decoration. Oak leaves and acorns abound, heraldic symbols of the family whose name means literally ""from the oak.""The Chapel is rectangular in shape and measures 40,93 meters long by 13,41 meters wide, i.e. the exact dimensions of the Temple of Solomon, as given in the Old Testament. It is 20,70 meters high and is surmounted by a shallow barrel vault with six tall windows cut into the long sides, forming a series of pendentives between them. A marble mosaic floor of exquisite workmanship describes the processional itinerary up to and beyond the marble screen, to the innermost space, where it offers a surround for the papal throne and the cardinals' seats. The architectural plans were made by Baccio Pontelli and the construction was supervised by Giovanino de'Dolci. The walls are divided into three orders by horizontal cornices; according to the decorative program, the lower of the three orders was to be painted with fictive ""tapestries,"" the central one with two facing cycles - one relating the life of Moses (left wall) and the other the Life of Christ (right wall), starting from the end wall, where the altar fresco, painted by Perugino,  depicted the Virgin of the Assumption, to whom the chapel was dedicated. The upper order is endowed with pilasters that support the pendentives of the vault. Above the upper cornice are situated the lunettes. Between each window below the lunettes, in fictive niches, run images of the first popes - from Peter to Marcellus - who practiced their ministry in times of great persecution and were martyred.The wall paintings were executed by Pietro Perugino, Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Cosimo Rosselli, Luca Signorelli and their respective workshops, which included Pinturicchio, Piero di Cosimo and Bartolomeo della Gatta. The ceiling was frescoed by Piero Matteo d'Amelia with a star-spangled sky.Michelangelo was commissioned by Pope Julius II della Rovere in 1508 to repaint the ceiling; the work was completed between 1508 and 1512. He painted the Last Judgment over the altar, between 1535 and 1541, being commissioned by Pope Paul III Farnese"

The background is closed off, pushing the figures of the Virgin and Child to the front of the picture plane and investing the composition with a particular immediacy.

33989-1cappell.jpg	Beginning in 1607, Scipione Borghese, the art-loving nephew of Camillo Borghese, elected pope as Paul V, gave Guido Reni a series of important commissions, on which he was assisted by Annibale Carracci's pupils. In the fall of 1609 Reni was given the commission to paint the pope's private chapel in the Palazzo del Quirinale. The chapel, consecrated to the Annunciation to the Virgin, was on the piano nobile. The actual painting took a total of seven months. Nevertheless, payments to Reni stretched out over two years, until 1612. Reni was assisted in the execution of the painting by Giovanni Lanfranco, Francesco Albani and Antonio Carracci. The identification of the works executed by Lanfranco and Antonio Carracci is uncertain. After years of debate it is now generally agreed that each of them painted one of the two lunettes in the main room of the chapel. Francesco Albani painted the seven putti in the left-hand niche in the choir. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that Reni was responsible for the overall planning of the decoration, and purportedly engaged the other painters only because the pope wished it.The paintings of this chapel are among Reni's most outstanding works from a time when he was at the height of his powers. He painted a cycle of the Virgin concentrating on scenes related to the subject of the Immaculate Conception. In the small cupola of the main room we are shown God's election of Mary surrounded by choirs of angels, and in the pendentive below appear the four prophets Moses, David, Solomon, and Isaiah. In the lunettes of the main room the scenes Presentation of Mary to the Temple (left) and Annunciation to Joachim (right) are depicted. The cupola-like vault of the choir shows God the Father with arms outspread, surrounded by a glory of angels singing the Virgin's praises. The nude figure of Adam in the niche to the left of the altar alludes the original sin, which has been overcome thanks to Mary's contribution. The only narrative wall painting in the choir, on the left wall, is striking because of its unusual and rarely depicted subject matter. Mary, wearing a red dress and with her hair falling loosely across her shoulders, is bent over her sewing. She is framed by two adult angels while above her hover two putti with inscription ribbons alluding to her predestined role as mother of God.On the inner faï¿½ade above the door the multifigured scene of Mary's birth is painted. It is a visual and iconographic counterpart to the altarpiece, the Annunciation, an oil painting by Reni.The barrel vault and the lunettes in the extensions off the choir are filled with vivacious, charmingly arranged, frolicking putti with inscription ribbons and symbols of the Virgin (lily, palm branches, rose bush, olive branches) that combine to form an aesthetically pleasing ensemble.The picture shows a view of the chapel toward the choir: in the vault, God the Father giving benediction with angels, the altarpiece with Reni's Annunciation to the Virgin

18855-donorpre.jpg	Guercino, one of the best known Bolognese artists of the generation after the Carracci, painted this altarpiece in 1616 for the church of San Agostino in his native town of Cento between Bologna and Ferrara. However uncertain the identification of the young donor with the son of a benefactor of the church (Giuseppe Gaetano Righetti?) may be, what is certain is that this is a key work in the master's youthful oeuvre. In it he follows a balanced compositional structure that had been developed earlier by the Carracci. The painting differs from a preparatory sketch - kept at Brera in Milan - by a stricter application of symmetry: both in the upper register, with the Madonna and the angels at the same height, and below, where Saints Louis of France, Joseph, Francis of Assisi and Augustine, the patron saint of the church in question, direct Mary's attention on both sides to the donor, and in the other direction point his devotion upwards to her in a double arc.The balanced structure is echoed in the dialogue between the heavy pillar and the view into an airy distance in the middle, enlivened by the very varied lighting, gestures and expression of the figures. The drawing is accurate and the colour range sonorous, consonant with Guercino's reputation as both a great draughtsman and an excellent colourist, a reputation that he already enjoyed as a young man. Ludovico, the eldest of the Carracci, already praised Guercino for this, adding that he was a wonder of nature, who filled with amazement everyone who saw his work.Despite its major impact on European art, the fame of Bolognese painting did not last. To a certain extent it was the victim of its success, when a sugary variant came to dominate the official religious art of the 19th century in the relatively uninspired form of the Saint-Sulpice style, placing the Bolognese school in an unfavourable light amongst leading 20th century artists and art historians. Whilst gaining new advocates after the Second World War, insufficient light has been placed on its role in the art history of the Low Countries. An unprejudiced viewing, not of a sugary, derivative work, but of an original masterpiece like this one, clearly shows this relative lack of attention to be unjustified

32317-15summer.jpg	The Seasons, the four canvasses of Poussin's late period now in the Louvre, are an even more extreme personal statement than the Landscape with Diana and Orion. They are the supreme expression, not in this case of mind over eye, but of praise for the beauty and grandeur of nature, now ordered by man, and now defeating man. Spring is luxuriant, Summer a fecund harvest, Autumn the gathering of mellow grapes and Winter the terrible deluge in which all mankind is overwhelmed and destroyed.The biblical story depicted in Summer is the following.Ruth was a Moabite woman and great-grandmother of David, and therefore an ancestress of Christ, hence her place in Christian art. She was married to a Hebrew immigrant in Moab and after his death left her native land and went with her mother-in-law Naomi, to Bethlehem. Here she was allowed to glean the corn in the fields belonging to Boaz, a rich farmer and kinsman of Naomi. Ruth, true to her nature, maintained, on Naomi's advice, a modest demeanour among the young men working at the harvest. One night she went and lay at the feet of Boaz as he slept in the field. By this act Boaz saw her virtue and later decided to assume responsibilities towards her of a kinsman. In due course he married her.

34157-keppel.jpg	Commodore Keppel was one of fifteen children of the second Earl of Albemarle. After a circumnavigation of the world in 1740, Keppel had a meteoric career in the Royal Navy. As early as 1749, he was promoted to commodore. He invited the young Reynolds to accompany him to the Mediterranean, as a result of which the painter had the opportunity to visit Italy. This study trip was a milestone for Reynolds. The life-size portrait was his thank- you gift to Keppel after their return in 1752. The two remained friends for life.X-ray pictures show that Reynolds experimented with Keppel's pose, and changed it, but from the outset, there must have been the idea to quote the famous Belvedere Apollo. Keppel's striding posture resembles the classical statue, but is reproduced frontally. The borrowed pose bears the thought of the idealization of the individual.The painting shows the supple painting technique of the early works, carefully executed with soft brushes. Keppel is standing on a small strip of shoreline in front of a steep cliff-face. The dramatic scene relates to an event in 1747, when Keppel, following a shipwreck off the coast of Brittany - hinted at in the background - was arrested and court-martialled. The scenery with the storm, the wild surf, the rocky coast and the flickering lightning is in accordance with the aesthetic of the sublime, and enhances the heroic character of the naval officer, who, unimpressed by the forces of nature, poses for the painter. The pose and the landscape idealize the sitter

29205-trilog1.jpg	"Munkï¿½csy saw Tintoretto's four huge ""passion"" pictures in the Scuola di San Rocco, Venice, for the first time. Then he arrived to Budapest and spent two weeks in Kalocsa in the residence of Lajos Haynald, archbishop, a sponsor of ecclesiastical art and a  friend of Franz Liszt. Munkï¿½csy must have had the idea of painting the trilogy by then. He started to study the works of Rembrandt and Rubens and after thirty-five studies and sketches in oil, he painted the first composition sketch at the Easter of 1880. The picture was introduced to Karl Sedelmeyer, his sponsor, in Sedelmeyer's palace in Paris. The success which followed the exhibitions in Vienna, Budapest and more than twenty towns in Great Britain was enormous. Sedelmeyer completed the exhibition with sketches, studies, books and cuts. He took the picture to America in November 1886. Munkï¿½csy spent six weeks in New York, Philadelphia and Washington and painted portraits. John Wanamaker, a millionaire, bought the pictures ""Christ before Pilate"" and ""Golgotha"" for 120,000 and 100,000 dollars, respectively, in 1887, although some sources claimed  that the prices he payed were 175,000 and 160,000 dollars, respectively. Both pictures were borrowed to the World Exhibiton in Paris in 1889 and Wanamaker took them himself to the Chicago Exhibition in 1893. The two pictures were kept in the gallery of his country residence until 1907. When a fire broke out there, the pictures were removed and restored. In 1911-88 the two pictures faced each other in the gallery of  the Wanamaker-store on the 8th floor together with pictures by other painters. At the Sotheby's auction in 1988 there was a Canadian man bidding for the picture on the telephone and who bought it in the end. It turned out later that it was Joseph T. Tanenbaum. The picture arrived in Debrecen on 2nd February 1995. After restoration by Miklï¿½s Szentkirï¿½lyi, Istvï¿½n Lente and Erzsï¿½bet Bï¿½res in the spring of 1995, it was exhibited in Hungary on 25th August 1995, 113 years after its first exhibition in Hungary. This was in fact the first time that the complete Christ trilogy was exhibited.Although the enormous trilogy  relies on the words of the Bible (John 18 and 19, and Luke 23), yet it condenses them as well. The picture shows a victorious Christ who is standing in the middle with a radiant whiteness and defeats his spiteful enemies and the hesitating Roman governor. Several contemporary artists (Ivanov, Antokolski, and Gustave Dorï¿½) were engaged in the subject matter of the ""passion"", but Munkï¿½csy's work is second to none. He did not only prove that he knew the Bible, but he demonstrated his psychological skills, that he knew his age and himself, too. He went through the biblical events in a changing age full of doubts and he used it as an excuse to express his thoughts on and disappointment in the world and ethic"

00220-triptych.jpg	Much more of an innovator than either Catarino or Lorenzo Veneziano was Jacobello Alberegno, who in the Triptych with Crucifixion and Saints, his only signed work, reveals himself to be an artist of penetrating refinement. If it is true that the two lateral saints, St Gregory and St Jerome, are examples of stylized Gothic figures, the images of the small central panel display a naturalness worthy of one of the best of Giotto's disciples. An extraordinary human dimension seems to govern the expression of sentiments in the picture: a grief-stricken St John the Evangelist clutches his cloak to his breast while the Virgin extends imploring arms and stares transfixed with anguish at her crucified son

15220-luteplay.jpg	Of all the major followers of Caravaggio in Italy, Gentileschi is surely the strongest personality. Yet it was not so much the tenebroso and the dramatic handling of light in the middle and later period of the Lombard artists, but the clear and cool colority of Caravaggio's early work that he has taken up and adopted with great originality.The Lute Player, produced around the time of his emigration to England, is one of Gentileschi's most famous works. A young girl in a lemon-yellow dress is seated with her back to the spectator at a table on which a violin, a shawm and two music scores are lying. Listening intently, the girl has lifted the lute to her ear, and is concentrating her entire attention on the chord that the fingers of her left hand are strumming on the broad body of the instrument.It is not easy to interpret this painting, particularly as it was created in a period when allegorical messages tended to be conveyed through seemingly everyday genre scenes. The fact that she is listening so intently would certainly suggest an allegory of hearing, but it is just as possible that this is intended as a portrayal of Harmonia, the pleasing combination of different parts, as suggested by the nineteen strings of the double lute the girl is playing.

18932-4parts.jpg	During his fifty-year reign (1680-1730) Vittorio Amadeo II transformed Turin, the second royal residence on Italian soil after Naples, into one of the most splendid Baroque cities in Europe. In 1584 he started the enlargement of the palace known as the Palazzo Reale. The additions to the palace were patterned after the models of French court architecture, but for the wall decorations he looked for Italian painters. The decoration continued under the reign of Carlo Emanuele III (1730-1773).In a small room in the western part of the new apartment, known as the Appartamento d'Estate, the Roman painter Gregorio Guglielmi painted The Four Parts of the World. He executed this ceiling painting as a cheerful and airy capriccio. The four regions, represented by charming female personifications, are backed by a colourful backdrop of clouds, which are largely responsible for the pictorial effect of the composition. Inn the centre a minimal grouping of gods, consisting of Jupiter, Juno, and Mercury, are bestowing their favours on Europa, who is given the attributes of a tiara and the gold imperial orb

24096-5grisai1.jpg	From 1490 onwards, Mantegna produced a series of illusionistic works representing sculptural reliefs in marble or bronze. These are in grisaille, light and dark tones of a single colour creating figures that stand against a background simulating boldly patterned marble. In Italy, pictures like this, which appear to be carved in stone, were first seen in the bases of Giotto's frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua, where he illustrated the seven Virtues and seven Vices. At the end of the 15th century, grisaille work was in great demand, and Mantegna painted a number of pictures in this technique, including two heroines of purity and constancy, Sophonisba and Tuccia. These figures presumably formed part of a larger series.Sophonisba, the daughter of the Carthaginian statesman Hasdrubal (3rd century BC), was for reasons of state married to men one after the other. When the Roman leader Scipio demanded that Sophonisba be handed over after her husband had been taken prisoner, she drank a cup of poison rather than be taken by the enemy

08548-1bather2.jpg	During the last years of his life, Cï¿½zanne decided to devote a number of large compositions to a motif he had painted at the beginning of his career as an artist: semi-abstract figures in a landscape. Aged over sixty, he recalled the most carefree and happy time of his life when he would go out with his friends exploring the area around Aix and spending many hours on the banks of the river. He produced many drawings, watercolours and oil paintings of these bathing scenes, calling them Idyll, Nudes on the Riverbank or simply bathers. In all, he produced some 140 drawings, sketches and paintings depicting this motif.The theme of the bathers in Cï¿½zanne's work can be traced back to the beginning of the 1870s. Male and female bathers rarely appear together in the same painting, and the late works are therefore very different from the dramatic pictures of the 1860s and early 1870s, in which Cï¿½zanne used the confrontation between the sexes in a provocative way. Cï¿½zanne's aim in strictly segregating the sexes in the Bathers series was to exclude any connotations from the situation, any element of the transient, sensual or erotic. This meant that his figures became internalised, spiritual beings, and he could concentrate wholly on the purely formal, compositional problems of his pictures because they had been freed of content

28793-sfrancis.jpg	"In some respects this work is associated with the point in Morazzone's career when he was working on the frescoes in the seventh chapel at the Sacro Monte, Varese. The painting may be viewed as a symbol of the tireless search for subtleties and depth of feeling that marked the Counter-Reformation spirit of seventeenth-century Lombard painting. Having abandoned the profane elegance of the preceding period, it strains for a programmed mortification of the senses. The corrupt and corruptible body is the principal subject, and tears and sorrow prevail. Intended to show a forthright, almost brutal realism, this St Francis achieves the opposite effect. From its insistent ""reality"" there emerges an absolute abstraction, an entirely expressionistic unreality. Impetuous rhythms explode in and around the metallic brown habit, the claw-like hands, the drawn mask of the face, the agitated sky and the highlights on the figure."

11644-2scene2.jpg	The picture shows the scene of Meeting of St Nilus with Emperor Otto III. This scene is located on the left long wall of the main room of the Cappella dei Santi Fondatori. It is one of the seven scenes depicting events from the lives of the two founder saints. According to legend, the emperor, severely chastised by Nilus for his unmerciful persecution of the antipope Johannes Philagatos, took the opportunity to call n the holy man in Serperi, near Gaeta, while on pilgrimage to Monte Gargano. During this interview, the emperor offered him anything he wished, but Nilus was solely concerned with the salvation of the ruler's soul

07664-carlev09.jpg	A wooden boat-bridge stretches across the entire width of the scene, from Palazzo Gritti on the left towards the church of Santa Maria della Salute, which is not actually shown. The faï¿½ade on the right, behind the Punta della Dogana, is that of Andrea Palladio's San Giorgio Maggiore. In the foreground we see a small group of people in a gondola; other figures are depicted on the bridge. Behind the bridge, on the Bacino di San Marco, are sailboats, gondolas and rowboats. The buildings on the Riva degli Schiavoni enclose the scene.The composition is distinguished by the strong vertical accent created by the buildings on the left, which rise to the full height of the image, and by the horizontal line of the bridge. The bridge is not shown in its entirety, and must have been about twice as long in reality; wooden structures of this kind were normally elevated in the middle, as we can see on the right, to allow boats to pass underneath.In July 1630 Venice was struck by another devastating plague. Doge Nicolo Contarini and the Senate decided to invoke the Virgin's intercession, vowing to build a church if their prayers were heeded. The church would be consecrated to the Madonna della Salute &#151; the word 'salute' meaning both 'health' and 'salvation' &#151; and it would be the focus of an annual procession.When the epidemic subsided in November 1631, construction of the church began and the first procession took place. To enable the faithful to cross the Grand Canal on foot, a floating bridge is built every year on about 21 November, the Feast of the Purification.By comparison to other paintings of the subject concentrating on the massive procession to the Redentore, Carlevaris included a much smaller number of figures, shown crossing the bridge to the Salute either alone or in small groups. Most of the people on the bridge are returning to the city, and the gondola in the foreground is moving in that direction as well. Instead of the ceremonial journey it is the wooden bridge, an ephemeral topographical detail in the Venetian cityscape, that is the true focus of the composition.Carlevaris' s painting marks a new phase in the representation of historical and festive events. In contrast to his predecessors the master emphasized neither the procession nor its goal, but rather the cityscape itself, in which the figures play a subordinate role.

38919-03educat.jpg	The figures in this altarpiece are portrayed more as the heroines of noble dramas than as saints. They combine true pathos with elegant sensuality, as if they were creatures of some higher human species. At the same time, however, they are firmly linked to our sense of everyday life through the descriptive details which are so naturalistic as to border on trompe-l'oeil.In the centre of the representation, in front of a magnificent architectural backdrop, stands Mary as a young girl, reading from an open book, and instructed by her mother, who sits next to her. Her father, standing to her right, is deep in prayer and has his eyes raised towards Heaven. What is striking about the composition, is the diagonal line which runs from the three angels' heads beneath the book to the three large angels above Mary, and which symbolizes the way to the Kingdom of Heaven.You can view other depictions of the Education of the Virgin in the Web Gallery of Art

04509-story_io.jpg	The size and shape of the panel suggest that it was used in a domestic setting as a spalliera which would have been attached at shoulder height to a cassone, or marriage chest. Its secular subject matter is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses and tells the story of Io.The beginning of the story, in which Jupiter transformed himself into a cloud to seduce the young Io, is not shown in the present panel, most likely because it was depicted on a companion spalliera. Here Biagio's pictorial interpretation of the narrative runs from left to right and is mostly faithful to the second part of Ovid's original. In order to deceive his wife Juno, Jupiter transformed Io into a heifer, seen here at left, but Juno, aware of the ruse, demanded to be given the cow as a gift. When she charged the hundred-eyed Argus to watch over the heifer, Jupiter sent his loyal servant Mercury to rescue Io, seen upper left. After lulling Argus to sleep with music from his hand-pipes, Mercury decapitated him and set Io free (not shown here). Argus's eyes were then placed by Juno in the peacock's tail (where they remain to this day). Io, still in the form of a heifer, is subsequently seen panting on the bank of the Nile fleeing from Juno's persecution. She is depicted looking up begging for forgiveness from the queen of the gods, seen upper right beside Jupiter, who also pleads on Io's behalf. Io was indeed eventually forgiven and is seen restored to her human form on the right side of the bank where she is welcomed back into her family

23338-05odoni.jpg	"The humanist and antique dealer Andrea Odoni is presented amidst his collection of antiques. He sits at a green-covered table, wearing a voluminous and richly lined, fur-collared coat. His large head, inclined a little to one side, is framed by his beard, and by his dark hair, which is parted in the middle. Gazing at the spectator, Odoni has placed one hand on his chest in a gesture of ""sincerit&#224;"" (here: reverence, or deference), while his other holds out a small, possibly Egyptian statue to the spectator. By contrast with the room in Titian's portrait of Jacopo de Strada, Odoni's antique cabinet is simply furnished. Against the whitewashed wall, the statues seem to have developed a fantastic life of their own, especially on the right where the shadows are deeper. Antaeus is shown wrestling with Hercules on the left, while a statue on the right, from the Vatican Belvedere court, shows Hercules with the skin of the Nemean lion. On the far right there is yet another Hercules, a ""Hercules mingens"" (the Classical hero as ""Manneken Pis""), before a well, or trough, over which a female figure, perhaps Venus, is leaning.Classical antiquity seems revived in the form of a huge head emerging from under the table-cloth. In fact, this is the head of Emperor Hadrian, the ""Adrian de stucco"" mentioned by Marcantonio Michiel in 1555 in his Odoni-collection inventory. The much smaller torso of Venus appears to nestle up to the head, to - probably calculated - comic effect. Although monochromatic, and indeed partly ruined, the sculptures seem mysteriously animated. Lotto invokes the magical properties of the image; he gently parodies the theme of the ""re-birth"" of Classical art by taking it literally.The small statue in the collector's hand, reminiscent of Diana of Ephesus, indicates the artist's and sitter's demonstrable interest in Egyptian religion. At Venice, Lorenzo Lotto's place of birth, where he often stayed - the painting was executed after 1526, while Lotto was staying at Venice - there was widespread interest among the humanists in Egyptian hieroglyphics as a source of arcane knowledge and divine wisdom. This ""science"" could be traced back to Horapollo, the author of a treatise on hieroglyphics, which had survived in Greek translation"

07475-11fortu.jpg	"With The Fortune Teller (La Zingara), Caravaggio introduced, around 1594/95, a subject into Italian painting that was known, if at all, only in Netherlandish paintings: the so-called genre, depicting scenes of everyday life, but with a hidden or underlying meaning intended for the edification of the observant spectator. Two themes from Caravaggio's early years can be placed in the category of genre painting: one representing a card game is unfortunately lost, the other is the Fortune Teller. This theme is preserved in two paintings both of which are probably original. The other painting is in the Pinacoteca Capitolina in Rome.A foppishly dressed young man, a milksop with no experience of life, gives his right hand to a young girl whose expression is difficult to define, in order to have his future read. His ideas about his future are effectively influenced by the astute young gypsy girl, whose gentle caress in tracing the lines of his hand captivates the handsome young fool so completely that he fails to notice his ring being drawn from his finger. This anecdotal narrative could be further embroidered, and indeed the painting invites us to do so as much through the plot it portrays as through what it tells us of the two characters by way of their clothing. The feathered hat, the gloves and the showy, oversized dagger immediately tell us who we are dealing with here. Similarly, the gypsy girl with her light linen shirt and her exotic wrap is intended as a ""type"" rather than as an individual person.This means, of course, that what we have here is not an anecdote of two specific people, but an everyday tale. No specification of place or time detracts our attention from the point of the story, which gives the spectator a sense of complacent superiority as well as aesthetic pleasure"

Dance-Holland studied art under Francis Hayman (c. 1708-1776), and like many contemporaries also studied in Italy. He painted several history and classical paintings, and he was influenced by the portrait style of Pompeo Batoni.In England Dance-Holland became a successful portrait painter, one of his most famous portraits is of 'Captain Cook' (1766). With Hayman and his architect brother George Dance the Younger (1741-1825), he was one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768.In 1790 he retired from being an artist, became an MP, and was created a baronet

13295-annuncia.jpg	Our knowledge of the life and work of this artist is based on a series of assumptions. It is thought that he trained in the workshop of Jan van Eyck, and from the 1440s onwards executed miniatures and panel paintings for Renï¿½ of Anjou and others of his circle. It is uncertain whether he accompanied Renï¿½ to Italy in 1440, during the latter's brief rule over Naples, or whether he was employed by the Dukes of Burgundy during that period. Following Renï¿½'s return in the mid-1440s, Barthï¿½lemy added about five miniatures to one of his older codices (London, British Library), and also illuminated a book of hours for him, in collaboration with Enguerrand Quarton (New York, The Morgan Library and Museum).Between 1443 and 1445 he is believed to have executed a winged altarpiece for Aix-en-Provence. After another extensive series of miniatures, he produced his masterpieces, namely seven miniatures in a French edition of Boccaccio's Thï¿½sï¿½ide (Vienna, ï¿½sterreichische Nationalbibliothek) and the 16 illustrations to the Livre du Cuer d'Amour espris - these latter representing one of the supreme artistic achievements of their day.The Annunciation, which since the Revolution has been kept in the church of St Mary Magdalene in the Provencal capital, was the main panel of an altarpiece which the clothmaker Pierre Corpici commissioned for the altar which he had endowed in the city's Saint-Sauveur cathedral. While the first impression is of a plain and monumental setting, the painter in fact pays loving attention to the details of the stained glass, the leaves flickering like flames on the capitals, and the heads and bats in the tracery.Although Barthï¿½lemy d'Eyck can be assumed to be related to Jan and Hubert van Eyck, the present work falls fully in line with artistic practice in the Mediterranean sphere - from its thicker, less translucent application of paint to the gold brocade of the Virgin's cloak. At the same time, its astonishing realism at times goes far beyond even Netherlandish painting. There is a pronounced three-dimensionality to the composition as a whole; forms are weighty and substantial, while skin surfaces are sharply differentiated. Mary's hair is not perfectly coiffured, but instead full, almost flaxen. The wonderfully observed, plump cushions and the bunch of flowers also have a quite different spatial presence to their northern counterparts. This impression is reinforced on the one hand by the relatively plain metal jug and the quietly unforced arrangement of the flowering Marian symbols plucked, so it seems, at random from the garden, and on the other by the surrounding empty space and the sharp, spotlight type of lighting.The architecture also appears solid and three-dimensional, and is wonderfully observed against the light - as in the tracery on the left above the angel's wing, and the roundel through which the Christ Child floats down, already shouldering his Cross. The figures listening to Mass and strolling around at the back of the church lend the composition an astonishing depth, even though the artist - doubtless deliberately - has not attempted to depict the room and the figures to scale

13264-0oranje.jpg	Frederik Hendrik (1584-1647), Prince of Orange, became stadholder in 1625 - initially of five provinces and later of seven. The prince's universally recognised strength lay in conquests of a predominantly military nature, yet he was also an important patron of the arts and a man who commissioned buildings of royal status.He built several palaces, including the palace of Huis ten Bosch in The Hague, which was originally intended as a modest country house in the woods for his wife, Amalia van Solms. At Frederik Hendrik's death in 1674, his widow conceived a plan to honour the life, deeds, and memory of her late husband in the Oranjezaal (Orange Hall) in her own new palace Huis ten Bosch. Constantijn Huygens would serve as adviser, and Jacob van Campen was commissioned to oversee the execution of the painted decoration. With its programmatic mixture of mythology, allegory, and actual historical events, the cycle recalls the glorifying decorative programs that Rubens had painted for the Spanish, French, and English courts.The decorations cover the walls of the cross-shaped central hall with chamfered inner corners from floor to ceiling and were executed by Pieter de Grebber, Salomon de Bray, Caesar van Everdingen, Pieter Soutman, Gerrit van Honthorst, and Jacob van Campen himself. In addition to these Northern Netherlandish artists, several Southern Netherlandish painters were also retained, including Jacob Jordaens, who completed the largest canvas in 1652, Triumph of Frederik Hendrik, and Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert and Theodoor van Thulden.The Orange Hall, some 19 metres high, is painted from floor to ceiling. Painted on wood inside the dome are the heavens, with a portrait of Amalia van Solms in the centre, and there are celestial scenes painted between each of the ribs. On the walls below are thirty enormous canvases depicting events in the life of the stadholderThe picture shows a view of the hall with Van Everdingen's overmantel painting on the east wall depicting the birth of Frederik Hendrik

15095-burning1.jpg	"A monumental altarpiece was commissioned from Geertgen in 1484 for the Chapel of the Knights of St John in Haarlem, probably for the special visit of the grand prior of the Order of the Knights of St John to Haarlem. The inner right wing of the huge triptych depicted the Lamentation, while the exterior of the right wing showed the Burning of the Bones of St John the Baptist. The two panels are now in Vienna, the other parts of the triptych are lost.The exterior of the right wing represents the legend of the burning of the bones of St John the Baptist and their recovery by the original Knights of Malta. The five figures standing beside the open sarcophagus wearing the Maltese cross are the officers of the Haarlem commandery of the Knights. They appear a second time on the path that leads to the church in the right background carrying the relics, a thighbone and a finger, that were presented to the Order in Rhodes in 1482-83. Six other figures appear to the right of those in Maltese uniform. The one to the extreme right, gazing dreamingly into space, is the artist himself.The two panels in the Vienna museum make Geertgen the ancestor of the painters of ""collective portraits"", of which Frans Hals and Rembrandt were to be the great masters"

19128-29nogeo.jpg	This  painting and the Banquet of the Officers of the St Hadrian Civic Guard Company of Haarlem (Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem) are outstanding examples of how carefully Hals calculated his candid effects. He heightened the momentary quality of both pictures by interlacing the figures on the surface of the canvas and in depth. The impression is of casual irregularity, but, as in his technique, a hidden order underlies his large composition.In both banquet pieces he links up two principal groups by long diagonals, and each single group shows a central seated figure, around which the other men are arranged, some seated and some standing. The crossing of the main diagonals coincides with the head of a seated figure in the second plane, which gains through this scheme and added interest and becomes a kind of of occult centre. Ingenious variety of of position and movement relates the figures to each other or to the spectator. The final result is an unprecedented illusion of an animated gathering.The impression that these guardsmen could consume gargantuan quantities of of food and liquor is confirmed by an ordinance laid down by the municipal authorities of Haarlem in 1621. Town official took cognizance of the fact that some of the banquets of the militia lasted a whole week. Considering that the municipality had to pay the costs, and that the times were troubled (the ordinance was written after hostilities with Spain had been resumed), it was decreed that the celebrations 'were not to last longer than three, or at the most four days...'

28461-landgrot.jpg	Joos de Momper may well have undertaken an Italian journey and been deeply impressed by Alpine vistas. His grandiose, sometimes phantasmagorical mountain scenes frequently include a grotto, as does the present painting. While in other artists' work grottoes usually figure as elevated sites of religious pilgrimage, in this painting the motif becomes the focus of the composition. One of the three accessory figures is characterized as an artist, down on his knees and drawing the rocks in front of him. Although this is not the first appearance in Momper's work of the figure of the artist in the great outdoors, it is indicative that here he deals with the phenomena of the mountain realm. This enthusiasm corresponded with the emergence of Alpinism, represented in the sixteenth century especially by Swiss naturalists and litterateurs

38963-07discov.jpg	According to legend, St Helen, the mother of Constantine the Great, discovered the True Cross on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Tiepolo portrays the saint, in daring foreshortening from below, making a triumphal gesture in front of the Cross, which towers up into the sky. She is surrounded by the usual retinue of soldiers, holy men, the old and the young, women and children, commonly used by Tiepolo as extras in his paintings. A number of angels hover over the scene, carrying a thurible and a tablet bearing the name of Christ, looking down on the miracle of the discovery of the cross.This grandiose tondo, originally the centrepiece of the ceiling decorated by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna in the Capuchin church in Castello, is a typical example of Tiepolo's ability to translate any theme, sacred or profane into a stupendous Baroque magniloquence. Within the monumental order the areas of colour are arranged in patterns of polychromatic splendour, suffused with a pure light which highlights every carefully observed detail. In this remarkable example of illusionistic perspective, with which Tiepolo never tired of amazing his contemporaries, the images are characterized by distinct notes of colours and emotion with a fascinating musical decorative freshness

40993-03diptyc.jpg	The left-hand panel of this diptych depicts the adoration of the Infant Jesus by the Magi; the right-hand panel represents the Crucifixion. This is another of the pictures whose origin has been the subject of considerable speculation among scholars, for the international uniformity which is the hallmark of the International Gothic style has led to the picture being ascribed to Avignon, Paris, Franco-Flemish, Austrian and Bohemian artists. Perhaps the closest analogy can be found in the works of the Master of Trebon (the folds of the Virgin's mantle, undulating in a similar manner, or the insubstantial birds on the roof of the Bethlehem stable). On the other hand, these details could be coincidental, or derived from a common source; until the coat of arms on the ornate bed can be positively identified these questions will remain open to speculation

05441-12judith.jpg	The picture was probably created in pendant with The Discovery of the Murder of Holofernes; both of them are documented at the end of 16th century in Medicean collections, where entered as a gift received by Bianca Cappello, the second wife of Grand Duke Francesco I. The small scale of the paintings indicates that they were not intended as decoration for a piece of furniture. We know from contemporary inventories that paintings of similarly small dimensions were kept as precious objects in caskets or leather cases, to be admired at close proximity or shown to friends on special occasions. The miniature-like delicacy and detailed execution, conceived for close-range observation, leads to the supposition that the little panels were intended for just such a purpose.The Biblical tale of Judith, who slew Holofernes, the Assyrian king's commander-in-chief, because he represented a deadly threat for the Hebrews in Bethulia, was one of the favourite subjects of the Florentine Renaissance. Judith was considered the prototype of female strength, since she alone had summoned up the courage to murder the tyrant. In The Return of Judith to Bethulia, Botticelli shows us Judith together with Abra, her maid, the two of them striding out in a well-nigh furious manner. Abra is carrying Holofernes' severed head on her own head, while Judith has an olive branch in her hand as a symbol of peace, which she is bringing to the Hebrews. Botticelli has succeeded here in capturing both movement and stillness in a unique balance. Judith is pausing a moment in her striding forward to turn towards the observer, self-assured if not without a touch of melancholy, exactly as if she wished to present herself as the victor.

33008-09farnes.jpg	Raphael's pictorial narrative in the Loggia di Psiche begins in the spandrels of the short side on the left as one enters and continues along the spandrels to the right to the second short side and then along the entrance side. These triangular surfaces represented a problematic format for artists. Raphael solved this challenge in ever new and surprising ways, causing the form of the painting's support and the composition of its figures to interact in particularly fortuitous and varied manners.In the spandrel of the right-hand short wall Mercury appeals for Psyche to be found.

03548-07bather.jpg	In the summer of 1869 at Mï¿½ric, Bazille had painted one of his most striking works, one that gained acceptance by the 1870 Salon. The Bathers shows a number of youths in a grove of birches, fooling about and bathing in a pool. There is an occasional clumsiness in the rendering of the bodies, the foreshortening of perspective, and the painting of the water. The lighting of the figures is uneven, and they do not seem to be lit by the same sources as the setting. But what is arresting in this picture by a man still in his twenties is its view of life and of man, and its determination to rediscover the figurative values of the old masters in modern everyday life. The man leaning against the tree at left resembles a St Sebastian, the reclining youth an ancient river deity, and the helpfulness of the man at right may recall Christ helping the damned up out of purgatory

12366-1young_s.jpg	In many ways Karel Dujardin is the most Dutch of the Italianate painters. His bucolic landscapes are done on a small scale, and have an intimacy lacking in pictures made by Italianates who used a larger format and more ambitious motifs. Dujardin was apprenticed to Berchem and probably travelled to Italy in the late 1640s or early 1650s, but like so many other Dutch Italianate artists of his generation this early trip south cannot be substantiated. In 1652 he was in Amsterdam and during the next few years his art took an unexpected turn. Instead of settling down in Holland to paint views of the Campagna and the vita popolare of Rome, as most Italianate Dutch painters did after their documented or putative trips to Italy, he made pictures of the Dutch countryside which are closely related to Paulus Potter's carefully executed small paintings of cattle in sunny meadows and woods. During this phase it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the hand of Potter from Dujardin's.By the end of the 1650s he began once again to paint bambocciate and modest Italian pastoral scenes. His Young Shepherd, datable to the early 1660s, shows him at his best. The theme is simple. A young boy lies on his back playing with his dog. The sheep, the old grazing horse, and the basket and keg appear to lie about in a haphazard fashion. In a black and white reproduction, only the mountains tell us that this is not a Dutch scene, but when the original or even a good colour reproduction is viewed, warm Italian air and the strong shimmering light of the south permeate it.

13495-zodiac.jpg	According to Vasari, Falconetto produced a number of works for Ludovico Gonzaga, a member of a collateral branch of the ruling Gonzaga family in Mantua. These works include the fresco decoration in the Sala dello Zodiaco (Hall of the Zodiac) in what is now part of the Palazzo d'Arco. Here the artist, who was expert in all things ancient, painted a large cosmological decoration based on the Cycle of Months that Pinturicchio painted in the Roman palace of Cardinal Domenico della Rovere in about 1490, which is today almost totally lost.Falconetto created a complex architectural framework decorated with fictive marble reliefs and pilasters sporting capricious grotesques and imperial medallions, all beneath a splendid frieze animated by satyrs, sphinxes, and a variety of monstrous creatures that alternate with mythological scenes taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Twelve arched openings penetrate this riot of decoration, and each offers an illusionistic view into a deep passage that ends with an architectural monument, usually something recognizable like the Arch of Augustus in Fano, the tomb of Theodoric at Ravenna, or the Coliseum. Each archway is also painted with the zodiac sign appropriate to the month it represents and is populated with characters from ancient history and myth

43612-10saturn.jpg	Like his great compatriots, Poussin and Claude, the Parisian Simon Vouet began his career in Italy. His early works reflect the influence of Caravaggio and Lanfranco; Baroque animation, heavy forms and dramatic contrast of light and shadow are characteristic of the paintings he produced in Rome and Naples. In 1627 Vouet returned to France to become one of the leading masters and a favourite painter of official circles. He gradually adapted his subjects and style to suit the new requirements, painting decorative compositions for the palaces in Paris and for castles in the country. They were usually allegorical or mythological compositions with noble and pure forms rendered with light colours and harmonious lines.

17056-paris06.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 227, JH 1170.During his sojourn in The Hague van Gogh had tried to represent a modern city as it changed and expanded. His attention was focused on the uneven edges where town and country met, often awkwardly: straggling housing developments, iron-rolling mills in meadows beside windmills, new streets, as yet unbuilt, marked out by lamp-posts. In Paris van Gogh explored similar aspects of that phenomenon, and in doing so he shared the concerns of the first generation of Impressionists. But they had portrayed the leisure-places in the fast-growing suburbs as well as Paris itself - Montmartre for instance. Van Gogh lived in Montmartre, just below the famous Moulin de la Galette (then a dance-hall), and this detail of one of his initial paintings of the mill shows the urban face of Montmartre. He also painted a Montmartre that was still rural, the place of stone quarries, market gardens and windmills. The broad handling and dull palette are reminiscent of his Nuenen work. The figures are just silhouettes composed of slicks of paint. None the less, one can still glean from this abbreviated figure notation the mixed social composition of the Montmartre street scene - a bourgeois, a workman, some fashionably dressed ladies

36201-madchild.jpg	Around 1450, the year in which St Bernardino was canonized Sano di Pietro was commissioned to paint numerous images of the patron saint of Siena. These historical events explain the large number of small devotional panels depicting the Madonna and Child flanked by St Bernardino and usually one other saint, of which the present panel is a fine example. The sunken cheeks of St Bernardino and the physiognomic resemblance among the various representations of the saint, are explained by the fact that Sano di Pietro apparently used a wax mask, taken of the saint's head at the moment of his death, to ensure an accurate likeness (a cast of the mask was at one time preserved at the museum of Aquila).

21025-portsilv.jpg	This painting belongs to a group of small full-length portraits in meticulously delineated interiors, executed by the Amsterdam artist Thomas de Keyser in the 1620s and 30s, which were extremely influential upon the development of Dutch portrait painting in the second quarter of the seventeenth century. In each case the sitter is placed in a rich interior, informally posed with lively gestures, looking confidently out at the viewer. The first of this series is de Keyser's splendid portrait of the Stadholder's secretary Constantijn Huygens and his clerk of 1627 (National Gallery, London), which seems to have been an immediate success.The sitter of this painting is identified as the Amsterdam gold- and silversmith Christian van Vianen (c.1600-1667), who later became court goldsmith to Charles II of England. Christian was the son of Adam and the nephew of Paulus van Vianen. The painting is signed with monogram and dated centre left: TDK 1630

36380-1nevi.jpg	This altarpiece, known from its subject as the Madonna delle Nevi (the Madonna of the Snows) was originally commissioned for one of the oldest and most venerable altars in the Siena cathedral. It stood immediately left of the doorway known as the Porta del Perdono - the side entrance to the cathedral that provided most immediate access to both the baptistery and to the civic centre of the Palazzo Pubblico and the Campo.Sassetta received the commission in 1430 from Ludovica Bertini, the widow of Turino di Matteo, the man responsible for both the cathedral sacristy and the baptismal font. According to one local chronicler, Turino had died in 1423 and been buried in front of the Porta del Perdono. In the contract for the altarpiece, Ludovica makes it clear that she is commissioning the work both in memory of her husband and also in her own right as a pious Franciscan tertiary, so the coat-of-arms of her own family as well as that of her husband appear prominently displayed on the richly ornamented fabric covering the Virgin's throne. Her commitment to the Franciscan Order is clearly demonstrated by the inclusion of Saint Francis in the right foreground of the main panel of the altarpiece. The imagery chosen for the rest of the altarpiece, however, was entirely Sienese and civic in intention. It depicts the familiar subject of the enthroned Virgin with the Christ Child on her lap and surrounded by angels and saints. The altarpiece therefore echoes the imagery of two of Siena's most revered civic icons - the front face of Duccio's high altarpiece for the cathedral  and Simone Martini's mural in the council hall of the Palazzo Pubblico. That such an association was explicitly intended is shown by the inscription engraved on the Virgin's halo: 'If you trust me, Siena, you will be full of favour'.The imagery of the altarpiece was elaborated in order to honour two of the Virgin's titles - 'Queen of Heaven' and 'Our Lady of the Snows'. Two angels behind the throne hold a crown over the Virgin's head. The angel on the left of the throne, meanwhile, carries a dish filled with snow and the angel on the right makes a snowball. The seven narrative scenes of the predella describe in detail the legend of Our Lady of the Snows. They show how, in the reign of Pope Liberius (352-66), the Virgin caused snow to fall miraculously in the heat of August on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. Furthermore, the snow fell precisely in the pattern of the ground plan of a church. The Virgin then instructed a wealthy layman and his wife, and Pope Liberius, to build a church in her honour on this site - a church that became Santa Maria Maggiore, one of Rome's major basilicas

17157-portra09.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 488, JH 1624.Van Gogh's major ambition throughout his artistic career was to be a painter of the figure. He was hindered from realizing this desire by the inadequacy of his artistic education; he had not studied anatomy and other related academic preliminaries to a sufficient degree. Nor was he always able to afford to pay for the hire of models. Despite these drawbacks portraiture became an increasingly important component of his artistic production and a plank in his programme for modern art.Madame Joseph-Michel Ginoux (Marie Julien, 1848&#150;1911) was the proprietress of the Cafï¿½ de la Gare, where Van Gogh lived in Arles between May and September 1888, before he rent and moved into the nearby Yellow House.Van Gogh has painted this woman of Arles, resplendent in her local costume - itself reminiscent of the costume of Dutch seventeenth-century burgher ladies - in the format typical of Frans Hals's and Rembrandt's portraits, against a plain background. Gauguin had drawn Madame Ginoux too and van Gogh made a painted copy of his portrait in 1890, but he included two books, as he had in his own 1888 version. In the latter the titles are legible; one is Dickens' Christmas Tales and the other Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. This practice was to become frequent in van Gogh's portraiture. He relied on the added meanings introduced by literature to raise the portrait from a mere record of likeness to the desired status of figure painting

14922-3ponta04.jpg	Among Gauguin's masterpieces painted in Brittany are the Vision after the Sermon (1888) and the Yellow Christ (1889). In both paintings Breton peasants, to whom Gauguin was attracted as exotic, noncultivated types, figure prominently. Gauguin's usual bright colours and simplified shapes treated as flat silhouettes are present, but these paintings also reveal his symbolist leanings. Objects and events are taken out of their normal historical contexts.In the Vision Breton women observe an episode described in Genesis: Jacob wrestling with a stranger who turns out to be an angel. Gauguin suggests thereby that the faith of these pious women enabled them to see miraculous events of the past as vividly as if they were occurring before them.The painting is divided into two parts by the large diagonal tree-trunk, an arrangement taken from Japanese woodcuts. The foreground is filled by group of women, dressed in traditional Breton costumes, as they return from the Mass. The background depicts the biblical scene of Jacob's battle with the angel.After this painting Gauguin became an influential member, even the leader of the Pont-Aven School which included the painters Paul Sï¿½rusier, ï¿½mile Bernard, Charles Laval, Louis Anquetin, Armand Seguin, Jacob Meyer de Haan

39659-07lawren.jpg	The Martyrdom of St Lawrence was painted for the now demolished church of the Crociferi  in Venice. Titian in his later years seemed preoccupied with the fate of those who defied authority, and the present work is about a desperate attempt - in this case by the forces of paganism - to suppress dissent in secret and at night away from the public gaze. The sweep of the figures from upper right to lower left reinforces the curve of the trident thrust into St Lawrence's ribs and the martyr's face is brutalized by pain even as he recognizes his salvation, a ray of light punched through the cloud cover.The painting was probably inspired by the Passion of St Lawrence by the early Christian writer Prudentius, in which the saint's martyrdom symbolized the transition from paganism to Christianity.Titian seized the opportunity to pay tribute to Philip of Spain, who on August 10, the Feast of St Lawrence, in 1557, had defeated the French army at the battle of Saint Quentin. The two soldiers on the right are wearing Spanish armour, and their red standard bears the black eagle of the Habsburgs

17008-nuenen23.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 193, JH 914.In December 1883 van Gogh moved back to the region in which he had grown up, Brabant. His aims as an artist, initially evolved in Drenthe, were to be realized in Brabant, in the 'heart of rural life'. He would become a painter of peasants, in the footsteps of Jean Franï¿½ois Millet, who was for van Gogh the peasant painter and the founder of modern art. In Nuenen van Gogh was able to paint and draw more from the figure; the rural labourers of Brabant were often unemployed and, because they needed money, they agreed to pose for the painter. The most important work of this period in Nuenen was a multi-figure composition of peasants at home eating their meal - The Potato-Eaters (1885; Otterlo, Rijksmuseum Kroller-Muller). The picture was harshly criticized. Van Rappard, friend and fellow artist, questioned van Gogh's right to claim comparison with Millet. To answer this, van Gogh began a series of large drawings of men and women digging, cutting wood, gleaning - tasks which Millet had represented in his series of drawings, Labours of the Fields.Van Gogh also responded to the disappointment of his ambitions for The Potato Eaters by returning to pure landscapes, but using a brighter and richer palette than he had been able to in Drenthe. This painting of a wheat sheaf is typical of these new colour studies. The centrality and scale of the motif, set against simple bands of varying yellow-golden tones, presents the wheat sheaf almost as a surrogate figure

06009-parents.jpg	This unusual double portrait is a perfect profile representation of Jan de Bray's father, Salomon, who looks to the left and raises his hand in what seems to be a rhetorical gesture. Directly behind him and also in profile is his wife and Jan's mother, Anna Westerbaen. They married in 1625. Anna Westerbaen was the sister of the physician and poet Jacob Westerbaen and the Hague portraitist Jan Westerbaen. She died in the plague epidemic that ravaged Haarlem in 1663 and 1664; she was buried in the St Bavokerk on 3 March 1663. Salomon died a year later and was buried in the same grave as his wife.Salomon and Anna also feature in other painting by Jan de Bray such as the The Banquet of Antony and Cleopatra

07558-41baptis.jpg	In around 1605 Caravaggio dealt with St John the Baptist in two splendid compositions, one in the Kansas City Gallery, the other in the Galleria Nazionale di Arte Antica in Rome. The former is laid out vertically, the latter horizontally. Both lend themselves to a modernistic reading aimed at pointing out a certain air between contempt and arrogance. In effect what we are dealing with here are splendid exercises in modeling the body through the play of light and shadow.In the version now in Kansas City, the figure is set before a dense curtain of plants; in that in Rome, there is only the trunk of a cypress tree, on the left. Both are admirable feats of painting, and it is understandable that collectors competed with each other for the artist's works. Caravaggio in turn knew how to make apparently uninteresting religious themes into paintings desirable even for his aristocratic patrons

39568-06gipsy.jpg	The first and best known of an early series of Madonnas in a landscape setting is the Gypsy Madonna. This painting got its name from the black hair and pale face of the Madonna, as well as the charming contrast of colours. This type of Madonna, with very dark eyes, is not found in Titian's later works. In contrast to the remoter Madonnas of Giovanni Bellini, the Gypsy Madonna has a radiating warmth, an expansive physicality, but the composition still derives from a Bellini prototype. In the Bellini, the child faces directly out, and X-rays show this was originally the case with the Titian. They also demonstrate how Titian adhered to the Giorgionesque practice of making radical changes during the painting process. This differed from earlier generations of Venetian artists and central Italian artists, who were more likely to have worked everything out beforehand in preparatory drawings or underdrawing on the support and less likely to make major alterations after starting to paint

34191-jerome_a.jpg	"This painting was executed for Santa Trinit&#224; delle Monache. The immediate source is Ribera's own print of 1621, which has been altered to heighten the dramatic impact of the angel, who rouses the saint from his studies by sounding the trumpet of the Last Judgment. More important is the level of technical maturity, as evinced in the richly textured brushwork that enlivens every square millimetre of the surface. The powerful contrast of light and shadow produces what contemporary theorists most admired about Ribera's painting - his ""relievo,"" that ability to make two-dimensional objects seem as if they were projecting outward from the canvas. The brilliant red drapery over the saint's leg also provides the composition with an electrifying accent"

25948-flora1.jpg	The model for this painting, formerly thought to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci, was believed to be a lady from the retinue of King Francis I, Leonardo's last patron. It is now known to have been painted by Francesco Melzi, Leonardo's favourite pupil. Flora, the ancient goddess of vegetation, is depicted with flowers executed with the pedantic precision characteristic of Leonardo's school. Included are symbolic flowers: fragrant jasmine in the right hand speaks of lost chastity; the columbine on which the goddess gazes and her bare breast represent fertility; and the anemones in her lap indicate a return to new life.The painting of the Roman goddess of flowers, Flora, is directly connected to the Berlin painting of Pomona and Vertumnus. Both reflect the same model by Leonardo, namely the figure of Mary in the Burlington House Cartoon. The painting appears to have remained in the royal collection in France, at least until the mid-16th century. It is possible that a cartoon of the half-length figure also existed, for in addition to some copies at least two almost identical versions of the painting still exist

The work, rich in anecdotal details and offering enigmas aplenty, is the most famous treatment of this traditional subject. With his depiction of a quacksalver, Dou was partaking in a long tradition reaching back to Hieronymus Bosch and Lucas van Leyden. The subject was still popular in Dou's time, as evidenced by paintings by Adriaen van Ostade, Jan Steen, Frans van Mieris, and Adriaen van de Venne

17742-309goya.jpg	While he was recovering from the serious illness that left him totally deaf, Goya occupied himself with a series of 'cabinet' paintings which he sent to the Academy and which won approval as scenes of 'national pastimes'. A few days later, he followed these with a twelfth painting of a very different character, which he described in detail in a letter to the Director. The rediscovery of this picture in 1967 provided a touchstone for the identification of the rest of the set of cabinet pictures that Goya had sent to the Academy which are now considered to include subjects such as a Shipwreck and a Fire hardly to be described as national pastimes as well as Strolling Players, and possibly a group of Bullfight scenes.The Madhouse and other small paintings now in the Academy, once thought to have been among the scenes of so-called national pastimes are now generally attributed to a considerably later date, for stylistic reasons. The Yard of a Madhouse is one of many scenes Goya recorded that he had actually witnessed, among them some of the war scenes in the Desastres (with the titles 'I saw this' and 'this too'). Many of his etchings and drawings testify to his concern for the plight of lunatics and prisoners throughout his life. See, for instance, the drawing of a madman behind bars made in Bordeaux

05376-flower_p.jpg	The subject of flowers in vases, closely linked with the still-life, has its origins in the art of the Middle Ages, in which flowers were frequently depicted within religious paintings, sometimes with symbolic meaning. Their considerable decorative value meant that they were still used in Renaissance art, but it was only in the 17th century that a separate genre of flower painting developed. In Holland it developed parallel to so-called genre painting - scenes of daily life, landscapes and still-lifes - and was the domain of specialist painters such as Bosschaert.This painting depicts a bouquet, placed in a dark background, which consists of a columbine, tulips and a peony

20108-43hooch.jpg	"In this work de Hooch leant heavily on the influence of Vermeer and the Rembrandt student Carel Fabritius. Although a certain tendency towards sumptuous interiors and elegant society is already evident here, the compositional organization is charming, and the architecture of the room with its checkerboard tiles heightening the sense of depth and perspective, is rendered with painstaking precision.When de Hooch moved to Amsterdam where he moved in high circles, his interiors became increasingly elegant, and his simple ""households"" were gradually replaced by palatial interiors. At the same time, the portrayal began to lose its precision and the vitality of the Dutch genre painting began to fade.His paintings also began to lose the strong colour values so aptly described by Eugï¿½ne Fromentin, a 19th century painter as follows: ""The subtlety of Metsu and the enigma of Pieter de Hooch depend on there being much more air around the objects, shadow around the light, stability in volatile colours, blending of hues, pure invention in the portrayal of things, in a word: the most wonderful handling of light and shade there has ever been . . ."

Only thirty years after its completion in 1878 was it entitled The Four Ages of Man. On panel, using the old-fashioned tempera medium, the scene is set in the Garden of the Hesperides - a pagan Paradise -  where nymphs guard trees bearing the golden apples, wedding gifts to Hera.

The woman is grinding spices with a pestle and mortar - there is a rolled-up bag full of cloves on the table in front of her - to improve the flavour of the vegetables (artichokes, asparagus and red turnips) and the different roasts. The artist's macabre sense of humour prompted him to depict the rabbit (on the left), both paws stretched out and flexed, as if with rigor mortis. Desserts have been placed on the shelf at the back, including a pie, lemons (one of them halved), a china bowl with strawberries and a bulging greenish jug which matches the two glasses with knob handles, hardly noticeable against the dark background

43769-07cythe1.jpg	This picture was Watteau's diploma piece for the Acadï¿½mie royal de Peinture et de Sculpture. Watteau's nomination was accepted by the Acadï¿½mie in 1712, but he had to be called to order several times and in 1717 he was given six months to execute his reception piece. He was received on presentation of his picture.Love is a traditional theme of French poetry since the Middle Ages. From the beginning of the 18th century, the idea of departure for Cythera recurs in numerous ballets and operas.The handle of the paint in scumbles and glazes, thinly applied, with very little impasto, is close to that of Rubens in his final period. Watteau was able to study his style of painting in the royal collection. Even the subject is derived from Rubens' Jardin d'Amour. Moreover, Watteau made a very close study of the Rubens painting in the Galerie Mï¿½dicis. There are also reminiscences of Italy in this enchanted land; the general atmosphere of the painting is Venetian, and the distant mountains in their blue haze recall Leonardo.

41994-fortunte.jpg	The most original tavern scenes of the Caravaggesque painters are those by Valentin. He participated vigorously in the tavern life of Rome, enjoying the company of notoriously rowdy Flemish artists. Throughout the 1620s, in his increasingly ambitious compositions, whose figures are often linked in a deep space by bold diagonals, Valentin deepened the menacing atmosphere of inn and guardhouse. And most strikingly, he developed a sense of melancholy.In the Fortune Teller the mood is urgent, with dark undercurrents, and the soldier on the right raises his glass to the spectator, in a melancholy invitation to mistrust the future, and seize the pleasure of the passing moment

41741-3agapit4.jpg	Two double-sided panels, one depicting scenes from the life of St Agapitus of Praeneste, and another depicting scenes from the life of St Remigius (Remi), bishop of Reims, must originally have formed the folding wings of an altarpiece. The lost altarpiece probably had another pair of folding wings.Saint Remigius (Remi or Rï¿½my), was Bishop of Reims and Apostle of the Franks (c. 437-533 AD). On 25 December 496 he baptised Clovis I, King of the Franks. This baptism, leading to the conversion of the entire Frankish people to Catholic Christianity, was a momentous success for the Church and a seminal event in European history.The first scene on this panel depicts an episode from the saint's life in which he caused a matron's empty barrel of wine to overflow by blessing it with the sign of the cross. The scene on the other side is a later event from Remigius's legend. Foreseeing a poor harvest, he filled a barn with a store of wheat, only to discover later that a group of drunken peasants set fire to the provisions.Comparison with other existing panels from workshops in northern Switzerland indicates that the panels were originated in that region

09601-basket.jpg	If Correggio's mythologies seem to anticipate the boudoir decorations of the eighteenth century, this ravishing tiny picture prefigures developments in seventeenth-century religious sentiment and imagery. Indeed, it may have directly affected them through drawn and engraved copies.In this painting Correggio turns the theme of Holy Family into an idyll of innocence, of maternal and filial love. The scene is suffused with tenderness. Sitting outdoors under a tree, the Virgin, workbasket at her side, is trying a jacket she has just made on the Christ Child. He wriggles on her lap, reaching for the sun-dappled leaves. Mary is dressed in old rose, and the painting is dominated by the soft harmony of grey-pinks and grey-blues. In the background, pale as if in a haze of dust in the sunshine, Joseph is working with a carpenter's plane. Their ramshackle home has been built abutting on grandiose ruins. The twisting, complex pose of the Virgin, the extreme foreshortening of the Child's leg and groin, are made to seem effortless. Correggio's famous 'softness', the gradual transitions from shadow to light which he learned from Leonardo's Milanese works, but interpreted through a golden prism of Venetian colour, casts a seductive veil over the figures. Even though the scale of the picture invites close inspection, and the Virgin and Child are near to us, we cannot quite see them sharply in the blur and shimmer of the painter's brush

00219-apocaly2.jpg	Even more in the four minor panels of the Polyptych of the Apocalypse the transcendental significance of the gold background pales before the freshness and inventiveness of Jacobello Alberegno's imagination. As with the other scenes, so with the 'Harvest of the World', the text of the Book of the Apocalypse (XIII, vv. 17-18) is closely followed: 'And another angel came out of the temple... and he too had a sharpened sickle. And another angel came out from the altar... saying: wield your sharpened sickle and harvest the grapes of the world, for the fruit is now ripe'. The detailed and penetrating transcription of the sacred text into pictorial form seems to be softened by the enchanting addition of an arbour of black grapes with bunches of the fruit hanging heavy with juice and leaves which are already showing signs that Autumn is drawing to a close

11707-lanton_j.jpg	Jï¿½nos Donï¿½t was a typical exponent of Viennese Academic painting, which exerted a profound influence on Hungarian art for a considerable period of time. He was already an elderly man when he moved to Hungary. Donï¿½th became a friend of the writer Ferenc Kazinczy, a leading figure of the Hungarian Enlightenment, and it was his recommendations that opened the way for Donï¿½t to became one of the most popular portrait painters of the 1810s and 1820s, one of the great periods of portrait painting among the nobility and the higher circles of the bourgeoisie. Donï¿½t also produced altarpieces and mythological compositions.Woman Playing the Lute well represents his reliable, a little too tediously executed, Neo-Classicist portrayals, in which the personality of the model is barely captured; instead, the painter seems to have been taking more enjoyment in idealizing his models. He did not strive for the kind of representation typical of Baroque paintings; instead, his portraits were much more characterized by a certain detached decorativity.

21498-certosa2.jpg	The ten compartments of the nave vault contain a rich pictorial program. It is centred on the Ascension of Christ which is distributed across three panels treated as glimpses into heaven: a choir of angels, the ascending Christ, and God the Father. The continuous blue background suggests a unified space extending above massive, three-dimensional framing of the ribs. The three-part centre sequence is framed by seven vault caps in which numerous Old Testament can be seen in loose groupings, some lounging on clouds, some seated on the painted frames or cut off by them. The most prominent of these is a youth reminiscent of Michelangelo's Jonah from the Sistine Ceiling. He represents Abel (at the bottom of the present photo), who as the first murdered human was also the first to glimpse the glory of Paradise

35121-selfport.jpg	Salvator Rosa, who was active predominantly in Rome and Florence, was one of the most versatile and idiosyncratic artists of the 17th century. He used - and also criticized - every linguistic means for this appeal. He was a painter, engraver, poet, actor and musician in one. In about 1641 he painted his self-portrait.Standing out against a sky whose colours are threatening, we see the dark silhouette of a three-quarter-length figure in a reddish-brown coat, holding in his right hand a tablet with an inscription: Aut tace / Aut Loquere meliora / silentio (Either be silent or say something better than silence). This inscription is a message urging us to keep silent, unless we really and truly have something to say which is better than silence. This challenging maxim, which Rosa had borrowed from classical aphorisms, is matched by a head inclined in melancholy fashion to one side, the eyes staring at the beholder with a penetrating gaze from beneath a black cap. Because the face with the energetically tight lips is only illuminated from one side, in the expression of the surly man is reflected the depression which also keeps the tension between the figure and the light of the sky

04122-paulbarn.jpg	In the course of their missionary journeys the apostles Paul and Barnabas arrived at Lystra in Asia Minor. The pagan inhabitants, witnessing the miraculous cure of a cripple by Paul and Barnabas, believed that they were Mercury and Jupiter come to earth in human form. When the priest of the temple of Jupiter brought oxen and garlands to make a sacrifice the apostles rent their clothes in dismay. By their exhortations they prevented the sacrifice taking place.In Berchem's painting the sacrificial ritual occupies the entire foreground of the painting. The fire burns on the altar emitting clouds of smoke. The priest and his stewards stand beside it, guarding a cow and a goat with garlands around their necks. The priest makes a proffering gesture to the two apostles, one of whom remonstrates with him, while the other rents his garments. They stand side by side on a high pedestal.

It is difficult to perceive the hand of the artist in the face which, although beautifully drawn, lacks the physiognomic characteristics which typify Raphael's subjects. But the overall attention to the analytical effects of Flemish art leads us to attribute the work to Raphael, since his attention was turned to the production of this school precisely in these years. Furthermore, the compositional harmony which is a principal element of Raphael's art is visible in the compact forms of the solidly conceived portrait.The subject has been associated with Francesco Maria Della Rovere, and possibly correctly: the portrait reached Florence with the Della Rovere patrimony in 1631 on the marriage of Vittoria Della Rovere to the future Grand Duke Ferdinand II

02868-depositi.jpg	Bachiacca belongs to that group of minor artists, of popular temperament and background, part-craftsmen, part-artists, free bizarre spirits in the best Florentine tradition, who in the full flowering of the sixteenth century somehow succeeded in prolonging the naturalistic tradition of Tuscan art.This work, however youthful, shows the interest which the artist nurtured for the painting of landscape. The whole composition - besides being balanced and almost symmetrically divided by the ladders, the crosses and the group of figures - is in fact set in a rural landscape which serves not only as a background to the scene, but is the natural continuation and development of the grassy terrain in the foreground

04479-procurat.jpg	With the Peace of Bratislava (1805), Venice was incorporated into the French Empire. It was decided that a new sovereign's residence was required for Napoleon and the viceroy, Eugï¿½ne de Beauharnais. Once the idea of converting the Palazzo Ducale had been abandoned, the notion was mooted to use the Procuratie Nuove and the Libreria Marciana for this purpose.The interiors of the nearby Procuratie Vecchie, privately owned, were also restored during this period. Here Giuseppe Borsato, Giovanni Carlo Bevilacqua, and the less well-known Pietro Moro were employed by the old aristocracy as well as by new bourgeois clients.The picture shows a scene on one of the walls of the reception rooms in the Procuratie Vecchie

33243-vertumnu.jpg	Pomona, the classical goddess of fruit, and Vertumnus, the god of transformation, are the main figures in an episode in Ovid's Metamorphoses which is depicted here. Vertumnus enters Pomona's grove in order to convince her of his love. Because she had always run away on previous occasions when he came, he has cunningly dressed as an old woman on this occasion. By telling her about the allegory of the grapevine and elm, he is able to convince her of the importance of togetherness, for the grapevine needs something it can climb up and the elm, when considered on its own, is useless. Persuaded, Pomona gives in to love and her innermost longings and they become a couple.The work was painted by the Montpellier-born artist shortly before his departure for Spain, where he developed a successful, life-long career as a portrait painter. Ranc's training as a portrait painter is certainly apparent in the delicate treatment of the faces of his subjects and, more so, in the exquisitely rendered fabrics. The painting is also significant for the manner in which it presents a mythological narrative and its moral subtext in an entirely contemporary manner, as indicated in Pomona's radiant, silky dress and parasol

42383-livorno.jpg	Willem van de Velde the Elder specialised in pen paintings - scenes drawn with the pen on a support prepared with a white ground. In his early years he drew naval battles and ship portraits with the pen on vellum. When he began to find that support too cramped he developed a similar technique for canvas and panel, producing works which most closely resemble paintings in black and white, with the difference that they were done not with a brush but with the pen alone. He was particularly sought after by senior naval officers keen to have a memento of a victory at sea.This painting was probably ordered by Cornelis Tromp who played a key role in the Battle of Livorno. The naval battle took place on 14 March 1653, during the First Anglo-Dutch War, near Leghorn (Livorno), Italy. It was a victory of a Dutch fleet under Commodore Johan van Galen over an English squadron under Captain Henry Appleton.The painting is in a frame of ebony veneer with gilt appliquï¿½s

39797-20gritti.jpg	Titian's portraits provide a gallery of the leading aristocrats of Italy. Most of these works are essentially idealized state portraits, although the heads are very convincingly rendered. Doge Andrea Gritti is to a greater extent a symbol of the office - that is, that of ruler of Venice. The gigantic body in a canvas of large size is sweeping in design and commanding in presence.The fine harmony of the reds and golds, and the upward sweep from the bottom left of the open brocade cloak, whose strong lines end at the top of the Doge's hat, give this painting a sense of power and glory. The Doge's severe gaze, signaling his strength and determination, deepen this impression. For stylistic reasons it is nowadays assumed that this portrait was not painted until about 1545, long after Gritti's death in 1538

37912-morningt.jpg	The girl is shown in a state of undress, provocatively pulling on her stocking and looking directly - and invitingly - at the spectator. The erotic character of this delicately painted and boldly coloured panel cannot be doubted. It has been argued that she is probably a prostitute - above the arch is Cupid and beside her bed a jewel-case - and yet the scene, framed in an archway, gives few real clues as to her status. We may, in fact, simply be glimpsing a desirable young woman at her toilet. The lute and the music book in the archway (as well as Cupid) associate the scene with the pleasures of love, while the skull wreathed in vine leaves reminds us that such pleasures are fleeting. The chamber pot is a characteristically realistic and down-to-earth element, while the archway with its Corinthian columns and swags of flowers frames this all-too-human scene in a mock grandiose manner.Today we may admire not just the illusionism, the amusing conceit of the subject but also the remarkable skill with which Steen described the rush-carpet, the canopied bed, the tiled floor and all the other details which go to make up this rich and intricate composition

06150-the_port.jpg	"Antwerp-born Paul Bril set up his studio in Rome in 1582, where a brilliant career awaited him. Considered one of the best landscape painters of his time, he worked for a series of important patrons, including Popes Gregory XIII, Sixtus V and Clement VII, and Cardinals Scipio Borghese and Federico Borromeo, also the protector of Jan ""Velvet"" Brueghel. The prestige Bril enjoyed is also attested by his titles of Principe (1620) and of Secondo Consigliere (1623), attributed for the first time to a landscape painter and to a foreigner by the highly reputed Accademia di San Luca.Bril's seascapes, easel paintings of his mature period, are among his most innovative paintings. Among them this Port, whilst retaining the elevated vantage point typical of the Flemish tradition, offers a unified vision of space of rare amplitude. The composition is no longer based on divergent planes, but is constructed on perspective lines that start from the left and converge towards a vanishing point on the far right-hand horizon. This focal point is also the source of an intense light which, reflecting on the tranquil water, confers a particular serenity to the work. It is the end of the day: in the foreground, sailors and boats are silhouetted against this sunset that is so typical of the Mediterranean. However, this is an imaginary bay, in an idyllic evocation of the open sea. Indeed it is unlikely that vessels of the size of a caravel would moor against such a rocky shore. It has also been observed that the masts are too high and the bowspit too long. But it is precisely these verticals, against the clear sky and sea, that give the painting its balance.With their perfect synthesis of Flemish and Italian elements, Bril's seascapes deeply impressed his contemporaries. Papal superintendent Giovan Battista Crescenzi, as well as Federico Borromeo, Scipio Borghese and Carlo de' Medici all commissioned port views from the artist. These views were also to strongly influence several generations of painters, among them Claude Lorrain, a drawing of whose, taken from his famous Liber Veritatis and conserved at the British Museum in London, closely follows the Brussels seascape. This grand master of French landscape painting was, moreover, the pupil of Agostino Tassi, who himself learned his trade from Paul Bril"

18050-02scene.jpg	"The fresco with St Augustine at the University of Carthage  has been severely damaged. St Augustine is kneeling on the right side in front of two seated scholars. Between them, in the background, appear two youthful figures framed by a classical pediment portal.In 371 St Augustine went to the University of Carthage in order to study the liberal arts. These can be subdivided into the trivium of grammar, rhetoric and logic, and the quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. In his encyclopaedia work ""Satiricon"" (ca. 450), Marcianus Capella stated that there were seven liberal arts. In Carthage, Augustine became familiar with Cicero's philosophical treatise ""Hortensius'; and this led to his first conversion, when he adhered to Manichaeism. This was a dualistic philosophy founded by the Persian Mani (216-273), which comprised the battle between light and darkness, between good and evil.In the two first pictures, the School of Tagaste and the University of Carthage, the figural scenes appear within a perspectively painted architecture typical of the Early Renaissance. In contrast to Montefalco, the figures and architecture here form a harmonious whole"

10303-01luthe1.jpg	Hans Luther (1459-1530), the father of Martin Luther, was the eldest son of a farming family from Mï¿½hra near Eisenach. After the birth of his eldest son he moved from Eisleben to nearby Mansfeld, where he ran a copper works which he made modestly prosperous. His wife Margaretha (1460-1531) came from Eisenach, and after the birth of the future reformer brought at least eight more children into the world.In 1527 the couple visited their son, now famous, in Wittenberg.

05547-04medal.jpg	Datable soon after 1470. By this time the language of Botticelli under the inspiration of Pollaiolo has become more precise, and through the vibration of the line, expresses a tense inquietude of spirit.The picture of this unidentified young man is one of the most unusual portraits of the Early Renaissance. The man is gazing at the observer and holding up a medal bearing the profile of the head of Cosimo de' Medici, who died in 1464. Botticelli set the medal into the painting as a gilded plaster cast.The painting is a a half length portrait in front of an extensive light landscape with a river, and the man's head projects above the horizon. The light, which falls on the subject from the left, clearly shapes his striking features, and there are stronger shadows on the side of his face closer to the observer. The poor drawing of his hands makes the experimental nature of this portrait more than clear. It is one of the earliest Italian portraits to make the hands a part of the portrait's theme.The commemorative medal of Cosimo dates from about 1465-70 and has given rise to an entire series of suggestions concerning the identity of the man depicted. So far it has not been possible to give a definitive answer to the question whether this is a close relative or supporter of the Medicis, or perhaps the man who created the medal

12518-1jabach2.jpg	The panel is a wing of the Jabach Altarpiece, named after one of its previous owners. Originally, however, it was commissioned by Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony. Another panel in Frankfurt, depicting Job and his wife, belongs to this altar, too. It is conceivable that these two pictures are the results of sawing a larger one in two. Even though their conditions differ, it is clearly visible that the background and the horizon in both pictures match, and portions of the clothes of Job's wife may be found in the picture of the two musicians. There is even a sixteenth-century drawing which shows the two paintings as one composition. The two pictures together may have constituted the centre panel of a Job altar commissioned by Frederick the Wise to commemorate the plague which ravaged the German lands in 1503.It should be noted that there are scholars who have proposed that these two pictures used to form the two wing-panels of a triptych showing the Adoration of the Magi (now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence).The altar, besides depicting Job as the patron saint of people suffering skin diseases, also points to his connection with music. On the first part of the painting we see the suffering Job cowering on a refuse heap while his wife drenches him with water. On the second part, the musicians are certainly the representatives of healing music. (The young drummer bears striking resemblance to the painter). According to the medieval melotherapy, Job, who was devoted to music when he was healthy, should recover upon hearing the melody.The presence of a wind instrument, a type of trumpet, may suggest another association. In praise of the instruments, St Augustine likened the brazen tone of the trumpet to the steadfastness of Job.

44062-3entombm.jpg	It is believed - but without absolute certainty - that this Entombment is the centre of a polyptych which was acquired by Leonello d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, for the Study at Belfiore, when the painter went in pilgrimage to Rome in 1449, the year before the Jubilee. It is however more probable that this work - which is also mentioned as being in the Medicean Villa at Careggi - was done in 1449-50 at Florence, because it derives its compositive formula from the Deposition by Fra Angelico which can be seen in the predella of the altarpiece of St Mark in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich.This painting, in a Renaissance frame decorated with pilasters, adorned the altar of the private chapel of the Medici villa in Careggi, near Florence. Cosimo de' Medici (1389 -1464) had built this country residence around the middle of the century, and there are good reasons to suppose that the Medici family, who must have owned Rogier's small panel of the Madonna (St&#228;delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt), also commissioned the larger painting.The work closely follows the Entombment of Christ which was part of an altarpiece by Fra Angelico, painted around 1440 for the Florentine monastery church of San Marco. Its influence is evident in the display of the dead man, shown almost standing, with Mary and John holding his arms one on each side, and more particularly in the hill with the tomb in the rock, which runs entirely counter to Northern European tradition. Fra Angelico's altarpiece, to which the picture of the Entombment, much imitated in Florence, also belonged, was itself an important donation by the Medici family.It is improbable that Rogier van der Weyden saw Fra Angelico's work by chance on his Italian journey, and then reworked it for his own Medici altarpiece - particularly as we do not know whether he passed through Florence at all on his way to Rome.The model was more probably prescribed for him by his patrons when the work was commissioned. Very likely they sent the master a sketch of the work they had donated, telling him to follow it. Such clear guidelines from Florence would also explain why the painting was executed in almost square format, unusual for Netherlandish works but common in Italy and suitable for the architectural Renaissance setting.The patrons who commissioned the work will have been as much struck by the fine, realistic detail of the painting of the Lamentation as by the intense emotion of the faces. These qualities, and the slight asymmetry that suited late Gothic taste, distinguish the picture in significant respects from the work of Fra Angelico. A two-dimensionality at least matching that of the St John Altarpiece (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), and not at all in line with the artistic ideals of the Renaissance, is particularly noticeable in the Magdalene kneeling at the front, her limbs compressed into the same plane. The painting can thus be associated with Rogier's late works coming after the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich)

26135-36ursu05.jpg	5. Martyrdom in CologneScenes 5 and 6 form a continuous whole, and are enacted upon the eastern bank of the Rhine. The Roman rulers, who wished to snuff out this escalation in the practice of the Christian faith, called upon their relative Julius, leader of the Huns, to await the pilgrims in Cologne and to put them to death. The attack begins in the distance on the opposite bank, shown on the extreme left (the ship being fired upon is the one in the far right background of the previous panel). The massacre on board the two ships is depicted in the foreground. Etherius is stabbed to death in Ursula's arms.The king of the Huns, meanwhile, takes a fancy to Ursula, but when she fails to respond to his advances he shoots her dead with an arrow. It is difficult to identify the other characters depicted in this final panel. A woman and an older man standing behind Ursula witness her execution with intense sympathy. They are clearly citizens of Bruges, and unconnected with the legendary company. Perhaps they were involved in the ordering of the shrine. The turbaned figure is another odd presence. Memling, and other painters of his era, often portrayed Old Testament kings or Roman emperors in this manner. He might thus be one of the Roman potentates, unless he is the king of the Huns who makes known his feelings for Ursula with a gesture of his hand.The townscape features, from left to right, the Bayenturm, St Severin's, with the towers of St Maria Lyskirchen before it, St Maria im Kapitol, Gross St Martin and the Cathedral

18327-1301grec.jpg	On 9 November 1597, El Greco signed a contract to execute a series of paintings for the newly built Capilla de San Jose (Chapel of Saint Joseph), Toledo. The contract specified that El Greco was to paint the altarpieces himself and design and gild the frames. The centrepiece of the decorative scheme was to be a painting of Saint Joseph and the Infant Christ with The Coronation of the Virgin above it. These two paintings, set in an altarpiece in a Palladian style designed by El Greco, though its surroundings were altered by Baroque additions around 1665, are still in situ; recent cleaning has revealed their masterly quality. In addition, El Greco was commissioned to paint two side altarpieces, Saint Martin and the Beggar hung on the left-hand side of the main altar, while The Virgin and Child with Saints Martina and Agnes was placed directly opposite, on the right-hand side of the altar, where they remained until they were sold in 1906 to the American collector Peter A. B. Widener, from his estate they entered the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1942.The chapel was consecrated on 24 December 1594. At a later date, two sarcophagi were placed on either side of the main altar. Possibly designed by El Greco or his son Jorge Manuel, they are similar in design to the ark and the obelisk with a ball on top that appear in the background of El Greco's late Purification of the Temple from San Ginï¿½s. Martï¿½n Ramï¿½rez was buried to the left of the altar while Diego Ortï¿½z and his wife were placed to the right, in each case with a plaque above stating that they were co-founders of the chapel. The two sculptures of David and Salomon, situated on either side of the main altar was possibly also designed by El Greco

14445-210fried.jpg	"The painting was painted in recollection of the artist's honeymoon. We may assume that the figures are the painter, his wife, and his brother Christian. Again a double meaning is apparent, and the first impression of light and happiness is counteracted on a closer inspection. The three have ventured right up to the edge of the precipice. The man on the right is relying on the bush to prevent him from falling, while the woman is securing her hold by sitting down, and is also clutching a bush while she points down. The oddest figure is the painter himself; his hat seems to have fallen in the grass or been tossed down in haste. He has crawled to the edge, felling his way carefully, as if wishing to plumb the dizzying depth into which his companion is pointing. The double meaning between recollected experience and the ""profound depth"" of the symbols of life is evident. The view of the sea with the two sailing boats looks like a chasm that has opened beneath the figures, framed by the cliffs and the intertwining tops of the tress.With this daring construction Friedrich has succeeded in making a visual combination of two extremes: the plunging ravine with its view of the sea and at the same time the endless horizon"

15455-2obsequ.jpg	For her obsequies, in stark contrast, the beautiful saint is lying not on her wooden bed, but on a rich cloth and pillow in front of the altar. The living flowers have been changed into gold brocade that is shining on the black and dark turquoise cloth. Let us follow the inscription on her grave and look for the miracles depicted on the walls. Because the old nurse had held Fina's head for so long, her arms became paralysed. Now, kneeling behind the bier in the centre of the scene, she is healed by the touch of Saint Fina's hands. Another healing is taking place at the feet of the dead woman. Here, a blind boy regains his sight by touching his eyes to the saint's feet. A third miracle is taking place in the background on the left, where an angel has appeared to ring the death knell.The painted pilasters that flanked the front pictorial zone of Ghirlandaio's early works are now integrated into the background of the picture as parts of a monumental sacred architecture. Behind the scene is an apse, which harmonizes with the chapel wall's tympanum at the top, and which also guides our eyes back to the centre of the scene. The vanishing point in this composition is the altar cross-flanked by two candles. Ghirlandaio would have found models for this architecture, which skillfully uses colourful marble, in the monumental tombs of his age - such as the work of Bernardo Rossellino in the church of Santa Croce in Florence. The immediate inspiration for the composition, however, was Fra Filippo Lippi's fresco in the choir of Prato Cathedral, the Obsequies of Saint Stephen. Ghirlandaio would later create another variation on this composition in a fresco for the Sassetti Chapel in Florence

24584-flora.jpg	Jan Massys, the eldest son of Quentin Massys, painted Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers in 1559. As if bestowing her blessing of fertility, she holds three carnations above a landscape highlighted by the skyline of Antwerp. The red and white blooms allude to the city's colours. The spires of the cathedral and,, by her elbow, the abbey of St Michael are visible. Closer examination reveals that the river Scheldt is filled with ships, ranging from seagoing galleys to smaller vessels capable of navigating the region's canals and rivers. Flora sits in a garden of a suburban villa.Massys's picture is an allegory of Antwerp's prosperity and peace. Massy showed the city at its economic and artistic peak just before the political and religious troubles of the mid-1560s and 1570s. He alluded too to the city's artistic sophistication. The voluptuous goddess was  inspired by the nudes of the Fontainebleau school. Flora's pose, however, mimics the Sleeping Ariadne, a second-century Roman statue in the Vatican.The panoramic vista may have been executed by Jan's younger brother, Cornelis, who specialized in landscapes, just as Jan favoured figure painting

23355-15lucy.jpg	"The picture shows the central panel of the St Lucy Altarpiece. The altarpiece was commissioned by the Confraternity of Santa Lucia of Iesi in 1523, however, the execution started only in 1528 and ended in 1532. The predella was constituted by three panels, from left to right: St Lucy at the Tomb of St Agatha; St Lucy before Paschasius and St Lucy Harnessed to Oxen; Teams of Oxen. The altarpiece was placed in the church of St Florian at Iesi, and it was transferred to the museum in 1861 (both the main panel and the predella panels).Now over fifty years old, Lotto tended to tone down the bright colours with a dimmer gradation of light. The scene is depicted through various minor episodes, but the narration is brought alive, above all, by the interior pathos of the  protagonists, who are all characterised with great sentimental acuity.Unusual for the period, the main panel of the altarpiece shows not a timeless group of saints, nor even a scene from the life of Christ or the Virgin Mary, but an episode in the life of St Lucy belonging to the same narrative sequence as the scenes in the predella. In depicting the story Lotto faithfully followed the account given in the Golden Legend, compiled in the late thirteenth century by Jacobus da Voragine, and by the early sixteenth century widely available in Italian translation.The story of St Lucy begins in the left predella panel, in which the future saint, daughter of a noble family in Syracuse, visits the shrine of St Agatha with her mother Euthicia, who for four years has been suffering from an incurable issue of blood.  The two women kneel near an altar during the celebration of mass, during which the priest reads the passage from the gospel describing the miraculous cure by Jesus of the woman suffering from the same affliction as Euthicia. Euthicia prays at the shrine for a similar cure while Lucy, asleep, experiences a vision of St Agatha surrounded by angels. When she awakens, Lucy cures her mother, and begs to be released from her promise to marry, so that she can give away her dowry to the poor. The story in this panel closes with the women distributing alms to beggars in rag.The scene in the first predella panel is set in a Renaissance church, the architectural spaces of which provide distinct areas for the successive events. St Lucy is represented four times, she is identifiable by her yellow robe, red cloak, and laurel crown.The second scene is restricted to a narrow field on the left of the central predella panel, bounded by the green curtain. Lucy's fiancï¿½, enraged by losing her dowry, complained to the Roman consul Paschasius, who now questions Lucy about her religious beliefs and demands that she worship idols. After an angry altercation, Paschasius orders her to be removed to a brothel.The story continues on the main panel of the altarpiece which depicts St Lucy Seized by the Panders. In this scene Paschasius summons the panders to ""invite the crowd to have pleasure with this woman, and let them abuse her body until she dies; but the panders tried to carry her off, the Holy Ghost made her so heavy that they were unable to move her."" At the extreme right, partly cut by the frame, the disappointed fiancï¿½ assists the panders in their fruitless efforts.The story then moves back to the predella where the right-hand section of the central predella panel unites with the right panel, with its atmospheric townscape, to form a single extended scene. Paschasius furiously orders her to dragged away by teams of oxen. Again the Holy Ghost (the white dove) intervenes on Lucy's behalf. The extension of this fourth scene across more than half of the width of the entire predella, represents a highly original approach to predella design. No less than eight teams of powerful oxen are represented in the predella"

03198-annuncix.jpg	Barocci painted this Annunciation for the chapel of his patron, Francesco Maria II della Rovere, duke of Urbino, in the Basilica of Loreto between the years 1582 and 1584. In 1797 the altarpiece was seized by French troops and transferred to Paris, where it remained until 1815. Probably because of damage caused on its journey to Paris, the panel was first placed on a cloth base, but since this proved too light in weight, it became necessary to transfer it onto a stronger canvas.Many copies of the painting are known to exist, they were produced by re-utilization of the same preparatory drawing, either by Barocci himself or by his workshop

24617-canon.jpg	Massys here demonstrates his confident abilities as a portrait painter. The canon calmly surveys the outside world, but his thoughts seem to be turned inwards. Sebastiano del Piombo's more or less contemporaneous portrait of Cardinal Carondelet and his Secretary offers an interesting comparison in this respect. The Cardinal observes the external world with cool, calculating eyes, but without the kindliness suggested by Massys' canon. The secularity of Carondelet and his setting is diametrically opposed to the personality of the canon, rooted in the Christian faith.In his composition, Massys achieves a homogeneity and grandeur only rarely paralleled in his oeuvre. The half length figure is contained within the approximate volume of a pyramid, dominating the pictorial field. Massys avoids any sense of rigidity, however, by slightly offsetting the sitter to the left of the central axis and by showing his head slightly turned.The sensitive handling of paint evidenced in the iridescent hues of the cape and in the light and shade which model the head is on an equal par with contemporary Venetian painting, which Massys would probably not have known. There is a melodious harmony, too, in the relationship between figure and landscape. From a slightly elevated standpoint, we look out across a broad expanse of hills and meadows towards the hazy distant mountains. Nature is filled with the same quiet calm as the canon himself

21495-apostoli.jpg	The new church type, developed in the Baroque period, offered large format vertical picture surfaces on the inner faï¿½ade and on the dividing wall between the nave and the choir, which were used both for oil paintings and for frescoes. It was not as easy to see the pictures on the inner faï¿½ade because of the light from the windows, yet it was costumary to incorporate these surfaces into the iconographic program. The most magnificent solutions for this space were found in Naples, an example being Lanfranco's The Healing of the Cripple at the Pool of Bethesda on the entrance wall of the church of Santi Apostoli. This fresco was executed in collaboration with the quadratura painter Viviano Codazzi

40144-sea_view.jpg	Antonio Travi succeeded in distinctively linking local tradition and Northern culture, especially that of Goffredo Wals, whose presence in Genoa is documented from November 1623, and whose cold, precise light he emulated. The small scenes animating his landscapes follow the path laid by the narrative, naturalist paintings by Filippo Napoletano, and Travi also drew inspiration from the picturesque landscapes of Agostino Tassi, a Roman artist active in Genoa in about 1605-06 while exiled in Livorno between 1600 and 1610.

04741-emmaus.jpg	"Fortified by a religious tradition reaching back to the Middle Ages, a large Catholic community continued to exist at Utrecht inside the primarily Protestant Northern Low Countries of the 16th and 17th centuries. Although officially banned, the Catholic cult was tolerated there away from public view. Abraham Bloemaert, himself a devout Catholic, set up shop in Utrecht in 1593, remaining there till his death.For a short period the painter experimented with the possibilities offered by new artistic models from Italy, which he got to know indirectly via the material that his pupils Hendrick ter Brugghen, Gerrit van Honthorst and Dirck van Baburen brought back from their study trips there. This group was influenced in particular by Caravaggio, in terms both of subject and style. Bloemaert combines the key features of this style in The Emmaus Disciples, a painting that forms a high point not only in his own career, but also in that of the school of the Utrecht Caravaggists in general, with the large, half length figures, the individualised figures with a strong sense of emotionality and in particular the use of chiaroscuro, with strong light-dark effects and sharp shadows, produced by introducing a source of minimum light, here two separate, smoking candles. This style was untypical for the Northern Provinces, where a tendency towards the intimate is so clearly visible in almost all other contemporary genres.The tableau presents the biblical scene in which Jesus - in a gesture that refers back to the Last Supper - breaks bread and in so doing confirms his resurrection from the dead to two of his disciples, who had not recognised him until then (Luke 24, 13-35). Two figures in the background represent the same two disciples, despairingly consulting with each other on the road to the village of Emmaus, before meeting the ""stranger"" who was to open their eyes for good. The visible emotional reactions which the revelation causes to the protagonists are seemingly totally lost on a fourth individual, a turbaned server. In terms of content and form this painting represents ""a light shining in the darkness"""

This picture in a certain sense is the negative counterpart of the allegory on peace painted for Charles I, king of England. The message of this painting is exceptionally pessimistic: even love cannot restrain the blind martial brutality  of the Thirty Years War from plunging Europe into mourning and destroying her prosperity.

05258-14carryi.jpg	The iconography of the Passion scenes which Bosch painted during his middle and later years are simpler than that of his earlier paintings, their imagery more easily grasped by the viewer. One such work is the Christ Carrying the Cross in the Palacio Real, Madrid. Christ dominates the foreground, almost crushed beneath the heavy Cross which the elderly Simon of Cyrene struggles to lift from his back. The ugly heads of his executioners rise steeply in a mass towards the left; in the distance, the sorrowing Virgin collapses into the arms of John the Evangelist. Whereas Bosch's earlier composition of this subject in Vienna had been diffuse and primarily narrative, the Madrid version is concentrated, and the way that Christ ignores his captors to look directly at the spectator gives it the quality of a timeless devotional image

This deed secured the legendary Roman lady a place in the series of exemplary females that in European  painting, particularly in court circles, were depicted as examples of virtue.In most paintings of this subject Lucretia is nude, which gives a sly erotic undertone to the situation, but Rembrandt shows her robed to the neck in fine clothes, like the noblewoman she was. In the picture, she has already driven the dagger into herself and has pulled it out, and the blood seeps through her dress. Although her body remains upright she lurches sideways from the hips as she clutches the bell-rope, and her face has the pallor of approaching death.The motif of the hand clasping the tasselled rope, however, is a reminder of the common studio practice whereby a model posing with his or her arm raised would support it by means of a rope or sling

14809-deadchri.jpg	This painting of enormous dramatic impact portrays the dead Christ laid out on the shroud and surrounded by the symbols of the Passion. The theme and the invention are part of a tradition going back to Mantegna's famous painting, known in the sixteenth century through copies and various prints, and revived in the early seventeenth century on numerous occasions. The clearly isolated display of Christ's dead body, without mourners and with the symbols of the Passion visible, explicitly manifests and almost dwells on the religious intent of the painting, unquestionably made for private devotion and reflecting a sensitivity typical of the Counter-Reformation.The painting was attributed for a long time to Annibale Carracci, only recently was put forward the name of Lorenzo Garbieri, a younger artist who had trained in the workshop of Annibale's cousin Ludovico Carracci

10230-1venus04.jpg	The Reclining River Nymph at the Fountain (1518, Leipzig) inaugurated a long series of paintings of Venus, Lucretia, the Graces, the Judgment of Paris, and other subjects that serve as pretexts for the sensuous female nude, in which Cranach appears as a kind of 16th-century Francois Boucher. The naive elegance of these ladies, whose slender, sinuous bodies defy basic principles of anatomy, were clearly to the taste of the German courts and have an enduring charm.

28830-vespers.jpg	The Sicilian Vespers is the name given to the successful rebellion on the island of Sicily that broke out on the Easter of 1282 against the rule of the French/Capetian king Charles I, who had ruled the Kingdom of Sicily since 1266. The massacre of the French  precipitated a French-Aragonese struggle for possession of that kingdom. Its name derives from a riot that took place in a church outside Palermo at the hour of vespers on Easter Monday, March 30, 1282. Peter III of Aragon, Charles's rival for the Neapolitan throne, conspired to raise a rebellion against him in Sicily. The rising broke out prematurely when Sicilians, incensed by Charles's oppressive regime, killed some insulting French soldiers at vespers in the church of Santo Spirito. The people of Palermo followed suit and massacred 2,000 French inhabitants of the city the night of March 30&#150;31. All of Sicily soon revolted and sought help from the Aragonese, who landed at Trapani on August 30.

40775-16icon.jpg	At an early stage, what came to the fore as a valid image of the Trinity in the Eastern Church was a symbolic representation that was known as the philoxenia (hospitality) of Abraham, as it was based on the visit, described in Genesis 18, of three men or angels to Abraham and Sarah. Abraham had a calf slaughtered and entertained the guests, who then promised him that his aging wife Sarah would give birth to their longed-for son. This Old Testament story had already been interpreted by the Fathers of the Church as the first revelation of the three Persons of the Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Ghost).In this icon the three angels are sitting at a richly decked table, on which three chalices, knives, a jug, small loaves and other objects can be seen. Abraham's tent or house is replaced by a richly detailed, colourful town, while on the right loom the three peaks of a mountain on which grow stylised trees

20116-48hooch.jpg	Pieter de Hooch had moved from Delft to Amsterdam by 15 April 1661, when one of his daughters was baptized in the Westerkerk. In his Amsterdam years his domestic interiors became richer and his compositions more complex. His technique becomes progressively cruder and his late paintings often contain clumsy figure drawings and a coarse palette. In a painting such as this one, however, from his early years in Amsterdam, De Hooch applies the delicate technique of his Delft scenes to grander Amsterdam interiors.Here a classical statuette stands over the pilastered doorway and the woman and her maid take clean linen from an ornate 'kast' inlaid with ebony and surmounted by porcelain. In the background a child playfully wields a 'kolf' stick. Paintings such as these accurately show the details of Dutch interiors of the period and it is interesting to see a portrait in an elaborately carved gilt frame hanging alongside a landscape in a simple ebony frame. Through the open door, we can glimpse the buildings on the other side of the canal
