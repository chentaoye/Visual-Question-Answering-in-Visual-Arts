15904-05selfpo.jpg	The still youthful man is wearing his hair shoulder-length. His chin is raised in truculent manner, his mouth energetically shut. We are met by a melancholy gaze emanating from softly shadowed eye-orbits and lightly reddened lids, its intensity stressed by the wrinkles of rage above the root of the nose. While the man's gaze is challenging, he turns his right shoulder towards us. Intensity and dismissive pride create thus a tense contradiction. Also under tension are the physicality and the illumination. Predominantly dark, the space into which hair, throat and chest disappear almost uncontoured does include a few bright spots, but these are very specific: the emotional focus of the duskily modelled face and, above the transitional beige and green of the garment, a brightly shining piece of metal on the shoulder. This man, then, is wearing martial armour. He is, as we have known since Giorgio Vasari's mid-16-century artist biographies, none other than the painter of the picture himself.Giorgio da Castelfranco, known as Giorgione, has a prominent place in the artistic history of Venice, where he worked. Although there is little archive material to tell us much about him personally, he must, like D�rer, be seen as one of the most important innovators on the threshold of the modern age.With his musically inspired, often mysterious painting, he built a bridge between the older art of the Bellini workshop and that of the young Titian. From Leonardo's pictures, he had learned a vibrant coloration of the painterly form (sfumato) which he creatively developed, and in addition, he is supposed to have been cultured, with an interest in music and poetry.The Self-Portrait in Brunswick has been cropped, important parts which illuminate the mystery of the portrait character have been lost. However the original version can be reconstructed thanks to an etching by Wenzel Hollar dating from 1650, when Giorgione's picture was still entire. Originally, the sitter was holding the severed head of Goliath out in front of him on the balustrade that framed the picture at the bottom, adopted in other words the role of the biblical hero David.Giorgione's Self-Portrait as David is the first allegorical artist self-portrait in the history of European art

34908-01catal.jpg	The Romanesque church of San Isidoro had been built during the reign of Fernando I, the first king of Le�n and Castile, and his wife Do&#241;a Sancha, the daughter of King Alfonso V of Le�n. Its purpose was to house the relics of St Isidore of Seville which Fernando I arranged to be brought from there. Immediately after the consecration of the church in 1063, the king died. In the following years Do&#241;a Sancha had the so-called Pante�n de los Reyes built to the west of the church site.

30209-1cicogn1.jpg	Palma Giovane's masterpiece is the decoration of the oratory at the Ospedaletto dei Crociferi, especially the singular triptych (1586-87) with its on-the-spot report of the prelude to and beginning of the dogeship of Pasquale Cicogna. Astonishingly, the events related (1. Pasquale Cicogna Hearing Mass Celebrated in the Oratory of the Crociferi by Father Priamo Balbi, 2.

It was in the oratory that Pasquale Cicogna heard mass, it was in the oratory that he received the news of his election, and it was the oratory he finally visited resplendent in his dogal robes.

The Republic summons to rule her men who have distinguished themselves in their devotion and commitment to welfare.In this scene, apart from the carpet of honour, equal moral stature is given to the pious Venetian patrician and the modest residents of the charitable institution.

07496-20medusa.jpg	In Greek myth, Perseus used the severed snake-haired head of the Gorgon Medusa as a shield with which to turn his enemies to stone. By the sixteenth century Medusa was said to symbolize the triumph of reason over the senses; and this may have been why Cardinal Del Monte commissioned Caravaggio to paint Medusa as the figure on a ceremonial shield presented in 1601 to Ferdinand I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. The poet Marino claimed that it symbolized the Duke's courage in defeating his enemies.As a feat of perspective, the picture is remarkable, for out of the apparently concave surface of the shield - in fact convex- the Gorgon's head seems to project into space, so that the blood round her neck appears to fall on the floor. In terms of its psychology, however, it is less successful. The boy who modelled the face (in preference to a girl) is more embarrassed than terrifying. For once Caravaggio cannot achieve an effect of horror; he was to find in the legends of the martyrs a more powerful stimulus to the dark side of his imagination than classical myth

09511-hercules.jpg	In the present painting, the artist has depicted Hercules, the son of Zeus and the mortal woman Alcmene, gesturing towards the heavens while standing amidst the bodies of several of the great creatures that he has slain or captured as part of his twelve labours. These bodies are those of the Nemean Lion, the Erymanthian Boar, and the Lernaean Hydra.The painting is a study of the idealised male nude, epitomised by this demi-god. Hercules's powerful nude body, seen from behind, entirely dominates the canvas. The image of the male nude from behind is a recurring motif throughout Cornelis van Haarlem's paintings and drawings

05685-pompado2.jpg	Although Boucher served the rococo movement well, it was essentially through the exercise of concious fancy rather than any profoundly imaginative impulse. He was capable of painting straightforward genre scenes and portraits soberly realistic. All his portraits of Madame de Pompadour are characterized by equal directness and emphasis upon spontaneity. He placed her reading, reclining, seizing a hat before going for a walk, and not only in natural poses but in a natural, half-rural setting. Simply dressed and well equipped with books, she pauses in her reading to listen to a bird singing, in a wonderful woodland of velvet moss and silken foliage. This is a portrait artificial only in the way that Watteau and Gainsborough were artificial. It is utterly simple in concept, even anti-rococo, when compared with the high court portraiture of Nattier

26019-10bless.jpg	Memling painted a slightly different version of this composition in 1481. The type can be interpreted iconographically as the merging of the 'Vera Effigies' and 'Salvator Mundi'. It comprises a frontal portrayal of the face of Christ in a manner that had become standard in fifteenth-century art, having been established as early as the thirteenth century by a description contained in the so-called Letter of Lentulus. The best-known example of this theme was executed by Jan van Eyck. The figure is transformed by Memling into a Salvator Mundi giving his blessing, but without the attributes of his power. He does not hold a crossed orb in his hand or wear a coronet on his head, but is presented in the form of a portrait, as a human being standing in a window, his left hand resting on the frame. He is the counterpart of the Man of Sorrows, the suffering Christ, as depicted by Memling in Genoa. In fact, the dark blue-green background and dark brownish-purple robe render the latter a kind of agonised metamorphosis of the Pasadena Christ.The immediate typological precursor of this presentation is the Master of Fl�malle's Salvator Mundi (Philadelphia, John G. Johnson Collection) in which the fingers of the left hand are also just visible above the edge. Christ himself, the form of his robe and the position of the hand with which he gives his blessing are a development on the Jean de Braque triptych by Rogier van der Weyden. Although created at a much earlier date and less robust and more transparent in its execution, the Pasadena version is readily comparable with Memling's Christ with musical angels in Antwerp. The rounded, almost sculptural features, the softly flowing hair of the beard and moustache, the fingers with their round tips in almost the same position of blessing, are all very similar. The underdrawing of the Pasadena work reveals that the hand making the blessing was designed on the panel itself. Several of its contours do not match the painted form at all, and the latter was itself corrected several times, even after the dark brown colour of the robe had already been painted around the fingers. The ring and little finger were originally drawn closer together, and the forefinger and index finger were more bent. Christ's hand in Antwerp is more or less the finished result of the Pasadena version, though in a more elongated form

37074-8decora1.jpg	Borrowing a decoration programme that had already been used in 1494 by Pinturicchio in the Borgia Apartment in Rome, Signorelli decided to decorate the area below his frescoes with grotesque ornamental motifs, busts of philosophers and poets, as well as monochromes illustrating their work. It is possible that the busts of philosophers and poets are intended as symbols of reason and moral values, the only instruments that man can use to keep in check the powerful animal instincts of his nature and to attain the higher spheres of the spirit.But one thing is certain: this apparently minor section, which was painted to a large extent by Signorelli's assistants, contains fascinating inventions and reaches extraordinary heights of expression. The artist gives free rein to his imagination in these grotesques, and the result is comparable only to the scenes that Filippino Lippi was painting at about the same time in the Strozzi Chapel in the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence.The only one of philosophers and poets that can be identified with certainty is Dante Alighieri, and some of the loveliest and most famous of the monochromes are illustrations of episodes from the Divine Comedy, for the most part from Purgatory.

26644-09_1pr6.jpg	The melancholy, abstracted Jeremiah, more than any other figure, is a deeply moving moral self portrait. Sorrowful unto death, he rests from his spiritual vision, to reflect on the hardship and frustration of earthly existence. We share the artist's pity for this noble being, prematurely aged and steeped in the anguish of the universe who, alone among the Prophets, must carry the weight of earthly existence. His hand grasps his beard with a saturnine gesture that seems to be second nature to him. The genii of Jeremiah are the strangest of the whole series. The one to the left is feminine and, as it were, an image of the Prophet's afflicted soul, painfully conscious of the absence of pure goodness and beauty on the earthly plane, unless it be in art; and even that was all too often suspect to the zealous among Christian and Jewish communities where iconoclasm was forever lurking in the dark recesses of the mind. In short, the genius is a symbol of Platonism defeated in Michelangelo's youth by Savonarola. Platonism itself found expression in the most sublime among the ignudi on the Prophet's left. The shaping of the limbs the perfect torso and magnificent, calmly musing profile surpass, if that be possible, the Greek ideal of beauty. The monkish, hooded figure on the Prophet's right is an unmistakable allusion to Savonarola; to the summons of duty and conscience, to the injunction not to linger unduly in the realms of Greek art. That is why the ignudo above resembles a bent Atlas straining under the weight of his cornucopia, bearing a world that casts a shadow upon his shoulders.

35283-2queen.jpg	Maria Josepha, Archduchess of Austria, was born in 1699 in Vienna as the daughter of the subsequent Kaiser Joseph I. In 1719 she married the Saxon Prince Elector Frederick Augustus in Dresden, an occasion for which Frederick Augustus's father Augustus the Strong staged a series of court festivities of enormous splendour. The marriage was blessed with fifteen children, of whom several died at a tender age. Maria Josepha propagated Catholicism in Protestant Saxony, more specifically the form espoused by the Jesuits (almost all other children were given either Ignatius or Francis Xavier as their patron saint). She died in 1757 in Dresden, a year after the commencement of the Seven Years War.This portrait shows the Queen at the age of 56. She wears the cross and ribbon of the Russian Order of St Catherine, as well as the Austrian Order of the Starry Cross. Among her exquisite items of jewellery she wears a drop-shaped brilliant in her hair that is held in place by a clip shaped like a black eagle. This famous gem is still preserved in the Green Vault in Dresden to this day. The miniature portrait on her richly adorned bracelet shows her husband.

34165-samuel.jpg	"Reynolds never tired of encouraging his students at the Royal Academy to bear in mind how important it was to study the contents and techniques of the old masters and, by copying them, to develop a style they could use. Though Reynolds himself was a highly distinctive painter, he mastered ""a-la-mode"" painting and could effortlessly slip into the guise of another style.Here in his portrait of The Infant Samuel, the stylistic guise he dons is that of Rembrandt. In earthy shades of brown, he shows Samuel, the last judge and first prophet of Israel, as a child. The very choice of theme is unusual, considering the role of Samuel as the epitome of constant obedience, great wisdom and just but firm rule, a weighty role indeed for a child of such tender age, as Reynolds shows here. By using the light and colours of Rembrandt, he also cites the profound human piety of the Dutch artist's oeuvre. In this way, the Rembrandtesque becomes a motif of dignity that not only enriches the painting and lends it profound significance, but also mediates between the religious Old Testament theme and the innocence of the child"

41123-0altarpi.jpg	"The altarpiece from Westphalia in north-western Germany was painted for the Wiesenkirche in Soest during the closing years of the Hohenstaufen family's rule of the Holy Roman Empire (1138-1254). It depicts St Mary, the Trinity and St John. The break with Byzantine art also coincided with the end of this dynasty and the subsequent interregnum (1256-73). The altarpiece can be assigned to this transitional period.In this retable, jagged shapes are used as the main structural framework for the figures. The garments look as if they had been blow out and then frozen. The pointed folds project from the bodies in a rigid and unwieldy fashion. The shapes appear all the more bizarre as they are set in a framework of evenly rounded arches.The picture area is divided into three panels of equal size by arches and half-columns. The mounted arcades of the frame, the clear contours of the figures, the gold background and the brilliant colours are reminiscent of reliquaries and precious retables worked in brightly coloured enamels and gold. In their abstract exaggeration, the sharply pointed folds of the clothes are typical of the late phase of the pointed style and therefore of the conclusion of the Byzantine-influenced tendency within painting. The middle panel shows God the Father on his throne. In his hands he holds the cross with the body of his sacrificed son. Above, there hovers the dove of the Holy Spirit. The cross grows out of the earth, alluding to the double nature of Christ, who is both man and god. Standing in the side panels are the Virgin Mary and St John the baptist, who appear as intercessors for humankind. The representation of the Holy Trinity in the form of the 'mercy seat' illustrates the sacrifice of the Son of God, in which, constantly renewed, God's mercy is revealed.This example illustrates the exceptional form of Romanesque painting known as the German ""zigzag style,"" or sometimes ""jagged style."" It marks the transition to the Gothic style"

34399-louis14.jpg	At the end of Louis XIV's reign the outstanding painter was Hyacinthe Rigaud. Although his activity continued well into the next century, the ethical quality of his figures and the aesthetic quality of his style are part of the spirit of the Louis XIV period.Guided by Le Brun, Rigaud created in painting, as Coysevox had done in sculpture, the portrait of the 'man of quality', whose value he conveyed by the nobility of the attitude, expressiveness of the gesture, and movement of the draperies - in short, by the passion of which he showed his generous temperament to be capable. The aim was less to depict and individual and a character, as Philippe de Champaigne had done in the preceding period, than to affirm the social rank and 'condition' of the sitter, who might be the King, a minister, a financier, or a soldier, but who was always of the Court. Rigaud thus started the Court portrait, which was to have a considerable importance in Europe during the next century.

13783-samarita.jpg	When Fetti came into contact with Paolo Veronese's clear, luminous colours on his arrival in Venice, his delicate naturalism, which clearly owed a lot to Caravaggio, took a richer turn and he found an ideal vehicle for his airy unrestrained inventiveness in paintings of small dimensions such as the celebrated 'parables'. In the 'Parable of the Good Samaritan' in the collection of the Accademia Galleries the gospel story is used (even more so than in the previous versions in the collections of the Gem&#228;ldegalerie of Dresden, the Metropolitan Museum of New York and Boston Museum) as a pretext for a skilful, rapid setting of a natural everyday scene caught in the lyrically evoked moment of sunset

18239-0509grec.jpg	Painted for the side altar on the Epistle side (right) of the church, and still in place. Probably painted 1578-79, following the completion of the High Altarpiece. The presence of Saint Ildefonso, the patron Saint of Toledo, was stipulated in the documents. Diego de Castilla, the Dean of Toledo Cathedral, is probably represented in this figure, which certainly is a portrait. The figure assists in setting an ideal plane for the enacting of the mystic event. El Greco has eliminated the intrusion of an incongruous space. The ground running parallel with the plane of the action produces no conflict. The rhythm of the passages of colour and light over the surface helps to hold together the composition, with its dramatic split revealing the figure of the Risen Christ. What suggestions remain of an ordinary conception of space, of corporeality and of a schematic quality of composition, disappear in his final version of the subject (painted in 1596-1600, now in the Prado, Madrid)

13582-haystack.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Alongside history paintings, the early period of the Macchiaioli notably included the Castiglioncello School of landscape art, of significance in the 1860s in particular. (The school was named after the Tuscan coastal town where the artists gathered to work.) The painters of this school, among them Giuseppe Abbati, Odoardo Borrani, and Giovanni Fattori, constituted a homogenous subgroup within the Macchiaioli. At first Abbati's art was to the fore, subsequently that of Fattori.At Castiglioncello, Fattori painted not only a number of highly successful portraits but also enchanting landscape studies such as The Haystack. The simple compositional structure and his characteristically broad brushwork of the early period are particularly engaging in this painting

32312-10thehol.jpg	A motionless quality is found in the few classical paintings of Poussin's last years, such as the Holy Families. The most striking of these is one with almost life-size figures in the Hermitage, probably finished in 1655. The last vestiges of action and expression have gone. The only figure to make any gesture at all is the infant St John, who holds out his hands. The other figures are lost in a marble stillness, which gives a sort of abstract grandeur to the composition.The painting was commissioned by Pierre Fr�art de Chantelou, a court official of Louis XIII, for whose personal collection the artist executed a series of works

08835-francis.jpg	This is a work with high pietistic content, which interprets fully a sort of anti-Mannerist reaction of a religious-moralistic nature. Leaving aside the facile emotivity generated by the emphatic pose of the kneeling saint and the mystical, theatrical smoke which heralds the divine event, the painting is a work of extreme austerity, and avowedly prosaic even from a technical point of view, considering that the artist, breaking with the Tuscan design tradition, executed it in the Venetian style, almost entirely with colour.

42006-solomon.jpg	The influence of Caravaggio's dramatic style which revolutionised European painting at the beginning of the seventeenth century can be seen clearly in Valentin's work. He would have come into contact with Caravaggio's work in Rome where he went as a very young man, and spent all of his short career. In The Judgment of Solomon the strength of forms outlined against the shadow, so reminiscent of Caravaggio, does not preclude an atmosphere of mystery and poetry that is peculiar to Valentin. Louis XIV owned several of his paintings; five are still hanging in the King's bedchamber in the Ch�teau de Versailles

44291-venice.jpg	The present canvas is the artist's earliest dated Venetian veduta.The Molo is the small stretch of quay in front of the Piazzetta and the government buildings that line it, including the Zecca and the Library to the left, and to the right the Ducal Palace, with the state prison beyond the Ponte della Paglia de Prigioni. Behind the columns of St. Mark and Todaro, we see the Campanile, the basilica of San Marco itself and the Torre del'Orologio, which faces onto Piazza San Marco. A catalogue of the different kind of boats is virtually displayed on the Bacino: a galley is moored to the quay in front of the Ducal Palace, not far from two lateen rigged ships. In the right foreground is another ship, its stern to the left, sporting as its figure-head a lion. There is a good deal of traffic on the water. Behind the gondola transporting people to the right a peata can be seen, to the left another peata with livestock and behind it a bragozzo.Van Wittel repeated this view more than once, sometimes on canvases as much as two metres wide. The composition has been varied by so many artists &#151; including Canaletto and Guardi &#151; that it became one of the most familiar views of Venice. The concept of a frontal view of the entrance of the Piazzetta is not Van Wittel's invention, but dates back to the sixteenth century. However, all previous versions of the theme show a much smaller segment of the quay. Van Wittel's view emphasizes the longitude of the Molo, that seems to stretch both left and right beyond the frame. This reference to the profile-view of Venice gives Van Wittel's composition an extraordinary tension, that is missing in the smaller versions.

35442-73religi.jpg	This monumental canvas once decorated the high altar of the Jesuit church in Ghent. When the order was dissolved at the end of the 18th century, Louis XVI bought the painting which, after the French Revolution, ended up in the Brussels museum.According to the legend, the Scots monk Livinus was not only bishop of Ghent but also a martyr whose tongue was torn out. It is possible that Rubens was commissioned to produce this painting for the millennium of the martyrdom in 1633. In so doing a date previously assumed for Livinus' martyrdom was corrected and the exemplary behaviour of a local saint, the founder of the local community of believers, was given place of honour in the church. All this is typical of the Jesuit's counter-reformation intentions of basing the re-sourcing of the true faith on militant, recognisable and historically grounded foundations. Their founder, Ignatius of Loyola, defended the heroism of the martyrs against the Protestants.In the prints of Meditations on the Gospel, a book of devotions written by the Jesuit Hieronymus Nadal on Ignatius' instructions, the accent is therefore on the cruelty of their tortures. Rubens' depiction of Livinus' torture follows the same line. The viewer is spared not a single horrible detail, neither the blood-spattered knife in the torturer's mouth who in the left foreground grins at the saint in his bishops' garments with his mitre and staff, nor his companion who has grabbed Livinus' beard, nor his comrade-in-arms holding the saint's torn-out tongue in a pair of tongs above an avidly yapping dog. The strong gestures, the rhythm of the paint strokes, the shimmering lighting and the masterly colour composition carry the sense of movement to a climax. From heaven comes the reward for the martyr and the justified retribution for his executioners' misdeed, in the figures of two putti, who reach Livinus the martyr's palm, and the angels who, with their thunderbolts, cause the soldiery to disperse in fear and their horses to bolt. For this final, central detail, Rubens took his inspiration from the famous Tyrant Slayers group of statues in front of the Quirinale Palace in Rome, thereby playing to the learned Jesuits' love for surprising aesthetic effects and their erudite knowledge of antiquity

Alexander, standing nearby, appears to be offering advice, clearly not requested, to the famous painter. So beautiful is Campaspe (even the little white dog notices and touches her lightly with its paw) that the artist, while painting her portrait, will fall hopelessly in love with her, and the Macedonian king, exhibiting his great generosity, will give the woman to Apelles on the spot

06323-09saulco.jpg	Bruegel shows Paul's army on its way to Damascus in contemporary dress and with sixteenth-century armour and weapons. The saint himself is in a blue doublet and hose of the painter's day. Bruegel, having lived in Italy, was not unfamiliar with classical dress: his intention in representing biblical scenes in contemporary dress was to stress their relevance to his own time. In view of the persecution and counter-persecution of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, the story of Paul's conversion had especial significance.This painting shows a biblical motif with political overtones. The painter has set Saul's conversion to Paul in a mountain landscape. The sea may be seen in the distance. It was from there, from the Italian coast, that the Spanish troops set off to cross the Alps, their task to drive out the heretics and crush Netherlands efforts to obtain more freedom

30556-ceiling.jpg	"During his fifty-year reign (1680-1730) Vittorio Amadeo II transformed Turin, the second royal residence on Italian soil after Naples, into one of the most splendid Baroque cities in Europe. In 1584 he started the enlargement of the palace known as the Palazzo Reale. The additions to the palace were patterned after the models of French court architecture, but for the wall decorations he looked for Italian painters. The decoration continued under the reign of Carlo Emanuele III (1730-1773).After the long reign of Carlo Emanuele III, his forty-eight-year-old son Vittorio AmadeoIII assumed the throne in 1773 In 1777 the new king, signaling a change in taste from Baroque to classicism, had the royal chambers on the piano nobile enriched by a ceiling painted by Laurent P�cheux, who, born in Lyon and influenced in Rome by Anton Raphael Mengs and Pompeo Batoni, was named ""primo pittore di corte.""  P�cheux required six years to paint the ceiling of the royal library. Here the break with the Baroque tradition and the return to the ideals of Bolognese classicism is manifested in the severe formal idiom, the fussy drawing, and the saturated colours.The subject of the painting on the ceiling of the library is Truth Pursued by Time, is Placed under the Protection of Jupiter by Minerva. The ceiling arrangement is dominated by stucco caryatides and monochrome panels with friezelike, small-figured compositions all'antica. P�cheux provided a written explanation to the pictorial program, which he prefaced with the comment that painting in a royal palace must be instructive as well as decorative"

34320-1zane2.jpg	The Palazzetto Zane was designed by Antonio Gaspari not as a place in which to live, but merely as a place in which to enjoy oneself. Marino Zane, the seventeenth-century owner of the building, wanted the vault of the double-height portego - the principal room around which the various spaces of the villa were organized - decorated in stucco work. He commissioned Abbondio Stazio, and a less-well-known artist, Andrea Pelli, to execute the work. The frescoes, formerly attributed to Nicol&#242; Bambini, were in fact painted by Sebastiano Ricci.The central compartment of the ceiling depicts Hercules between Glory and Virtue, in the four corners are monochromes of Olympian gods. The pairs of monochrome medallions depict Mercury and Diana, Amphitrite and Neptune, Juno and Pan, Hercules and Jupiter, and symbols of the four elements - Earth, Water, Air and Fire. The monochromes are inserted in stucco frames supported by graceful putti and intertwined with wreaths of leaves, some oak, some laurel

19108-16nolaug.jpg	This is one of the most famous portraits in the world, yet the identity of the man is unknown. From the inscription in the upper right corner we know only that he was twenty-six years old when Hals painted him in 1624, presumably as a commission from the sitter himself. The title, inaccurate but now inseparable from the work, dates from the 1870s when it was first exhibited by Sir Richard Wallace. Its modern fame is founded partly on the incomparable skill with which Hals has painted the brilliant costume (including the love emblems on the doublet), but above all on the vivid portrayal of swaggering self-confidence

16418-baptis3.jpg	The banquet takes place in a splendid open hall, decorated with small marble figures. John the Baptist is beheaded at the request of the dancing Salome. In contrast to the festiveness of the scene, Giotto increases the brutality of the events through the gestures, culminating in the encounter between Herod and the henchman, who hands him the severed head as if it were a dish of fare. Even although the surface of the faces is badly damaged, this moment of horror and outrage is still clear: plates, hands, dishes and head form an alarmingly brutal unity, over which soldier and king look at one another

17082-orchar03.jpg	"Catalogue numbers: F 394, JH 1379.The painter Anton Mauve married into van Gogh's family in 1874 and became a cousin of Vincent. When van Gogh went to The Hague in November 1881, Mauve, who normally accepted no students, was willing to teach him the use of oil paint and watercolour. Unfortunately, the fruitful relation between the painters did not last long. When van Gogh started a personal liaison with Sien Hoornik, an unmarried mother and prostitute, Mauve, like others, was scandalised and broke off all contact with Vincent. Nevertheless, van Gogh always fondly remembered his lessons with the painter. When Mauve died in 1888, van Gogh, who by then was painting flowering trees in Arles, inscribed one of his compositions with ""Souvenir de Mauve"" and sent it to the artist's widow"

42650-35seat.jpg	Signature: Signed on the wall to the right of the head.Provenance: Like the Lady Standing at a Virginal, this painting may or may not have been part of the Duarte collection in Antwerp in 1682; the Amsterdam sale of 1696, no. 37; and the Amsterdam sale of 1714. It was part of the collection of Count Sch�nborn, Pommersfelden, and sold in Paris in 1867. Acquired for Fr 2,000 by W. B�rger, and sold in the sale of his collection in Paris in 1892. Art Gallery Sedelmeyer, 1898. Art gallery T. Humphry Ward, London, 1894 (?). Collection George Salting, 1900. Bequeathed by him to the museum in 1910.Whereas the Lady Standing at the Virginal (National Gallery, London) is bathed in light, this putative companion piece features a subdued atmosphere. The shade is drawn here, and though we can make out every detail in the limpid light, Baburen's Procuress hanging on the back wall furnishes the main contrast. It is curious to observe that while inanimate objects - the clavecin, the bass viol in the foreground to the left, and the decorations of the musical instrument - are extremely detailed, the curtain to the left is stiff, and the lady making music is devoid of expression, depersonalized, and faultily drawn (see, e.g., her arms).There can be no question that the paintings from these last years are vastly inferior to what we have been accustomed to by Vermeer

24557-annuncia.jpg	Fifteenth-century viewers of this Annunciation would have recognized not only its general subject, but also the particular moment Masolino chose to paint. Street preachers gave vivid accounts of Gabriel's message to Mary about Christ's birth, and audiences would also have  seen the Annunciation reenacted on its feast day. In Florence, Brunelleschi designed an apparatus to lower an actor portraying Gabriel from the cathedral dome, as  young children dressed as angels hung suspended in rigging. Events in the drama took place in sequence. Mary was first startled at the angel's sudden appearance; she reflected on his message and queried Gabriel about her fitness; finally, kneeling, she submitted to God's will. Here Mary's downcast eyes and musing gesture -- hand resting tentatively on her breast -- suggest the second, and most often depicted, of these stages: reflection. As did actors in the religious plays, artists used gesture and posture to communicate states of mind.Masolino is best known for his collaboration with Masaccio on the frescoes of the Brancacci chapel in Florence -- and for his failure to pursue Masaccio's innovations. Masolino continued to paint in a style that was delicate and ornamental. His colors are flowerlike, his figures elegant but unreal. They do not seem so much to exist within the painted space as to be placed before it. In the ceiling, colorful tiles, a device used by Masaccio to create perspective lines, are merely decorative and leave space ambiguous

The earth and water have brought forth their swarms of living creatures, including a giraffe, an elephant, and some wholly fabulous animals, like the unicorn. In the centre rises the Fountain of Life, a tall, slender roseate structure resembling a delicately carved Gothic tabernacle. The precious gems glittering in the mud at its base and some of the more fanciful animals probably reflect the medieval descriptions of India, whose marvels had fascinated the West since the days of Alexander the Great and where popular belief situated the lost Paradise of Eden.In the foreground of this antediluvian landscape, we see the union of Adam and Eve by Christ.

29634-kitchen.jpg	It is difficult to say with any certainty which scene is depicted in the background of this painting. It may well be the story of an epileptic 'with an evil spirit,' recorded several times in the Bible.

12370-4battle.jpg	The theme of the painting is taken from Ovid. The Lapiths, a peace-loving people of Thessaly, were celebrating the wedding of their king Pirithous to Hippodamia. The Centaurs were invited but they quickly began to misbehave. One of them, Eurytus, full of liquor, tried to carry off the bride and soon a battle raged in which drinking vessels, table legs, antlers, in fact anything to hand, served as weapons. Blood and brains were scattered everywhere. Finally, thanks chiefly for Theseus, the friend of Pirithous, who was among the guests, the Centaurs were driven off. To the ancients and to the Renaissance the theme symbolized the victory of civilization over barbarism. It was used to decorate Greek temples, notably the metopes of the Parthenon (the 'Elgin marbles'), and was popular with baroque painters.Although the themes are not related, this painting seems to be in many respects a variant of the Conversion of Paul executed five years earlier. The two even look like pendants, although they were not made as such. They are roughly the same size, and the figure are on the same scale and in a similar type of landscape. The foreground of both pictures is dominated by a galloping horse mounted by a figure turning to look back with a large drapery fluttering overhead. And in both these tumultuous scenes a horse tramples a man on the ground. Dujardin employed the same means in both pictures, but he envisaged and achieved different results. The later painting is more reminiscent of a classical relief, its colour contrasts and chiaroscuro are less pronounced and dramatic, it is more subdued and 'classicist'.

23773-family.jpg	Formerly this painting was attributed to the Amsterdam painter Esias Boursse. It is not surprising since Cornelis de Man and Esias Boursse were both clearly much influenced by the work of their Delft contemporaries Pieter de Hooch and Johannes Vermeer. The feature of the prominent fireplace on the right side of the composition appears to have been a favourite of de Man's, and a very similar compositional arrangement recurs in his most famous work, the Chess players of around 1670

17936-haar_sea.jpg	Jan van Goyen was born in Leiden and trained in the studios of a succession of local artists. His most influential teacher, however, was Esaias van de Velde in whose Haarlem studio he spent a year before establishing . himself as an independent painter in his native town. Subsequently van Goyen worked in The Hague and Haarlem.In his earliest landscapes - his first dated painting is from 1618 - van Goyen employed the highly coloured, strongly linear technique of Esaias van de Velde, but progressively his paintings become less colourful and less crowded with figures. He shared this move towards a deliberately restricted palette of blues, greys, greens and blacks, and simple compositions, with the Haarlem landscape painters, Pieter Molijn and Salomon van Ruysdael. In the work of all three painters the sky assumes greater and greater importance, as in this painting in which it occupies almost three-quarters of the picture surface. The clouds are painted thinly over the prepared ground of the panel which gives a warm undertone. In this view of Haarlemmer Meer, a vast inland lake which was not drained until the nineteenth century, the Great Church at Haarlem can be seen on the horizon in the far right-hand corner. This atmospheric study of clouds and still water was painted in the last year of the artist's life.With his linear style it is no surprise to discover that van Goyen was an indefatigable draughtsman. More than 800 drawings and several sketchbooks, all in his favourite medium of black chalk and wash, are known today. Many are quick sketches made from nature during his travels in the north Netherlands and Germany, which in the studio were transformed into imaginative landscapes. His rapid painting technique enabled him to be a prolific artist: more than twelve hundred paintings from his hand survive

35856-tavern.jpg	The differences between Salomon van Ruysdael and Jan van Goyen are not very pronounced during the 1630s, and they can come so close to each other that some confusion has occurred in the attribution of their paintings. This similarity disappears about the middle of the 1640s, when a new force and beauty mark's Salomon's turn to the later phase of his art, as demonstrated in this picture.The heroic tree motif, which Salomon's nephew Jacob raised to an outstanding feature in his art, now appears prominently in his paintings, strengthening the compositions by vertical accents. They form a glowing dark contrast against a colourful sunset sky. His trees never gain much body, and remain thin and feathery in his early minute manner, but they function beautifully in the total pictorial effect, which can gain an extraordinary splendour by the colours of the sky with mother-of-pearl streaks of pink and blue, violet and grey. The air is shiny, and more activities go on than before both on the land and on the water. Max J. Friedlander must have had works of this period in mind when he said:'While the weather in van Goyen's pictures always make you feel it will soon rain, Ruysdael's pictures make you feel it has rained, and a fresh wind has driven the rain away.

30350-crucifix.jpg	"The poet Petrarch called Venice ""a world apart."" Protected by a bewildering network of canals, the city naturally turned to the sea and, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, commanded an extensive empire in the eastern Mediterranean. When Venetian commercial interests diverted the Fourth Crusade from the Holy Land to loot the riches of Byzantium instead, many Greek artists were forced to find work in Italy.That the city remained tied to its Byzantine traditions is evident in the work of Paolo Veneziano, the first Venetian artist we know by name. If he was aware of the more naturalistic styles of his contemporaries in other parts of Italy, he chose not to emulate them. This painting's small size and arched shape suggest that it might have originally crowned a larger panel in a multipart altarpiece. Paolo's style is essentially Byzantine, with ethereal figures and flat gold backgrounds. But his form -- the altarpiece -- is a Western one.Paolo's Coronation of the Virgin also is part of the Gallery's collection. The subject of the Coronation was not painted by Byzantine artists and seems to have originated near Paris in the twelfth century. This may be the first such scene painted in Venice. Its strong colors and brittle figures seem almost abstract, a sense increased by the gold striations of the drapery: even without Byzantine models to follow, Paolo's painting has a strong Byzantine character."

20736-meleager.jpg	After the death of Rubens in 1640, Jacob Jordaens became the leading artist of the Southern Netherlands. He was primarily active in Antwerp, and his artistic aspirations did not extend quite so high as those of Rubens. Jordaens showed himself to be an uncomplicated member of the middle-class, and there is little room in his work for reflection or any feeling of transcendence. Although he never visited Italy, he was strongly influenced by Caravaggio. Traces of this influence are visible in the contrast between light and dark which serves to heighten the dramatic tension of his Meleager and Atalanta painted in 1618. The painting's subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses.

That this technique might be used to depict moment-by-moment developments within a particular episode is vividly illustrated by Scene 6, which also happens to incorporate a real window in the picture composition.In this scene the viewer is far more captivated by the massive rump of a horse looming up in the foreground or the two men scuffling on the right than by the actual subject matter, which is presented only in a tiny secondary scene in the background

35551-02lerma.jpg	When he visited the Spanish Court for the first time, Rubens used this picture to display his talents and to make his mark. It has already many elements of his mature Baroque style, which would have been novel and striking to his viewers. The way in which the horse seems to surge forward towards the spectator - an effect engineered by the low viewpoint and lack of balancing elements in the foreground, and recalling the techniques of Caravaggio - was spectacular, and broke with the traditional profile of equestrian portraits. Other devices used to enhance the spectacle were the eccentric colouring, the tempestuous lighting, and the rather disquieting energy of the horse's hair and the trees' foliage

24813-werl_r.jpg	The Werl Altarpiece was a triptych the central panel of which has been lost. The left wing depicts the donator  Heinrich von Werl, a theologian from Cologne, head of the Minorite Order, with St John the Baptist, the right wing St Barbara.Though long regarded as an authentic work by Robert Campin (the Master of Fl�malle), the altarpiece now is usually thought to be a pastiche by a follower. The bench on which St Barbara sits and the perspective of the whole room is taken over from Campin's Annunciation (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York); even the white towel and the ewer of water, symbolizing the Virgin's chastity, have been copied, though they are not the attributes of St Barbara. Her attribute, the tower in which she was imprisoned, is shown outside the window - typical of the way the early Netherlandish school rationalized abstract symbols naturalistically. In the left wing, the mirror on the wall is borrowed from Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Marriage in the National Gallery in London, painted four years earlier

19896-1ambassa.jpg	This huge panel is one of the earliest portraits combining two full-length figures on the scale of life. A paean to two scholar-diplomats and to the artist's virtuosity, it is on closer examination a reminder also of the brevity of life and of the vanity of human accomplishments. While life is short, Holbein seems to say, art is long-lasting - but eternity endures for ever.On our left stands Jean de Dinteville, a French nobleman posted to London as ambassador. The globe on the bottom shelf shows Polisy, where he had his ch&#226;teau; the ornate sheath of the dagger in his right hand gives his age as 29. To his left stands his friend and fellow-countryman, Georges de Selve, whose visit to London in 1533 is commemorated here. A brilliant classical scholar, he had some years earlier been created Bishop of Lavaur. He leans his elbow on a book inscribed with his age: 25. In their attire, their poses and their bearing the two friends exemplify, respectively, the active and the contemplative life, which, together, complement each other.On the what-not between them Holbein has depicted the wide range of their interests - a compendium of the culture of the age. On the top shelf, the minutely rendered `Turkey' carpet bears a celestial globe and an array of astronomical and navigational instruments. The cylindrical dial gives the date as 11 April; the polyhedral dial on the right indicates two different times of day. In front of the terrestrial globe on the lower shelf lies a German text-book of Arithmetic for Merchants, propped open with a T-square. A lute and a case of recorders or flutes demonstrate both Holbein's mastery of foreshortening and the sitters' musical interests. But a string of the lute has snapped, a traditional emblem of fragility. Just visible in the top left corner, at the edge of the magnificently patterned green hanging, is a crucifix. The hymnal in front of the lute is open at Martin Luther's hymn,'Come Holy Ghost our souls inspire'. Christian faith offers hope of eternal life when dust returns to dust.Across the mosaic floor - derived from the medieval pavement in Westminster Abbey - there spreads a curious shape between the two friends. It is a skull, skilfully distorted so that its true form can only be perceived from the correct viewpoint at the edges of the panel. The painting may have been intended to hang over a staircase so that viewers might see it when ascending or descending. Possibly referring to a personal device of Jean de Dinteville, whose cap medallion bears a skull, it is also the quintessential memento mori, reminder of mortality. In Holbein's meticulously real-seeming picture, the distortion also functions as a signal that reality, as perceived by the senses, must be viewed `correctly' to reveal its full meaning. A frontal nod of recognition at the worldly semblance of things is not enough

He is restrained by the Virgin's left hand and from her right hand he is about to receive an apple, while with his own right hand he playfully reaches for his toe.In terms of its composition and typology, the painting exhibits the well-known Memling characteristics, but technically it is heavily executed with rough modelling of the hands, the features and the drapery. It has clearly been painted by an average follower of Memling. Similar robust features and a face with rather oriental eyes are to be seen in a number of other Memlingian Virgins at half length.

Magdalena Ventura was from the Abruzzi, a region in the kingdom of Naples, and began to grow a beard when she was thirty-seven. Fifteen years later, the woman and her husband, a timid sort wearing an understandably befuddled expression, produced the infant she holds in her arms. As the inscription further attests, the picture was completed on 16 February 1631 by ""JOSEPHVS DE RIBERA HISPANUS CHRISTI CRVCE INSIGNITVS,"" a characteristic reference to Ribera's prized nationality and to the Order of Christ received from POpe Urban VIII on 29 January 1626.

Unfortunately a far from excellent state of preservation (partly due to its transfer from wood to canvas in 1949)  has compromised the quality of its colour composition, especially in the group of the Madonna and Child.The image is a kind of synthesis of Bellinian dictates, a height of unattainable unity of poetry and and metaphorical and religious meanings, which Bellini's complex culture on the one hand and his emotional depth on the other succed in reaching. Few works in fact have such a highly developed double nature, demanding therefore a comprehension and an interpretation that take account of different levels. Unequivocal is the poignant lyricism of the landscape, and its rarefied and intensely limpid presence. But the sky pervaded by an indefinitely serene light and, against its deep blue transparency, the golden weightless trees, the neat graceful buildings, the air devoid of sounds or disturbances, are also the ideal representation of the ""quies"" (spiritual reconciliation, idyllic or ascetic retreat into solitude) as the guiding principle of the Marian concept. Nor must we forget that if the Madonna sits down in a barren rocky land it is because she is a Madonna of Humility; if the lush and minutely depicted greenness of a meadow extends around her it is an allusion to the ""hortus conclusus"" of medieval hymns, while in the background other attributes referring to her are added: the fortress on the hill, the doorway, the well, the clouds (symbol of the humanity of Christ and also of divine mysteries), the struggle between the pelican and the snake"

29245-100muril.jpg	The subject of this painting, taken from the Old Testament was very popular in seventeenth-century painting. Sold into slavery in Egypt, Joseph served in the house of Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh's guard. Potiphar's wife made eyes at him, but he resisted her attempts at seduction. On one occasion, when she tried to entice him to bed, Joseph escaped and she was left with only his coat. Disappointed by yet another rejection, she told her husband that Joseph had made advances to her, whereupon the angry Potiphar had Joseph thrown into prison.Murillo's depiction is reminiscent of a scene in the theatre, showing the dramatic climax of the story; both figures are as if floodlit before the dark background. With arms outstretched, Joseph flees from the half-naked woman on the bed, who only succeeds in getting hold of his yellow cloak. In its division between of light and shade, this large picture betrays a preoccupation, typical of Murillo's early work, with the painting of Caravaggio and his circle, much of which was to be seen in Seville until the mid-seventeenth century.

25103-5queen.jpg	"The Master of the Legend of Saint Lucy is named after an altarpiece, dated 1480 and in a church in Bruges, that depicts episodes from the life of Saint Lucy. The Flemish city of Bruges often appears as the setting for the master's paintings. His style is characterized by extraordinarily brilliant colors, intricately detailed textures and patterns, compressed space, and figures with oval faces that are restrained in expression. Several of his paintings have been found in Castile, suggesting that the Netherlandish artist may have spent part of his career in Spain.This unusually large painting depicts a mystic glorification of the Virgin. Hovering angels, garbed in silks and brocades of every conceivable hue, attend a central image of Mary and surround a smaller, upper vision of her heavenly throne. On either side of the Virgin's head, singing angels hold musical scores that can be read as the Ave Regina Celorum, a hymn beginning with the words ""Hail, Queen of the Heavens."" This splendid picture comes from the convent of Santa Clara near Burgos in north central Spain. Records suggest that the work was commissioned by an aristocratic constable of Castile whose daughter was abbess of the convent.With a fusion of subjects, Mary, Queen of Heaven combines three sacred events from the legend of the Virgin. The Immaculate Conception, representing Mary's freedom from Original Sin, traditionally shows ""a woman arrayed with the sun, and a moon under her feet"" (Revelation 12:1). In the picture, sunbeams rendered in gold leaf blaze behind Mary's head and feet, and a crescent moon supports her.Three days after Mary's death, seraphim bore her to heaven. In this Assumption of the Virgin theme, an open sarcophagus is usually displayed but is absent here. In place of the coffin is a serene and peaceful landscape that may refer to a commonly held idea that, at the Assumption, the world was cleansed by the Virgin's purity.The third subject is the Coronation of the Virgin. Above her head, the clouds roll back to reveal heaven, with God the Father and Christ the Son holding a crown, above which hovers the dove of the Holy Spirit. Mary's coronation is only implied here, since she has not yet risen to join the Trinity. With its overlapping symbolism, spectacular flurry of ecclesiastical robes, and flutter of iridescent wings, Mary, Queen of Heaven is the Master of the Saint Lucy Legend's most sumptuous and ambitious achievement.Renaissance MusicIn addition to its radiant beauty and complicated theology, Mary, Queen of Heaven is an exceptionally important document for the history of music. The painting portrays Renaissance instruments with great accuracy, as they would have been played during fifteenth-century performances. In actual church services, however, this many orchestras and choirs would seldom have been used simultaneously. Eight instrumentalists surround the Virgin, for instance, while only four singers immediately flank her head. Since many of these instruments, such as the trumpet and woodwinds, would have been considered ""loud,"" they would have overwhelmed the chorus.On the left side, starting in the top corner, an angel in white blows a tenor or alto shawm, a precursor of the English horn. Beside him, an angel in wine red robes strums a Gothic harp. A brass trumpet is held by the figure in lilac blue, partially hidden behind the angel caressing Mary's shoulder. Dressed in pure yellow, another celestial musician pumps the bellows of a portative organ.In the top corner of the right side, an angel bows a vielle, an early form of violin. Next to him is a figure playing a soprano or treble shawm, a distant forerunner of the oboe. Halfway down the right side, an angel in cherry red plucks a lute, while, behind him, another shawm or woodwind is partly concealed behind olive green wings.The vocal quartet serenading Mary holds music with legible scores. The sheet to the left, which gives the painting its title, appears to be a variation on a motet, Hail, Queen of the Heavens, by Walter Frye (died 1474/1475), an English composer whose works were popular on the Continent. The sheet music to the right bears the word Tenor, which would be the voice that carries the melody.Among the clouds in the topmost portion, the musicians do correspond to actual usage. The orchestra at the right comprises ""soft"" instruments: three recorders, a lute, a dulcimer being struck by light hammers, and a harp. Two choruses are on the left of the Trinity. Both groups have one book of music each, suggesting that their singing is antiphonal and polyphonic. The upper choir, composed of winged angels in white robes, may represent a children's chorus. Overall, this encyclopedic combination of vocalists and ""loud"" and ""soft"" instrumentalists is unique in fifteenth-century painting"

This port and trading city was governed by a city oligarchy, consisting of members of aristocratic families such as the Pallavicinis, Durazzos, Grimaldis, Imperiales and Spinolas, who controlled the banking, economy and politics of the republic. These members of Genoese urban aristocracy were painted by Rubens around 1606-07. The portraits have none of the courtly formality that was so characteristic of the Low Countries tradition of portraiture in the manner of Mor and Frans Pourbus II.In portraits such as that of Maria Serra Pallavicino, the observer is struck by the high degree of realism. Rubens achieved this by a variety of means. He used interrupted backgrounds, where strategically placed porticos and pillars carry the eye of the observer into the distance; the brilliant suggestion of tangibility in the depiction of the costly satins  worn by the ladies, the impression they give of arrested movement, and the presence of children dwarves and pets that enliven the decorum of the subject. It is evident that the similar portraiture of Titian, and even more, of Veronese, were the models here. The treatment of colour and light, particularly in the glowing dark red of the ceremonial curtain and the reflections illuminating the dark, mainly brownish, architecture like flashes of lightning, is influenced by Tintoretto's technique

42987-3love2.jpg	This canvas is one of a series of four evidently representing various attributes of love, or perhaps different stages of love culminating in happy union. They were clearly designed as compartments of a decorated ceiling and might conceivably relate to a nuptial bedchamber. Veronese used this type of 'oblique perspective' for ceiling decorations in Venice: the angle of foreshortening corresponds to a viewpoint obliquely beneath the painting, avoiding the extreme distortion of figures imagined as directly above the viewer's head. By 1637 the four allegories, now all in the National Gallery, were recorded in the collection at Prague of the Emperor Rudolph II, the great art patron of his age, who probably commissioned them.The appearance of all four paintings has been badly affected by the irreversible discoloration of the smalt - a comparatively cheap blue pigment made from pulverised glass coloured with cobalt oxide - used to paint the sky, which now gives it a pale grey tinge instead of its original warm blue. With age, some of the green copper resinates of the foliage have oxidised to brown. In most respects this is the best preserved of the four pictures, and the one where Veronese's own hand, as opposed to his workshop assistants', is most visible.As befits an allegory, the meaning of the picture must be teased out. A nearly naked man is lying writhing on a ruinous ledge - perhaps an altar - in front of a statue in a niche holding a set of Pan pipes against its hairy thigh. The marble torso to the left of the statue has the goatish features of a satyr. This is a crumbling temple to the pagan divinities of unbridled sexuality. Cupid uses his bow mercilessly to beat the man, watched by two women: a shimmering bare-breasted beauty in a silver-striped dress with rose and yellow kirtle, accompanied by a duenna. Enfolded within her green mantle the chaperon holds a small white beast - an ermine, symbol of chastity, thought to prefer death to impurity. The general significance, then, is clear. The man has been felled by lust for a sensuous yet chaste woman, and is being punished. But the trite verbal translation does not begin to do justice to Veronese's robustly and wittily imagined scene: the ferocious plump Cupid astride his hapless victim, the scornful femme fatale drawing aside her skirts

12108-bathsheb.jpg	Willem Drost was a pupil of Rembrandt. His presence in Rembrandt's studio is undocumented, however, his works suggest that he had contact with the master in the late 1640s or early 1650s. Support for connecting him with Rembrandt is given by his sensuous, half-length Bathsheba dated 1654 which was unmistakable inspired by Rembrandt's superb painting done in the same year of the same subject, also in the Louvre, Paris. Drost's beautiful half-nude Bathsheba captures none of the overtones of Uriah's wife's story sensed in Rembrandt's moving portrayal of her contemplating her decision to go to David, but it impresses by the smooth painting of the palpable  glowing flesh set off by heavy impasto of the drapery and its strong chiaroscuro effect

03582-birds.jpg	The Bird Corporation, which celebrated its 200th anniversary in 1995, produced high-quality paper. In 1812, the company was chosen to produce the paper that the new nation's currency was printed on. When Charles graduated from Harvard he joined the company. Eccentric is the word used to describe him; he often spent his evenings at home, performing experiments in his kitchen. In 1880, a devastating fire, followed by the worst flood in Massachusetts' history, left only the equipment that could produce coarse paper unharmed. Charles used his kitchen laboratory to invent new products, of which were roofing papers, and the company became even stronger.Edith was an eminent member of Boston society. She was also active in hunt circles, which may be why Beaux chose to portray Charles and Edith in their hunting attire. Edith married Robert P. Bass, then the governor of New Hampshire, in 1912.This portrait of Charles and Edith displays the close relationship they must have shared. They are turned slightly toward each other, and the viewer seems to have interrupted their private conversation. Edith is dressed mostly in white, a colour that Beaux was famously skilled at employing. Her black skirt and boots, a dramatic contrast, anchor her to the floor and mirror her brother's black riding boots. Charles, pulling his glove from his pocket, seems to have a bit of contempt for the viewer or perhaps is merely impatient at having to wait and be painted while there is more interesting and important work to be done

21971-4leda.jpg	In the inventories, the famous painting of Leda and the Swan was for three hundred years (until 1893) thought to be by Sodoma, or a copy by the latter. Its attribution is still doubtful, but from recent research into wills it is now thought to be an unfinished painting that was in Leonardo's house at the time of his death (1519) and inherited by his pupil Salai who reworked it. X-rays have revealed another composition beneath this one depicting Leda's four children (Castor, Pollux, Helen and Clytemnestra) emerging from the swan's eggs. Leda with her arms around the swan (Jupiter) in an elegant curving pose, her hair partially escaping from her plaits, set against the spacious river landscape, was most certainly conceived by Leonardo, but executed by different artists

39100-081visio.jpg	The Vision of St Anne was painted in 1759 for the church of Santa Chiara at the Benedictine monastery in Cividale, Friuli. The building can be made out in the small image in the background, together with the Santuario di Castelmonte and the old bridge over the River Natisone. The painting was removed from the church in 1810 and finally came to the Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Dresden in 1914 through auction.In this strongly vertical composition, Tiepolo develops three distinct levels, one above the other: kneeling at the front is St Anne, who holds out her arms while gazing up to heaven; her husband, Joachim, who is shown behind a balustrade with his hands folded in prayer, looks in the same direction. Borne aloft on a cloud by angels, the young Mary is suspended above them. She too looks up to heaven and God the Father, who appears there leaning on the globe with his arms outstretched.Tiepolo shows us here the full glory of his light palette, most especially in the area centring on the Virgin, which is charged with light. His rational working methods &#151; no doubt first tested in frescoes &#151; speak from his technique of applying areas of colour approximately and then heightening them with his draughtsman's eye using black lines. Tiepolo's virtuoso methods make this visionary work utterly convincing

43792-17gilles.jpg	The late pictures shows Watteau moving beyond the enchanted mythology of Cythera - not into deeper dreams but closer to disenchanted reality. After a few quite small pictures it was on a large scale that he summed up the sense of isolation and odd man out, in the Gilles. Though this is no self-portrait, the sense of self identification is very strong and adds to the poignant effect. The group of laughing actors in the background, with a clown tugged along Silenus-like on a donkey, is probably inspired by an engraving of Gillot's; but what had been his main subject is deliberately reduced by Watteau to a frieze of busts that do not interfere with the tall white figure of Gilles, perfectly still, posed frontally against the empty sky. Once again, a figure seems to assume clothes for a part. Just as in the F&#234;te v�nitienne Watteau's own sensitive features and beautifully articulated hands contrasted with his humble costume, so Gilles seems too dignified for the clown's white floppy tunic and abbreviated trousers. The moon-shaped hat encircles a vividly painted but solemn face, its lack of animation the more marked when compared with the boisterous lively faces behind. There is a complete separation between the group and the individual; they are active while he is idle, having fun while he remains unsmiling, welded into a self contained group while he gazes out directly at the spectator. It is difficult not to feel that Watteau intends his to be the real awareness. He stands there a little dumbly, himself with a smack of the berger but dependent, like all entertainers, on his audience. The picture's mood is complex and inexplicably moving; it seems to record not a prologue but an epilogue (as so often in Watteau), a silencing of laughter and the sort of hush that pricks the eyes with unshed tears.

00826-1trinita.jpg	This work was originally commissioned by Palla Strozzi from Lorenzo Monaco, for the sacristy of the church of Santa Trinit&#224; in Florence, but by the time of Monaco's death only the pinnacles of this work had been painted. When Angelico took over the commission he found himself cribbed and confined by Monaco's ready-made triple-arched Gothic frame. He ignored these constraints, however, making skilful use of the three arches in his composition to provide a scene of stunning beauty and subdued yet poignant emotion, set in an expansive Tuscan landscape. Although the work is painted on one panel, the three arches of the frame find an echo in the placing of the figures in three groups.The central arch is largely blocked off by the wooden framework of the cross and two ladders. The cross bar of the former appears to run behind the picture frame hinting at further, obscured space. With no scene behind but the sky and the lattice work of timber, the eye is drawn to the body of Christ which is at the very centre of the picture. Angelico challenges the tendency of the other two arches to define the shape and space of the work by placing a strong vertical, in the form of a tower or a tree, in the corners of each. The pilasters on either side of the frame contain twelve panels with full length portraits of saints, and eight medallions with portrait busts. The full-length figures are shown standing on columns which are each painted with careful attention to the view-point of the spectator

15452-1announ.jpg	Fina, the pious daughter of poor parents, died on the feast day of Saint Gregory in 1253 after a long and painful illness. She was just fifteen years old. According to legend, after the death of her mother Fina lived an ascetic lifestyle so strict she was, in the end, scarcely able to move. Vermin and rats gnawed at her body until death finally liberated her from her prolonged sufferings. Pope Gregory the Great, in full regalia, appears floating in a glory of red winged angels to bless the young woman and announces her imminent death. At the instant she died, white, beautifully scented flowers blossomed forth from her bed of pain. The witnesses to this miracle are her old nurse and another woman, possibly a helpful neighbour.The neighbour greets the great Church Doctor hesitantly with a gesture of restrained fright. Behind her is a row of objects on a bench. One of the items leaning against the rear wall of the box-shaped room is a golden bowl, an object that seems out of place in this bleak scene.

33632-18sp1660.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 54.Rembrandt recorded his own likeness in at least 75 paintings, drawings, and prints, which date from his earliest years in Leiden to the last year of his life in Amsterdam. The dozens of painted examples clearly had many purposes, ranging from theatrical displays of emotional expression in the youthful works, to the most candid self scrutiny in some of the late canvases. A few self portraits were intended for great patrons, others no doubt for family members, and some must have been painted with no other viewer in mind, like pages in a diary. In this painting, a sober assessment of his appearance at the age of fifty-four, Rembrandt records light and textures with the objectivity of a still-life painter, an approach that makes the expression of his eyes and mouth all the more compelling

36997-marketga.jpg	"A farmyard in front of a well-appointed farmhouse, which rises up centrally in the background, with to the right a well and a small barn, and to the left in the distance a vegetable garden and a rural hamlet around a church, all set the scene for the busy occupations of the countryfolk in the foreground. Three women are preparing their vegetable harvest for market, assisted in the right background by a waggoner and watched on the left by a friendly-looking dog and a maid with a milking pail on her head and a pot with a handle in her hand. Behind her a peasant woman is letting cattle out of the barn whilst a lad is driving towards the herd a couple of sheep that have strayed into this attractive tableau, producing a light-hearted anecdote that links the various planes.The motif of the poster announcing the sale of the farm introduces a hint of uncertainty and of impending doom. Even so, the general impression of Siberechts' composition is that of an undisturbable natural order and rural calm. In doing so he touches a sensitive chord with the modern city-dweller. Country life already exercised a particular attraction on the painter's contemporaries, leading to the building of many country houses away from the cities. The dignity with which the country-folk are depicted is typical of Siberechts. There is no longer any hint of ""boorish"" behaviour - a proverbial term for the low appreciation in which a civilised bourgeoisie held country people and which expressed its dislike in many a vituperative tableau.Siberechts' noble peasants are often compared with those of France's Le Nain brothers. Possibly Siberechts drew inspiration for his noble portrayal from Brussels painter Michael Sweerts. For the motifs, such as the milkmaid carrying her heavy pail on her head, the reader is referred to her counterpart in Rubens' late landscapes. When it comes to the sculptural stateliness of Siberecht's figures, we should not forget that his father was a sculptor. This painting, the theme of which departs from his more usual ""Landscapes with Fords"", came into being in his Antwerp period, before the artist entered the service of the English aristocracy. An analogous work, the Farmyard, dated from 1662, is also conserved in the Brussels museum"

08979-01mill.jpg	The Mill is one of Claude's earliest paintings. In it he follows closely the example of Paul Bril, who developed in Rome the style of Late Mannerist landscape, with its artificial disposition of dark-brown foreground, lighter-green middle distance, and blue hills on the horizon, each stage being marked by wings as in a theatre, starting from a dark tree in the foreground. This artificiality of design was coupled with a stylized treatment of the detail, the trees in particular being painted in a set formula of frond-like branches. In The Mill there on the left is the regulation dark tree; the foreground is filled with incidents of the kind which Bril loved - boats in construction, fragments of ancient columns, and small figures, in this case artists sketching a boy milking a goat; on the right is a picturesque tower; behind it the trees form the next stage, and the hills close in the background. The Mannerist scheme is carried out even to the formula for the tree silhouettes

39749-14marsya.jpg	Titian worked on this painting in the summer of 1576, when Venice was devastated by a terrible plague which was to kill his favourite son Orazio. The iconography derives from a Giulio Romano fresco of the same subject in the Palazzo Te in Mantua, but Titian accentuates the terrifying savagery of the mythological scene through the churning background of ruddy browns, and the gloomy colours fitfully lit by sudden flashes of light.The meaning of the painting has been variously interpreted. It has been interpreted as the triumph of the divine art of Apollo and the stringed instrument over the rustic flute-playing satyr, or alternatively as representative of the spiritual cleansing brought about by the shedding of the Dionysian self. However, the presence of Titian himself, in the guise of King Midas, has favoured a reading of the painting as the painter's meditation on his own life

34398-louis_15.jpg	"This famous portrait is regarded as the very epitome of the absolutist ruler portrait. Yet it represents more than just power, pomp and circumstance. The sumptuous red and gold drapery is not only a motif of dignity, but also creates a framework that echoes the drapes of the ornate, ermine-lined robe. The blue velvet brocade ornamented with the golden fleurs-delis of the house of Bourbon is repeated in the upholstery of the chair, the cushion and the cloth draped over the table below it: the king quite clearly ""sets the tone"".A monumental marble column on a high plinth is draped in such a way that it does not detract from the height of the figure. Louis is presented in an elegantly angled pose, situated well above the standpoint of the spectator to whom he seems to turn his attention graciously, but without reducing the stability of his stance.Rigaud's consummate mastery of portraiture is particularly evident in the way he depicts the king's facial expression: his distanced unapproachability are not founded in Neoclassicist idealization, but in the candour of an ageing, impenetrable physiognomy. The lips are closed decisively and with a hint of irony, the eyes have a harsh, dark sheen, while the narrow nose suggests intolerance. This is a ruler who is neither good nor evil, but beyond all moral categories."

32752-01sebast.jpg	In this painting graceful Peruginesque poses and the hazy transparency of colour characteristic of Francesco Francia, are fused together in a way that clearly indicates Raphael's presence. His ability to compose clear and balanced forms becomes typical from this work on, as does the discreet and harmonious distillation of the formal elements of other painters in the clear, serene vision which seems characteristic of his artistic temperament.Sebastian is holding an arrow, the symbol of his martyrdom, his little finger held up elegantly. Wearing a gorgeous red cloak and a gold embroidered shirt, with his hair elegantly arranged, there is nothing about this figure that recalls the torments St Sebastian suffered for his faith.

38411-maidserv.jpg	This painting is not a portrait in the conventional sense. It is a tronie in which the figure represents a certain character or type. The Young Maidservant is among the largest of Sweerts's tronies which are all thought to have been painted in either Brussels or Amsterdam where the artist stayed between 1655 and 1661,Sweerts painted the maidservant with his typical mixture of realism and idealisation. Her body is turned to the left, while she looks over her shoulder to the right with a rather dreamy look, as if loss in thought. This painting has often been compared with Johannes Vermeer's iconic Girl with a Pearl Earring which is dated c. 1665, some five years after the present painting. Until 2011, the paintings by Sweerts and Vermeer were in fact displayed together in the Vermeer Room of the Mauritshuis

37925-skittle.jpg	This idyllic landscape, with skittle players and figures seated on the grass outside The White Swan inn, is an unusual subject for Jan Steen, who is best known as a painter of rowdy domestic and tavern interiors. Steen's work was unusual in its wide range of subject-matter in an age which encouraged specialization. Steen moved from town to town, and this apparent restlessness of temperament is reflected in the unevenness of his output. Often in financial difficulties, Steen was not above hack-work. At his best, however, as in this painting which probably dates from around 1660, Steen can rise to a level of technical skill and lyrical mood rarely achieved by even the greatest of Dutch painters.The early seventeenth century saw the rapid urbanization of the north Netherlands: Amsterdam, Leiden, Haarlem and The Hague were among the cities which underwent a huge expansion. It was a popular recreation for the citizens of Holland's overcrowded towns to visit inns in the countryside. In Les Delices de la Hollande, published in Leiden in 1678, the French author Parival commented on the popularity of such outings: ' 'Whenever one goes here [into the countryside], one finds as many people as would be seen elsewhere in a public procession. All these excursions end up at one of the inns which are to be found everywhere .... These inns are always packed with visitors, and the confused murmur of many voices is like the sound in a city square. These are inexpensive pleasures which all, even the humblest labourer, can share.' As can be seen from Steen's painting, some enterprising landlords provided entertainment for their customers, in this case skittles, which was a popular game in the Netherlands.

02619-04arella.jpg	The pair of Basket of Flowers on a Plinth, signed and dated 1664, now in the same private collection, was executed when Arellano was at the height of his powers and exemplifies the decorative and stylistic characteristics of his art that made his works so sought after by collectors in the 17th century.Arellano was able to maintain the interest of his admirers by varying the formats of his pictures. In the case of these works, he transformed one of his most popular picture types, the basket of freshly picked flowers, by perching the basket on the edge of semi-ruined classical style entablatures that act as plinths. In creating this architectural fantasy, Arellano borrowed the motifs from the prints of the classical architectural orders of Marcantonio Raimondi (1475-1539), representing in one painting a simplified version of a Corinthian entablature and in the other, an even more simplified version of this, without its frieze. These architectural features enter the pictures from opposite sides, thus allowing the works to flank a central element in a decorative scheme, and endow them with certain grandeur. The combination of ruins and flowers in these paintings heralds a picture type that became particularly popular in the following century

35742-waterfog.jpg	After Ruisdael had settled in Amsterdam about 1656-57 his compositions broaden, and a certain heaviness in the foreground disappears. The opening of the view suggests that he was impressed by Philips Koninck's panoramic views, but the fresh atmospheric effect, the brilliant glittering daylight which brightens the landscapes, the reflections, and vivid colours in the shadows are completely personal. In the late fifties Ruisdael also began to represent waterfalls in mountainous northern valleys, and in the sixties they became an important theme in his oeuvre. This motif was popularized by Allaert van Everdingen after he returned to Holland in 1644 from a trip to Norway and Sweden, and Ruisdael, who never visited Scandinavia, derived his torrential falls in northern landscapes from Everdingen's art

00007-michael.jpg	The archangel Michael was, like St. George the dragon-killer, one of the typically warlike saints so greatly approved in the age of chivalry. The Bible tells us that he fought with Satan for the body of Moses and we can read in the Apocalypse how he defeated the dragon with seven heads and ten horns. St. Michael was therefore looked upon as one of the principal patrons of the Church who, having overcome Satan, could protect all innocent souls from the Devil.This painting illustrates the somewhat provincial style of Juan de la Abadia of Huesca. The heritage of the Trecento can be seen in the delicate, girlish countenance of the saint and the brilliant tints of the wings, but blended with it is the elegance associated with the International Gothic style. The figures are wooden and lifeless and the artist's limited knowledge of anatomy may be seen in his representation of the soul; but the carefully arranged pattern of the floor creates the illusion of space, indicating that the artist was aware of the later developments of Gothic art and was to some extent influenced by early Renaissance art

He noted that the Palazzo Foscari which dominates the scene at the left was his home in Venice, and proceeded to discuss it in some detail, pointing out which rooms he used as his study and office, as well drawing attention to the presence of the chimney-sweep on the roof. Streit also described the ferry which crossed the canal, and the toll office for fish at the extreme right. Details such as these would have been of greater interest to residents of Venice than to visitors; the same could be said of the Campo di Rialto, a centre of commerce, which was the subject of another painting in the same group

02505-6elem2.jpg	The composition of the head out of various creatures, its profile view, approximate dimensions, and support all correspond to the series of Seasons and Elements. Earth is the most complex of either series. Like the other paintings in both series, it can be identified as an imperial allegory: this suggests that the emperor rules over the elements and the seasons.Many studies of animals by Arcimboldo exist, and many of these studies were used as sources for the creatures seen in Earth. All the animals in the head were taken from life, because the emperor gave Arcimboldo permission to draw creatures in his menageries.This version of the Earth was made for Maximilian II, or possibly Rudolf II. However, while there is no doubt about its authenticity, discrepancies with Water and Fire of 1566 do exist as far its dimensions, and more fluid handling are concerned, so it is possible that it might not have belonged to the original series of Elements

21648-zenobio1.jpg	The Villa Zenobio in Santa Bona Nuova, near Treviso, was built between 1673 and 1689 and was profoundly reworked during the mid-eighteenth century when the garden wing was erected. The small entrance portego was decorated in the early years of the eighteenth century by Gregorio Lazzarini.The wall surface is punctuated by a series of illusionistic, white Corinthian columns that stand on the low skirting board circling the perimeter of the room. The three white faux-rocaille frames that occupy the spaces between the columns contain scenes of poetic-mythological love stories, narrated in a neo-sixteenth-century pictorial manner, halfway between Titian and Veronese. The scenes depict Angelica and Medorus, Hercules and Omphale, and Rinaldo and Armida. The fresco on the ceiling, Eros Piercing a Young Woman, is now largely repainted.The frescoes were clumsily whitewashed with lime in the mid-nineteenth century, they were bought to light during a thorough restoration in the early twentieth century

09587-duomo0.jpg	Correggio accommodated the larger space of the octagonal cupola of Parma Cathedral by increasing the number of figures and the complexity of the design. A series of foreshortened figures acts as a device to visually lead the viewer up into the dome. Four gigantic saints provide a sense of support for the drum. As in the earlier frescoes for the cupola of San Giovanni Evangelista, Christ appears in the centre now much reduced in size, so as to emphasize a greater implied and actual distance.The fresco of the Assumption of the Virgin in the dome of the cathedral of Parma marks the culmination of Correggio's career as a mural painter. This fresco (a painting in plaster with water-soluble pigments) anticipates the Baroque style of dramatically illusionistic ceiling painting. The entire architectural surface is treated as a single pictorial unit of vast proportions, equating the dome of the church with the vault of heaven. The realistic way the figures in the clouds seem to protrude into the spectators' space is an audacious and astounding use for the time of foreshortening

08411-portgent.jpg	Sitting in an imposing armchair seen in three-quarter view is a gentleman of about seventy, who appears to have just been interrupted in reading the tiny book in his hand. The modest nature of the presentation, the firmness of the figure blocked in against the neutral background by a beam of light, and the austere palette of uniform, subdued tonalities reveal formal analogies with prototypes by Daniele Crespi and Tanzio da Varallo (and through these, with the more severe Spanish portraiture)			
37652-3gesu.jpg	The new church type, developed in the Baroque period, offered large format vertical picture surfaces on the inner fa�ade and on the dividing wall between the nave and the choir, which were used both for oil paintings and for frescoes. It was not as easy to see the pictures on the inner fa�ade because of the light from the windows, yet it was costumary to incorporate these surfaces into the iconographic program. The most magnificent solutions for this space were found in Naples. The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple on the entrance wall of the Chiesa del Ges&#249; Nuovo is perhaps the most spectacular of Solimena's wall paintings. It was routinely copied by northern artists visiting Naples in the eighteenth century, and was widely known from engraved reproductions. The scene can be understood as a reminder to viewers, in the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, that respectful behaviour was expected in sacred spaces, which explains why such scenes are so common on entrance walls in the Baroque period

32199-04bacch1.jpg	"There are two Bacchanals by Poussin in the Rome museum that are not actually pendants, as they are of different sizes. They are dated to 1626, on the basis of the interest that Poussin had at this time for the Bacchanals of Titian (the painter's enthusiasm is recorded by both Sandrart and Bellori). In both compositions Poussin ""animates"" putti borrowed from antique reliefs and shows them playing with objects also taken from antique friezes. The execution of these two paintings fits perfectly with Poussin's interests and production during his first Roman years in Rome. Along with his colleagues Sandrart, Duquesnoy, Pietro da Cortona, Claude Lorrain and others, Poussin studied and drew from the Bacchanals of Titian at the Palazzo Aldobrandini and the Villa Ludovisi. Poussin actually copied certain details directly from Titian's famous Bacchanal of the Andrians, for example the ""putto mingens"" at the left of the larger picture. Other motifs echo the style of Poussin's fellow Frenchman Duquesnoy, with whom the painter shared Roman living quarters in 1626"

03201-egypt.jpg	Even in his smaller canvasses which were painted for private chapels or collectors, Barocci abandoned the often cold calligraphy of the Mannerists. Instead, he favoured delicate images, rosy colours, soft light, and landscape settings. This did not mean that Barocci was not also a refined painter. Indeed, in a painting like this the way that the gestures and looks of the characters link to each other shows that he studied his compositions carefully. But what he did not do was to show off cleverness for its own sake. The way that he accurately describes a number of details (the fruits, the metal objects, or the items in the bottom left corner) foreshadows the imminent developments that would give rise to the new (for Italy) genre of still-lifes. This is yet another confirmation of Barocci's key role in a time of transition

06240-adorati1.jpg	According to Vasari, this small devotional painting was commissioned by Filippo di Averardo Salviati (1513-1572). It was most likely destined for a private chapel in the Salviati villa.This jewel-like painting displays the extreme refinement of execution and luxury of materials characteristic of Florentine Mannerism, with 'disegno' (drawing), sculptural modelling of forms, and enamel-like finish apparent  in every detail. The entire upper half of the composition is a deep landscape of lakes and hills, above which stretches a vast blue sky that Bronzino painted in expensive lapis lazuli.

42695-coastal2.jpg	This picture represents a Mediterranean coastal scene at sunset with figures fishing in the foreground. It is a typical composition from the painter's mature period with the design constructed around the principal compositional elements of the man of war, the rocky bluffs, the ruined tower, and the foreground occupied by fishermen or other spectators. These were all motifs that Vernet had developed as a result of his twenty-year stay in Italy between 1734 and 1753

36517-1table.jpg	Painted tabletops are decorated furniture, and surviving examples are almost all of South German origin. In its artistic quality and thematic wealth, Schaffner's tabletop may be considered the masterpiece of the genre.On a surface of a little more than one square metre he marshals a whole universe of astronomical-astrological and Christian-humanist symbolism. At the centre of the panel is a bright star, symbolising the divine light of the Creator, which illuminates the whole cosmos and around this revolve eight heavenly bodies. In accordance with the beliefs of the age, these are the seven planets - Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn - and a star that stands for the firmament. From these, rays radiate towards eight figures placed on a shelf that runs parallel to the edges and serves them as a stage, two figures sitting facing each other on each side. Identified in accompanying texts, one of these is Ptolemy, the others seven female figures, each personifying a multitude of meanings and each representing a planet, a colour, an art, a day of the week, a metal and a virtue. In this bundling together of different significations, the work is unique in the history of painting. On closer examination, we note that their order follows that of the days of the week, starting with Sunday. Behind the figures, on each of the four sides of the tabletop, are panoramic views characteristic of the lower Alps, cleverly blended at the corners to give the impression of a unified landscape spanned by a common sky

07161-canal202.jpg	This veduta is the pendant of the Grand Canal near the Rialto Bridge (private collection). Together they belong to the four paintings ordered by Stefano Conti. Taken from approximately the same vantage-point as its pendant, in this instance presumably at the corner of Palazzo Civran, it shows us the view to the north. On the left, next to the Fabbriche Vecchie, are the Fabbriche Nuove, with the campanile of San Cassiano behind them on the left; toward the middle of the composition the fish market and C&#224; Pesaro are silhouetted sharply against the sky. In the right foreground are the Palazzo Michiel, beyond them C&#224; d'Oro. In the distance, adjacent to Palazzo Vendramin Calergi in the middle of the scene, rises the campanile of San Marcuola.It can be assumed that Canaletto painted the pendant while sitting on the adjacent terrace. This would mean that the two paintings together span one hundred and eighty degrees, a semi-circle. At the same time, they can stand as entirely independent compositions. In the veduta under discussion, the receding walls on the opposite sides of the canal form, as it were, a narrow pivot, anchored on the white cloud which fans out in all directions; this cloud is the main binding element in the composition. The tower of San Cassiano on the left and the terrace on the right mark the edges on both sides, and both point in turn to San Marcuola in the distance.The composition sketch for this painting surfaced some years ago. Except for a few details in the arrangement of the ships, the drawing agrees completely with the painting. The shadows, too, are indicated precisely

40898-09virgin.jpg	The Virgin stands behind a wall which reaches to her waist and on which she has placed the Child on a cushion. The background is a landscape. The Virgin-and-Child type is copied from a Memling painting in the museum of Lisbon. The copyist changed the landscape and omitted the window niche which originally framed the Virgin. The format is also slightly smaller. Several variants of this composition which, as regards the Child, had been formulated by Van der Weyden (Caen, Mus�e municipal), can be found in Memling's oeuvre. The left wing of the Diptych of Maarten van Nieuwenhove (Memlingmuseum, Bruges) shows an almost identical type.The painting in Bruges, which has some affinities with the Master of the Legend of St Ursula (e.g. in the hands), was correctly ascribed to a Bruges master active around the end of the fifteenth century

But we reach the background only later, after having been attracted by the intense dramatic force of the group in the foreground. The Madonna holds the dead Christ in her lap, almost overwhelmed and bent down by the weight of her son's body that seems to slide away from her. Her face, faded by old age, appears worn out and exhausted through her suffering. Christ's abandonment, suggested by his hair hanging against the splendid, lenticular symbolic patch of grass (the Marian ""hortus conclusus"") which blooms behind the figures, is stiffened to the point of attaining a D�rer-like quality in the contorted hands.

The painting could contain an allusion to the five senses, and even Vanity: the clock dominates a composition in which the eye can gaze at appetizing objects, evoking smell and taste, hearing (the violin), touch (with the red material acting as tablecloth), and indeed sight, if we consider the painting as a whole.

Surrounded by an array of objects, it rests on a recorder with an incised letter A. The prominence of the skull, together with an array of vanitas objects such as the watch and extinguished oil lamp, suggest that the painting is what traditionally has been labeled a vanitas still-life. It reminds the viewer of the transience of human life and the ultimate futility of all human endeavours and worldly possessions, which here are represented by the books (knowledge), the musical instruments (pleasure), the sword (power and wealth), and the seashell (wealth).

42622-2710flut.jpg	Signature: Not signed.Provenance: This painting stems from the following collections: Jan Mahie van Boxtel en Liempde, Bois-le-Due; collection Maria de Grez-van Boxtel van Liempde, Brussels; collection Jhr. de Grez, Brussels. Noticed there by A. Bredius and exhibited in the Mauritshuis, The Hague, 1906-7. Collection August Janssen, Amsterdam. Art Gallery J. Goudstikker, Amsterdam, 1919. Art Gallery Knoedler, New York. Collection Joseph E. Widener, Philadelphia. Since 1942, in the museum.The Girl with a Flute depicts a young girl who is largely detached from the uncertain context of the picture. We see her from a very close angle, leaning on the edge of a table which has been foreshortened to the point where it looks more like a parapet. Again, her lips are lightly parted as she looks at us, as if she were about to speak to us. Her face, and in particular her eyes, are shadowed due to her wide, conical hat; it takes on the appearance of exotic chinoiserie. The way in which her face has been painted in shadow lends a touch of the enigmatic to her features.It is assumed by some critics that this painting is not by Vermeer, but one of the French fakes produced at the beginning of the nineteenth century. In this case it originates from the same faker's studio as the Girl with a Red Hat (National Gallery of Art, Washington).

30088-z_tomb.jpg	This panel once formed part of a predella made up of seven scenes from the life of Saint Proculus for an altarpiece, in the titular church in Florence, which belonged to the Benedictines of Badia. The altarpiece was dismembered probably in 1622. Six predella panels survive and are dispersed in various collections.Whereas the other scenes from the predella represent episodes from the saint's life, the present work records a posthumous episode: reportedly forty days after his death, a child placed under St Proculus's tomb was restored to life. Pacino depicts the moments before and after the child's resurrection - we see him pictured both beneath the tomb and in front of it, alongside the figures united in supplication and gratitude

42231-0217vela.jpg	Although Vel�zquez enjoyed life in Rome during his first visit to Italy, he feared the summer heat in the city, and consequently in May 1630 withdrew for two months to the secluded Villa Medici, which was also an ideal place for him to pursue his studies of classical antiquity. Here he produced two small landscapes of astonishing originality, which represents aspects of the gardens of the Villa Medici.During the previous decade, a few northern artists in Rome began to draw out of doors, continuing and expanding upon the practice of depicting ancient sites initiated by draftsmen of the sixteenth century. Vel�zquez's little paintings are derived from the plein air drawings of such artists as Paul Bril and Bartolomeus Breenburgh. However, they appear to have been among the first paintings made on site instead of in the studio. Vel�zquez appropriates the allusive technique of drawing to create almost palpable effects of light and atmosphere. Curiously, he was never again to paint a pure landscape, and thus these remarkable pictures can be interpreted as another example of experimental practices undertaken in Rome in order to expand his artistic horizons

24812-werl_l.jpg	The Werl Altarpiece was a triptych the central panel of which has been lost. The left wing depicts the donator  Heinrich von Werl, a theologian from Cologne, head of the Minorite Order, with St John the Baptist, the right wing St Barbara.Though long regarded as an authentic work by Robert Campin (the Master of Fl�malle), the altarpiece now is usually thought to be a pastiche by a follower. The bench on which St Barbara sits and the perspective of the whole room is taken over from Campin's Annunciation (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York); even the white towel and the ewer of water, symbolizing the Virgin's chastity, have been copied, though they are not the attributes of St Barbara. Her attribute, the tower in which she was imprisoned, is shown outside the window - typical of the way the early Netherlandish school rationalized abstract symbols naturalistically. In the left wing, the mirror on the wall is borrowed from Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Marriage in the National Gallery in London, painted four years earlier

02932-holyfami.jpg	Badalocchio, who was born in Parma, probably trained in the Carracci academy in Bologna, and then worked with Agostino Carracci in the service of Ranuccio Farnese in Parma. On Agostino's death he went, with Giovanni Lanfranco, to Rome to work as an assistant of Annibale on the walls of the Galleria Farnese. On Annibale's death in 1609, Badalocchio returned to his native city. His artistic personality was relatively obscure until the 1950s, in part because of his dependence on Annibale's example.The influences of both Parma and Rome are evident in this picture. The Virgin rests against a wall, apparently pausing during the flight into Egypt, cradling the infant Christ, while St Joseph keeps watch. A notable feature is the exquisite still-life of a basket of fruit.The picture was first recorded in the Farnese collection, where, in 1653, it was attributed to Lanfranco. Subsequently, it was attributed to Ludovico Carracci, and it was only in 1958 that the correct attribution to Badalocchio was proposed. The monumentality of form and the intimate use of expression owe much to Annibale's teaching, as does the classical landscape which frames the composition. In these respects the picture can be compared with Albani's contemporary Rest on the Flight. However, the handling of colour and light suggest that Badalocchio was also influenced by the art of Parma, especially that of Correggio and Bartolomeo Schedoni (then court painter to Ranuccio Farnese), suggesting that it was executed shortly after his departure from Rome. A copy of this painting, extended at the left to include two angels, once hung alongside it in the Farnese collection in Rome, and is now in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples

43709-grandmot.jpg	Waldm�ller was the most important Austrian painter of the Biedermeier period during the first half of the nineteenth century. Within his lifetime he established a reputation in America, and there was a major exhibition of his work in London in 1862. He was proficient in most aspects of painting - miniatures, landscape, portraits and genre. His career within the art establishment was successful, but not without controversy. Appointed Professor at the Academy in Vienna in 1829, he was an advocate of realist painting and of reform, which led to his temporary dismissal from the post from 1857-64. Nonetheless, Waldmiiller was an effective teacher, an influential theorist, and an immensely popular artist within Viennese society and at court. His success as a painter stemmed from his powers of observation, from his measured style and his wholly sympathetic treatment of subject matter. The accumulation and faithful recording of detail led to an idealism based on the subject matter itself, as opposed to one imposed upon it by an outside order, this being a vital distinction between eighteenth- and nineteenth-century art.Rustic genre was the last theme that Waldm�ller essayed. The subjects he chose extolled the moral virtues of rural life, or, as here, the joys of family life. The care taken over the rendering of garments, the still life and the surroundings is offset by the radiance of the figures' expressions, reinforced by their gestures which create a circular composition of great tenderness. Waldm�ller was well-versed in the tradition of the Old Masters and the composition has affinities with several paintings by Raphael of the Holy Family - the Madonna Canigiani (Munich, Alte Pinakothek), the Madonna dell'Impannata (Florence, Palazzo Pitti), the Madonna of Francis I (Paris, Louvre) and the Madonna della Perla (Madrid, Prado). Waldm�ller's homage to Raphael, however, is seen through the eyes of Correggio

03612-73reconc.jpg	On 5 April 1529 Beccafumi was commissioned to paint the ceiling of a large room on the first floor of the Palazzo Pubblico. Now known as the Sala del Concistoro, it appears that it became the meeting place of this magistracy only after the remodelling of the Palazzo Pubblico in the seventeenth century. Designated as the sala dipinta (the 'painted room') on an early seventeenth- century plan of the building, it is likely that it was originally designed as a room for the reception of foreign embassies and similar ceremonial events. Despite being required to complete the work within eighteen months and receiving payments for it in May and August 1530 and October 1532, Beccafumi left this elaborate scheme of painting unfinished in order to go to work for another patron, Andrea Doria, in Genoa. He then resumed the project in 1534, receiving final payment for it on 21 April 1535. Thus, a project that was meant to have taken only eighteen months in fact took six years to complete.Beccafumi's frescoes on the ceiling of the Sala del Concistoro are complex in their subject matter and imagery. The ceiling is comprised of a large rectangular centrepiece surrounded on all four sides by a deep cove. The subjects of the paintings on the cove of the ceiling are all drawn directly from the Roman author Valerius Maximus's Memorable Deeds and Sayings.The painting of the Reconciliation of Marcus Emilius Lepidus and Fulvius Flaccus dominates the west side of the ceiling. Representing the peace made between a powerful consul and his principal enemy, the subject was chosen to illustrate a notable act of benevolence and good will in ancient Roman history. Set in an orderly and impressive rendition of the Campo Marzio in Rome, with temples and other ancient civic buildings in the background, the two protagonists are represented embracing one another in a dignified manner. Other figures witness this scene including two animated youths to the left of the kneeling consuls. A bearded man on the extreme right looks directly out towards the spectator and may be a portrait of the painter himself. If this is the case, it appears that this particular painting was of some significance for the scheme as a whole. It is the first painting to draw one's attention as one enters the room since it lies directly opposite the entrance door. In colour, perspective and luminosity, it also functions as an eye- catching painting within the generally rich embellishment of the ceiling as whole.In many ways, the ceiling of the Sala del Concistoro represents the culmination of sixteenth-century Sienese civic art. Although completed by 1535 and therefore twenty years before the fall of the Sienese republic, it provides another compelling demonstration of the traditional yet also innovatory characteristics of Sienese painting at that time

32274-03landsc.jpg	In the Campanian landscape Matthew the Evangelist is sitting on a stone amongst the ruins of ancient buildings, harkening to an angel who stands before him. A painting of St John on Patmos, of similar design and equal size, in the Art Institute of Chicago was originally a companion-piece to the one in Berlin; they probably formed part of an unfinished series of landscapes with the four Evangelists. The two paintings appear to have parted company at an early stage. Unforeseen circumstances seem to have prevented the completion of the series. Cardinal Francesco Barberini, who presumably commissioned Poussin to paint the pictures (this work is mentioned in an inventory of the Palazzo Barberini of 1692), was forced to flee Rome in 1645, following the death of his uncle, Pope Urban VIII; this would have been reason enough for the painter to leave the series unfinished, in which case the St Matthew landscape must have been the only one the Cardinal actually received, and the second picture sold to another buyer. This would suggest that both pictures were painted before or around 1645, this date being borne out by the development of Poussin's style, for he had just returned to Italy after a luckless interlude as Court painter in Paris.In the Berlin painting Poussin has introduced realistic impressions of nature, deriving ostensibly from the Tiber valley at Aqua Acetosa not far from Rome. But there is no question of an exact reproduction of the topographical features, such as the North European artists in Italy so often tried to achieve. As in all Poussin's works, the composition here is essentially imaginative: the double bend of the river conveys the full depth of the valley, while the soaring tower of a distant ruin is the dominant vertical feature of the landscape, lending emphasis to the quiet dialogue between Evangelist and angel; his own features shaded, Matthew looks up at the divine messenger who stands bathed in a bright light. The remains of the building material, stones cut in cubic and cylindrical forms, not only provide depth and perspective but also lend a note of gravity to this heroic landscape, and are so placed as to achieve the maximum artistic effect.At the end of the eighteenth century this painting formed part of a legacy to the Colonna di Sciarra family, and its presence in their palazzo was confirmed in 1820.

33561-090portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 437.There are overtones in this picture of the biblical subject of either Bathsheba or Susanna and the Elders; this much is made clear by the heavy gold and red cloak behind the figure and by the grotto-like setting. At least in these areas, Rembrandt was seeking to create a romantic effect. Still, as is so often the case in his work, the dividing line between a religious subject and a product of the artist's fancy, with no particular subject intended, is a fine one. The young woman appears completely absorbed in her bathe and shows no sign of the reactions appropriate to either Susanna or Bathsheba. As a work of art, the picture has all the characteristics of an independent study, or a sketch made for its own sake, and the figure, if not the background, was evidently painted from life. The brushstrokes are dashing and impulsive, suggesting rather than defining the forms; except in the head and flesh-parts of the figure, no attention at all is paid to detail. The abiding impression is one of spontaneity and freedom.The small Woman bathing in a Stream is so tenderly intimate, so informal in pose and spontaneous in technique that it appears at first sight like the record of an actual experience: Rembrandt's mistress Hendrickje Stoffels wading in a stream. But the gold and crimson robe lying on the bank suggests that the bathing woman should be read as a biblical or mythological figure, Susanna, Bathsheba or Diana. The year of the painting, 1654, was also the year when Hendrickje, whom we recognise from other pictures, suffered public humiliation because of her liaison with the artist and bore him their only child. Re-casting a personal and sensuous image of a loved sitter in traditional guise was a seventeenth-century convention, and the ambiguous narrative could add resonance to the real-life relationship. The apocryphal heroine Susanna innocently aroused sexual desire in the old men who falsely accused her; Bathsheba's beauty (2 Samuel 10) tempted King David into mortal sin; seeing Diana bathing in the woods cost the hunter Actaeon his life

35946-3utrech1.jpg	Trained in Haarlem in the studio of a history painter and portraitist, Saenredam turned the more rigorously intellectual speciality of architectural painting, prized by contemporaries for demonstrating the universal laws of mathematics and optics. The metaphysical nature of these sciences was underlined through the light-flooded church interiors which were his preferred subject.Working closely with the architect Jacob van Campen, Saenredam is the first major artist to have used the methods of architectural surveyors. His paintings of churches throughout the Northern Netherlands are based on meticulous perspectival drawings, or cartoons, of the same size as the picture, derived from sketches and measurements taken 'in situ'. Absolute fidelity was often later sacrified for greater effect, however, as the paintings were executed in the studio, sometimes years afterwards. The original drawing, of which this picture shows only the right half, is dated 16 August 1636; another painting (now in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth) corresponding to the left half dates 1645.Like all of Saenredam's church interiors, this view of the Buukerk, originally the only parish church in Utrecht, shows a medieval building stripped of all vestige of Catholic decoration and whitewashed to the requirements of Protestant worship. Positioned with the artist at the north door, we look into the nave. Most of the surviving structure is fourteenth, or fifteenth century, but Saenredam has deliberately chosen to focus on the Gothic remnants of the thirteenth-century edifice, exaggerating the height of the columns. Hanging on one of these in the centre is a guild board; in the recess of the pier on the right are the Tables of the Ten Commandments, and above them the bust of Moses. Higher on the same pier are heraldic mementoes. Below, drawn in red chalk evidently by the standing child, is a crude illustration of a medieval tale of chivalry popular throughout most of Europe and recently published in Dutch. It shows the sons of Amyon of Dordogne on the magic horse Bayard. Beneath the drawing is an inscription with the name of the church, the date and the artist's signature.The figures in Saenredam's paintings are not always by him.They do not appear in the drawings and are included to give a sense of the building's scale, to provide colour accents and human interest, but they may also underline the picture's deeper significance. We may never know precisely what is intended by the group in the foreground here. The second boy is training a dog to stand on its hind legs, a Dutch emblem of obedience and the capacity to learn. Perhaps the painting could be viewed as a pictorial metaphor for the famous verses of St Paul contrasting worldly blindness with the full clarity of vision in Heaven (I Corinthians 13:10-12)

It was decided that the Northern and Southern Netherlands should be amalgamated into a single kingdom, as a buffer against France, with the Prince of Orange as King William I.In order to assume the power relinquished by the French in 1813, a three-man provisional government was formed on behalf of the Prince of Orange under Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp, who is shown sitting at the table.

03073-wings.jpg	Hendrik van Balen was an Antwerp artist and the teacher of Anthony van Dyck. He mainly painted religious and mythological scenes. He specialized in human figures and was often asked to add staffage to landscapes painted by his colleagues.The two panels, Virgin and Child with Angels and John the Baptist rebuking King Herod, served originally as the shutters of a triptych. The centre panel, St John Preaching to the Multitude, is no longer in the cathedral.The left wing shows angels preparing Jesus' bath. One of them is about to take the Infant from his mother's arms, while another carries a basin and a third angel a pair of towels. Other little angels look down from a cloudy sky. The charming scene prefigures the Baptism of Christ by John the Baptist. By using such a familiar scene from everyday life, the artist was able to intensify the spiritual appeal to the ordinary viewer.The scene in the right wing is much more dramatic. Inside a classical palace, John the Baptist rebukes Herod Antipas, the King of Palestine, for his adulterous marriage to Herodias, who witnesses the confrontation with a lady-in-waiting. The preacher duly paid for his accusations with his life

06306-work.jpg	"Ford Madox Brown had a wide knowledge of continental history painting, but had been particularly impressed by the medievalism of the Nazarenes. His early pictures show him trying to combine such medievalism with the naturalist tradition, giving his work a vigour that was readily appreciated by the younger Pre-Raphaelites.This ambitious composition can be described as a ""real allegory."" To paint his chosen location (in the north London suburb of Hampstead), he had carried his huge canvas and set it up in situ throughout the summer of 1852. Hence the sunlight that illuminates some of the protagonists (the ""navvies,"" the orphans with their big sister, and, in the distance on the right, the people carrying election posters), while  in the shade of the trees the artist portrays a wealthy couple on horseback and, on the other side of the railings, a family of Irish tramps.

09096-st_anne.jpg	"Antwerp experienced an extraordinary economic boom around 1500. The export of luxury goods grew so fast that many artists came to establish themselves there ""... because art loves the company of wealth"". The painter Joos van der Beke, also known as Joos van Cleve, was enrolled in 1511 as a master painter in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. Most of his fruitful career took place in Antwerp.The scene of St Anne with the Virgin and Child and St Joachim presents three generations: the grandparents, the mother and the infant Jesus. Although the present panel may well have come from a place of worship, this type of popular representation is mainly intended for private devotion. Van Cleve's command of space, colour and light is masterly. The balanced composition with the central figure of St Anne is placed in an equilateral triangle. In the centre, the most important element, lies the infant Jesus, comfortably asleep in his grandmother's lap. Although the divine family forms the centre, attention is immediately drawn to the two wide landscapes onto which the loggia opens: a small, moated castle, some houses, a dovecote. The interior displays considerable wealth: Anne sits enthroned in front of a 'mille-fleurs' tapestry, hung between two porphyry columns with bronze Corinthian capitals. The fabrics are also richly reproduced, with the women's red and blue gold-hemmed mantles standing out strongly against Joachim's fur-lined overcoat. The figure of Joachim is somewhat puzzling. Until now he was regarded by all authors as being Joseph. The rich dress and the clearly painted purse hardly fit with the poor carpenter, but with Anne's first husband, who was indeed a wealthy man. When he arrived at the temple in Jerusalem, the high priest refused his gold coins because he was childless. This makes the purse on the belt an allusion to the refused offering.The balanced composition and the collected expressions of the figures radiate an unprecedented serenity that points to Italian influence. More than many of his contemporaries, Van Cleve was open to all kinds of influence, not only of artists from his vicinity such as Quentin Massys, but also to Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht D�rer"

36940-bathers1.jpg	The Bathers at Asni�res, at two by three metres a demonstratively large work, was Seurat's first programmatic picture. The location was not far out, like Argenteuil or Bougival, but close to newly built factories. There was no restaurant, and those who bathed there went because the rail fare to Argenteuil was too expensive. Fourteen surviving oil studies and a number of drawings show how meticulously Seurat prepared the painting. The atmosphere one of hazy brightness, the sky and water almost constitute a single colour continuum, which powerfully diminishes the spatiality of the work. The figures look exhausted, their three-dimensionality has an inflated look, and the outlines of the colour zones are sharp. These outlines are not marked by actual lines, though, but solely by the different colours of tiny brush-strokes or by an aura of light.The scientifically precise rendering of colours of this carefree genre scene and sunny landscape admittedly introduces a disquieting note of ornamentality, involving as it does the uncompromising use of a technique that has no time for unimportant details

18885-virgin_c.jpg	Guercino was summoned to Rome by a Bolognese patron elected pope in 1621. After a heady start, he was evidently intimidated by the example of High Renaissance painting and by the work of his competitors, the Bolognese Reni and Domenichino among them, and adopted a classicising style which relied less on shadow, bold foreshortenings and study from life. With the death of the pope in 1623 he returned to Cento, where he pursued a successful career providing easel paintings to clients throughout Europe. He resisted offers from the French and English kings to work at their courts. After the death of Reni he moved to Bologna where he became the leading painter. In the best works from this late period of his life, he contrived to emulate Reni's cool elegance without compromising his own gifts as both colourist and draughtsman.This painting was commissioned in 1649 by Francesco I d'Este to replace Correggio's Madonna with St George in the church San Pietro Martire in Modena. The represented saints are the patron saints of Modena, Sts Geminianus, John the Baptist, George, and Peter the Martyr

34325-2colonna.jpg	The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).The most important room in the palace is the gallery (Grande Galleria) on the second floor of the south wing. It is more than a story and a half in height, and it receives light from both sides. It has two separate anterooms, marked off from the main space by pairs of columns. These extensions and the wall arrangements of the room with large pilasters produced the most magnificent secular space from the Roman Baroque.The painting of the gallery was begun in 1665 and lasted until 1685. The pictorial program unfolds in the vaults of the trio of rooms and it is supplemented to this day with the original statues, paintings, and elaborate furnishings. The paintings of the two anterooms (Sala Inferiore at the west and Sala Superiore at the east) was commissioned after 1689 by Filippo I Colonna, the oldest son of Lorenzo Onofrio. The west anteroom was painted by the young Sebastiano Ricci in 1693-95 with the Allegory of Marcantonio Colonna's Victory at Lepanto. In the east anteroom Giuseppe Chiari painted in 1698-1700. the Apotheosis of Marcantonio Colonna

The allegorical theme can be described as the following: in the darkness of his study, with sad awareness, a young gentleman tempered by philosophical studies - the volume on which he has placed his left hand - is meditating about death, represented by the two skulls. Behind him, a girl futilely tries to get his attention, while in front of  him an older man, possibly his teacher, looks at him sympathetically.The nocturnal scene is Honthorst's invention, the Utrecht painter's influence is powerful in this work

14144-05p_parc.jpg	Fragonard used light and atmosphere to absorb people and objects until one is left with an airy, empty but still vibrating, surface; it is as if a conjuring trick had been played over some painting by Boucher, from which so much 'reality' has been abstracted. For both Fragonard and the Guardi, this is an escape from the discipline represented by Boucher and Tiepolo, but it is given an additional twist by Fragonard's knowledge and admiration of Tiepolo - the wilder genius anyway, but one become wilder and more romantic in Fragonard's interpretations of his compositions. Just as Veronese had provided Tiepolo with material out of which to build his own fantasy, so Tiepolo stimulated Fragonard.Fragonard is a romantic rococo painter, inspired more perhaps by the picturesque aspects of nature than by people, who are usually dwarfed into insignificance beside the foaming trees which shoot up like great jets in his landscapes. When this Francesco Guardi-like diminution does not take place, Fragonard seems to produce a version of Gian Antonio's style, in which figures become mere arabesques of paint, animated but often faceless, tight balls of energy that shoot about the canvas under the impulse of his brush. In both styles they remain the painter's puppets, and one is always conscious of manipulation. Although capable of doing so, he is really too eager to stop and record natural appearances, actual textures, or facial expressions.This charming parkscape is composed from drawings made in the gardens of the Villa d'Este in Tivoli in 1760

00208-phaeton1.jpg	The picture shows the view of the Galleria, looking south. Between the doors the scene depicting the Sirens is visible. Vincenzo Giustiniani (1564-1637) was one of the most brilliant, and knowledgeable lovers of art in early seventeenth-century Rome. He assembled a renowned collection of roughly 1.800 works of classical sculpture and 600 paintings, among them eleven of Caravaggio's most important works. He purchased a villa at Bassano Romano in 1595 which was then thoroughly remodeled and enlarged. The artists who painted there between 1595 and 1604 all worked in the Mannerist style.The north wing of the enlarged palace was erected in 1607-09 and the painted decoration was accomplished in 1609-10. There are three rooms in the north wing, the Sala della Felicit&#224; Eterna (painted by Paolo Guidotti in 1610), the Sala di Diana (painted by Domenichino in 1609) and the Galleria (painted by Francesco Albani and assistants in 1609-10).In the Galleria, Albani painted the legend of Phaethon, the youth who disrupted the path of the sun. The protagonists in Albani's wall pictures are seen reacting with violent gestures and upward gazes at the central event of the fall of Phaethon on the ceiling. The entire Phaethon legend, as related in Ovid's Metamorphoses, is illustrated on the ceiling and walls in episodes that are part dramatic, part lyrical. Albani designed the eight scenes on the walls as imaginary tapestries.Albani's cycle was highly praised through the whole of the eighteenth century. Later the Phaethon cycle and its painter came to be forgotten, and have only now rediscovered by art historian and appreciated anew

On the largest wall of the room he finished the huge Crucifixion in 1565, then for the other walls, in 1566-67 he painted three more canvases related to the Passion of Christ (Christ before Pilate, Crowning with Thorns, Christ Carrying the Cross).

13676-flowers1.jpg	"One of the best-known still-life painters of the 17th century, Juan Fern�ndez was particularly admired for his paintings of grapes. He was an unconventional figure for his time in being an artist who lived in the countryside and worked the land, from which activity he derived the nickname by which he was best known, ""El Labrador"". However, in the later years of the 1620s, El Labrador became a protege of Giovanni Battista Crescenzi, Marquis of la Torre (1577&#151;1635), the Roman nobleman and painter with a marked interest in still-life painting. Crescenzi may also have promoted his works among collectors at the court of Madrid, as well as the English ambassador Sir Francis Cottington and his secretary Arthur Hopton, who became aficionados of his still-lifes.El Labrador's flower paintings appear to have been the result of the direct intervention of one of his patrons. In February 1635, Arthur Hopton wrote to Cottington in London that he had persuaded the artist to try his hand at flower paintings, which he had not yet seen, in the hope that these would turn out as well as his fruit still-lifes. While the season of winter would not appear to be propitious to the beginning of a career as a flower painter, it is likely that El Labrador used his own cultivated blooms to paint these pictures. Hopton could not have been disappointed by the remarkable results of his patronage in paintings such as the Vase of Flowers (Private Collection) which El Labrador signed and dated 1636 on the reverse, or the flower piece reproduced here.In this piece El Labrador has painted the flowers in strong light against a dark background and this has almost bled the pink rose of colour in the highlights. The darkened, discoloured leaves at the base of the arrangement are due to chemical changes that can be seen in other still-life paintings by the artist, perhaps symptomatic of an insufficient artistic training. This floral arrangement, unusually, is made up of relatively few flowers: lilies, a pink rose and carnations."

15942-tramonto.jpg	Very little is known about Giorgione: only a handful of contemporary documents refer to him, and only some six or seven surviving paintings are now considered 'almost certainly' by him. Yet he is universally accepted as one of the most influential of Western artists. Probably trained by Giovanni Bellini, he originated a poetic painting of mood, based on colour, light and a new vision of landscape, which we still call 'Giorgionesque'. Although we attribute to him an altarpiece in his native town of Castelfranco, a ruined nude figure in fresco detached from a building in Venice which he and Titian decorated, and two portraits inscribed with his name in the sixteenth century, he seems to have specialised in small, enigmatic 'subject' pictures like this one for private collectors. Whether or not the picture, which was rediscovered, badly damaged, in 1933 in a sixteenth-century villa in Poste Casale, south of Venice, is by Giorgione himself is not very important to us as viewers; it is certainly 'Giorgionesque'.The Italian title, Il Tramonto, captures the painting's special temper better than the English translation, for in Italian the sun sets literally 'beyond the mountain'. Within a deep landscape meeting the horizon in a startling band of blue, two travellers halt besides a pool, from whose murky waters a little beaked monster emerges.A hermit inhabits the dark cave on the far side. The mounted Saint George in the middle distance is a restorer's reconstruction, added in 1934 to cover an area of flaking paint, and to account for what appears, in a photograph of the period, to be the vestigial tail of a dragon. Other reconstructed areas include the larger monster in the water. The modern additions make unsafe any reading of the picture's intended meaning. If Saint George was originally present, the hermit may be Anthony Abbot a saint distressed with sores, protector against epidemics - of whom it was told that demons in the shape of monsters came at nightfall to 'tear his body with teeth, with horns, and with claws'. The two men in the foreground may be Saint Roch, a medieval French pilgrim who caught the plague while nursing the sick, and his companion Gothardus tending the ulcer on the saint's leg. The body of Saint Roch, one of the main protectors against pestilence, is one of Venice's great relics.If we compare II Tramonto with, for example, Patenier's landscape painted a few years later , it is possible to understand the great impact of Giorgione's work. For all its artificiality, this landscape invites us to enter it in imagination; the construction, in wedge-shaped planes alternately light and dark, stresses continuity from foreground through well-defined intervening space to the blue horizon. The wispy tree in the centre, like the cliff and foliage on either side, pushes back the far from the near. Soft gradations from shadow into light, contours and reflections blurred as if by haze, the isolated and mysterious figures, the barely visible, perhaps imaginary monsters, the alpine town in the distance, combine to create a sense of profound yet indefinable emotion, as 'Brightness falls from the air...' Thomas Nashe's haunting line may be more than visually apt: it comes from a poem entitled 'In Time of Pestilence'

42174-foundin.jpg	This fresco is located on the east wall of the Pellegrinaio in the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala. The Pellegrinaio is a fourteenth-century room which took the form of a long vaulted hall situated on the ground floor of the hospital.Vecchietta was entrusted with painting the first in the series of paintings on the east wall that illustrated scenes in the Spedale's history. This was the Vision of St Sorore (The Founding of the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala).In this painting Vecchietta set the complex scene in what appears to be a vaulted church. This allowed him to place the central narrative event within the nave of this church. Here the cobbler, Sorore, the mythical founder of the Spedale, is shown describing to one of the canons of the cathedral the vision that his mother was alleged to have experienced before his birth. Behind these two figures, in the space of the domed crossing, appears the vision itself - the Virgin welcoming infants who have reached heaven by climbing up the hospital's emblem of a ladder. The right-hand aisle of the church, meanwhile, acts as the setting for the first occasion when Sorore brought a foundling to one of the cathedral canons and received money for the upkeep of the child. The entire edifice is fronted by an impressive fa�ade whose style with its antique detail of fluted piers, ornate capitals and frieze is unequivocally Renaissance. Perspective has been employed to great effect, both on the pavement of the church and in the recession of the building itself.The complete description of the frescoes in the Pellegrinaio can be found in the section of Domenico di Bartolo, who executed six of the surviving eight frescoes of the hall

In a daybook the brothers kept they recorded the amount of work each did on a picture and then computed its price upon the basis of their calculations. Pieter also copied his brother's work.This painting was commissioned by Stadholder Frederik Hendrik for his residence at Honselaerdijk as one of a series of paintings on pastoral themes.Granida and Daifilo were lovers from the Dutch pastoral play Granida (1605) by Pieter Hooft. Granida, the daughter of an eastern king, betrothed to Prince Tisiphernes, lost her way while out hunting. She came upon a shepherd Daifilo and his mistress Dorilea who had just quarrelled. Daifilo fetched water for the princess to drink and fell in love with her. He followed her to court and, after several turns in the story, they fled to the woods together to live a pastoral life. Daifilo was taken prisoner by one of Granida's several suitors. They were finally reunited after the intervention of Tisiphernes who yielded his claim to her. The play set a fashion for pastoral idyll in the Netherlands and long remained popular.In Werff's representation the lovers are depicted in a woodland setting

In its compositionally significant position on the central axis of the picture, the copper urn is the main attraction of the quiet scene and its central motif. What may at first sight seem to be a random detail extracted from a larger context is in fact a composition as calculated as it is convincing. The modern connoisseur of this painting will not be looking through indifferent eyes at a piece of hydraulic equipment.

18066-11scene.jpg	"St Augustine is seen at the very moment he is baptized, kneeling in prayer before the pillars of a baptistery behind a rectangular basin filled with water, on which the picture's date of origin has been recorded: ADI PRIMO DAPRILE MILLE CCCCLXIIII (1 April 1464). He is surrounded by his followers, including his mother who is standing behind him. The clergyman holding the newly baptized man's clothing is thought to be a portrait of Domenico Strambi, the man who commissioned the cycle.The Baptism of St Augustine was, according to the ""Legenda Aurea"" or Golden Legend, carried out at Easter 378 by St Ambrose in Milan with the words ""te Deum laudamus"" (we praise you as [our] God), to which St Augustine replied ""te Dominum confitemur"" (we recognize your as [our] Lord). This liturgical hymn of thanksgiving, the ""Te Deum"", is mentioned in the ""Legenda Aurea"" as being a song of praise between St Ambrose and St Augustine. In the medieval liturgy, the ""Te Deum"" was sung as the conclusion of Matins the midnight office, and on ceremonial liturgical occasions. The melody is one of the oldest Gregorian chants.

It was commissioned by Jean-Philippe d'Orl�ans (1702-1748), the Grand Master or Grand Prieur of the Knights of the Order of Malta in France for the decoration of his Parisian residence the Palais du Temple.Of the seven paintings of the decoration, recorded by his biographers, only three are now known representing cardinal virtues, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice. The present work was the first of the three, and was installed in the Salon of the Temple early in 1737.The painting is called Madame Ad�laide as Justice, because the sitter was assumed to be Madame Ad�laide, daughter of Louis XV.

00252-visitat4.jpg	This signed and dated painting is an autograph variant of Albertinelli' most celebrated work, the Visitation in the Uffizi, Florence, which is dated 1503 but not signed. Just five years after executing the Uffizi prototype, which shows the undeniable influence of Perugino in its use of soft highlights and its inclusion of a classical arcade, the artist returned to the subject using the same cartoon but introduced some fundamental differences to the design: the architectural niche and the landscape have been removed and two additional figures have been introduced. While the central figures may wear robes different in colour and detail from the prototype, they are very much faithful to the original in their harmonious pyramidal design which balances both movement and stasis. Interestingly, the face of Elizabeth in the present work is no longer in shadow as it is in the Uffizi version.The lateral figures may be the work of Giuliano Bugiardini, who is known to have rented quarters next to Albertinelli in 1503 and began assisting him shortly thereafter

39755-04udith.jpg	This masterpiece, one of the finest and most poetical of Titian's creations, is unanimously dated by the critics at around 1515. The main focus is on neither the horrific events nor the religious significance of the scene. It is not even clear if this is Salome with the head of the Baptist, or Judith with the head of Holofernes. The former is suggested by the displaying of the head on a platter, the latter by the presence of the female servant who is a feature of the traditional iconography of the Judith story.Both at the time when the painting was in the collection of the Duchess of Urbino, and later, when it belonged to the Aldobrandini family, it was believed to depict Herodias, Herod's wife and the mother of Salome. However, a number of foreign visitors who had an opportunity to see Titian's painting in the Villa Aldobrandini at Montecavallo thought it to be a representation of Judith. This common belief is also reflected in modern historiography. In fact, if the figure in the painting were Herodias, dressed here in bright red, carrying the head of John the Baptist on a tray, then the girl in the green dress on her right would have to be Salome. Yet there is nothing regal about the two women, while the seductive attitude of the main figure is well suited to the Jewish heroine Judith, a rich and attractive widow who, with her oppressor Holofernes decapitated, now holds the head with the assistance of her maid. This theme was often treated as a symbol of virtue.That this interpretation of the subject may be the correct one is also confirmed by the fact that there is a 1533 record of a Judith by Titian in the collection of Alfonso I d'Este. Considered lost, there cannot be the slightest doubt that it is this painting, which comes in fact from the collection of Lucrezia d' Este, granddaughter of Alfonso I.The painting, with its wonderful colour contrasts of red, green, and white, and its delightful female figures, is one of Titian's depictions of an ideal of female beauty. This is why it was frequently copied.

The Wan-Li vase is an allusion to flourishing trade with the East and the rare flowers of the wealth and prosperity it had brought. The outer petals of the red and yellow tulip are just beginning to curl back and those of the rose are very slightly browning at their edges.

41379-07dipty1.jpg	Two panels, The Dead Christ and the Virgin (National Gallery, London) and Sts John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) originally formed a diptych which may have been commissioned by Queen Sancia of Naples (1286-1345), the wife of King Rene of Anjou, who was particularly devoted to Mary Magdalene and was the founder of Santa Chiara.The combination of the Man of Sorrows and the Virgin with John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene in a diptych is unique. It was usual from the thirteenth century onwards to represent the Man of Sorrows in one wing with the Virgin and Child in the other.Giotto was called to Naples by Robert of Anjou in 1328. He took with him a number of painters who had worked with him on the frescoes in the Lower Church of San Francesco, Assisi. The diptych was likely painted by a member of Giotto's workshop in Naples, who was active on the frescoes in the Church of Santa Chiara. Giotto's Neapolitan workshop may have continued to operate after he returned to Florence in 1333

21271-bacchus.jpg	At the royal ch&#226;teau of Marly, La Fosse shared a commission around the turn of the century for a set of Four Seasons with Louis de Boullongne, Antoine Coypel, and Jouvenet. While Jouvenet was suitably assigned the male subject of Winter, La Fosse no less suitably dealt with Autumn, in the persons of Bacchus and Ariadne. This is no dramatic encounter of god and mortal girl but, La Fosse shows them in happy, graceful dialogue, and amused rather than disturbed by the loyal barking of Ariadne's pet dog. It is the picture's glowing, half-autumnal tonality, not its somewhat inert composition, that makes it attractive, combined with its sensuous paint surface

04148-amexchan.jpg	The expansion of Amsterdam's trade in the mid-17th century allowed the city to develop its extant banking system and commodity exchange services to the highest level of volume and sophistication in Europe. In its Exchange, merchants and brokers from all over the world traded goods, currency, rumours - and an unprecedented volume of stocks. Contemporary reports sketch the bustle in the new Exchange building designed by Hendrick de Keyser (1565-1621), the most respected architect and sculptor of his generation. In the seventeenth century the Exchange was extended, the new features of the building were designed by Daniel Stalpaert (1615-1676).The present painting is one of five that Job Berckheyde executed in 1670, just after its expansion in 1668, of the Amsterdam Exchange. It exemplifies the mathematical precision characteristic of his small repertoire of architectural paintings. The last artist to depict the Exchange was Emmanuel de Witte in 1653 whose rendition lacks a vanishing point and correctly aligned orthogonals, in contrast to Berckheyde's meticulous adherence to the rules of perspective

29257-108muril.jpg	Murillo, like Vel�zquez and Ribera, is one of the few Spanish artists with an international reputation. In his own lifetime Murillo's genre scenes were exported to Flanders, but much greater interest was aroused by his work in the early nineteenth century, when, following the Napoleonic invasion of Spain, the agents of French and other collectors were able to acquire and export pictures by him of other types.In this early painting the typical characteristics of the Seville school, by which he was formed, can be observed. There is an accent on clear detail, emphasized by the contrasts of light and shade. The rather high viewpoint creates the impression that one has just walked in on to the scene represented: such effects of intimacy and directness were typical of the aims of Counter-Reformation Baroque

31472-1ceiling.jpg	The picture shows the ceiling painting with mock portico architecture in the Salone on the piano nobile in the Palazzo Spinola Gambaro in Genoa. In the centre panel Domenico Piola's Janus and Hercules in Olympus with Personification of Peace can be seen.For Baroque fresco decorations it was necessary to create 'quadratura' - perspective produced with the aid of a grid of squares - based on architectural principles. Most painters of quadratura, whether for stage sets or in the context of decorative painting, were either architects or specialists in the proper rendering of foreshortened architecture. They were accordingly ill-equipped for the depiction of figures, the very reason for the existence of ceiling pictures. Consequently, they were required to collaborate with figure painters (pittori figuristi), and there were any number of such collaborations in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: Tassi and Domenichino, Tassi and Guercino, Colonna and Albani, Haffner and Canuti, and Mengozzi Colonna and Tiepolo, to name only a few. Teams like these frequently worked together for years.One of the most spectacular ceilings of this type is found in the Palazzo Spinola Gambaro in Genoa, evidence of perfect cooperation between Domenico Piola and the quadratura painter Paolo Brozzi (active 1660s). The dimensions of the room and the ceiling height favoured the resulting harmony between grandiose illusionary architecture in the form of a circling portico and figural additions reflecting the subject matter of the centre panel, an allegory of peace

07174-canal218.jpg	Giovanni Antonio Canal's popularity with English Grand Tourists - mainly young noblemen completing their education with an extended trip to the Continent - has meant that many more of his pictures can be found in Britain than in his native Venice or even throughout Italy. Trained as a scene painter, by 1725 he was specialising in vedute - more or less topographically exact records of the city, its canals and churches, festivals and ceremonies. He visited England several times, but his English paintings did not please, and he returned home for good in about 1756.Although we associate Canaletto for the most part with mass-produced, crystal-clear scenes of celebrated sights, the 'Stonemason's Yard', his masterpiece, is not of this kind. A comparatively early picture, and almost certainly made to order for a Venetian client, it presents an intimate view of the city, as if from a rear window. The site is not in fact a mason's yard, but the Campo San Vidal during re-building operations on the adjoining church of San Vidal or Vitale. Santa Maria della Carit&#224;, now the Accademia di Belle Arti, the main art gallery in Venice, is the church seen across the Grand Canal.The Church of Santa Maria della Carit&#224; is still flanked by the slender campanile that collapsed in 1741.Canaletto's later works are painted rather tightly on a reflective white ground, but this picture was freely brushed over reddish brown, the technical reason for the warm tonality of the whole. Thundery clouds are gradually clearing, and the sun casts powerful shadows, whose steep diagonals help define the space and articulate the architecture. Not doges and dignitaries but the working people and children of Venice animate the scene and set the scale. In the left foreground a mother has propped up her broom to rush to the aid of her fallen and incontinent toddler, watched by a woman airing the bedding out of the window above and a serious little girl. Stonemasons kneel to their work. A woman sits spinning at her window. The city, weatherbeaten, dilapidated, lives on, and below the high bell-tower of Santa Maria della Carit&#224; it is the little shabby house, with a brave red cloth hanging from the window, which catches the brightest of the sunlight

05785-moses.jpg	S�bastien Bourdon represents the classicist and idealizing trend initiated by Nicolas Poussin, his contemporary and the leading French artist of the 17th century. Like Poussin, and like many other French and European artists, Bourdon made the obligatory study trip to Italy - to Rome, where he met Poussin, and to Venice, all of which influenced his style. In Venice he specialized in genre painting and in landscape in imitation of Claude Lorrain. Around 1640 he returned to France, and after some years in the service of Queen Christina of Sweden, he settled in Paris, where he acquired a great reputation. His painting of these French years shows its most obvious debt to Poussin

21147-mountain.jpg	A group of German painters based in Rome in the early nineteenth century had a most decisive effect on the development of German art. The foremost of these artists was Joseph Anton Koch. He was born in Obergiblen in the Tyrol in 1768 but lived in Rome from spring 1795 to his death in 1839. Here he painted the 'heroic landscapes' which form the major part of his work.

16714-lange2da.jpg	Girodet first depicted the actress Mademoiselle Lange as Venus, standing on her couch, her face turned from the viewer (Museum der bildenden K�nste, Leipzig). When the actress expressed her annoyance at the painting, Girodet painted her again, this time in mythological form, Mademoiselle Lange as Dana&#235;.The oval canvas again reveals her lap unclothed, and in light fingers she holds a broken mirror, the symbol of Vanitas. At her feet lies the attribute of Jupiter, a bundle of fire. But Jupiter is not present in the form of the royal eagle, instead we see a turkey-cock. Cupid is looking out of the picture at the viewer and holding up the cloth that covered the actress' lap with an inviting gesture. The painting caused a scandal in the Salon of 1799 and had to be withdrawn. The actress' career was over, and Girodet fell into disfavour.Dana&#235; is frequently represented in Renaissance and Baroque painting.

35938-2bavo4.jpg	Acknowledging the absence of significant Church patronage in the Northern Netherlands, several painters, most innovatively Pieter Saenredam, created a new genre of church painting that celebrates the clean walls of Protestant churches, virtually devoid of decoration. In Calvinist churches the most important piece of furniture was the pulpit, from which preachers read and preached to the congregation. In this painting the pulpit leans against a distant pillar. This church interior belongs to one of the 'neutral' genres of painting that Calvin had authorized for use in decoration and teaching rather than in religious ritual.The prominent organ displays biblical fragments exhorting worshippers to use music and songs to praise God and to teach Christian values. These references contribute, probably deliberately, to the Calvinist debate on organ music in services. While strict theologians considered music too frivolous, most churches continued to use organs

21322-com_saxe.jpg	Maurice, comte de Saxe (Moritz von Sachsen, 1696-1750) was a general and military theorist who successfully led French armies during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48).The illegitimate son of the elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony (later also King Augustus II of Poland), young Maurice was sent by his father to serve under Prince Eugene of Savoy against the French in Flanders in 1709-10. In 1711 he was made Graf von Sachsen (count of Saxony; in French, comte de Saxe). His father bought him a German regiment in the French service in 1719, and Saxe quickly won recognition for his innovations in military training, especially in musketry.Anna Ivanovna, duchess of Courland (later empress of Russia), secured Saxe's election as duke of Courland (a Baltic duchy between Prussia and Latvia) in 1726, but the Russians expelled him from the region in 1727 in order to prevent him from marrying the duchess. Returning to France, Saxe in 1732 wrote Mes R&#234;veries (published in 1756-57), a remarkably original treatise on the science of warfare. He served with distinction in the French army against his own half brother, King August III of Poland, in the War of the Polish Succession (1733-38) and in 1734 was made a lieutenant general.In November 1741, six months after France joined Prussia against Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession, Saxe invaded Bohemia and captured Prague. Although the British had not yet become involved in the conflict, the French king Louis XV in January 1744 made Saxe commander of a force that was to invade Great Britain on behalf of Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, the Stuart claimant to the British throne. The project was dropped after a storm shattered Saxe's invasion fleet at Dunkirk in March. Shortly thereafter, Louis formally declared war on Great Britain and promoted Saxe to the rank of marshal. Saxe and the king then invaded the Austrian Netherlands.The king wisely allowed Saxe to give the orders in the ensuing campaign. Their forces surrounded Tournai, and, when allied troops advanced from the east to relieve the siege, Saxe decisively defeated them in the Battle of Fontenoy (May 11, 1745). It was France's last great victory before the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Saxe then captured Brussels and Antwerp (February 1746). Turning south, he seized Mons and Namur, and on Oct. 11, 1746, he defeated the allies at Raucoux, near Li�ge, thereby completing the conquest of the Austrian Netherlands.In January 1747 Louis appointed Saxe marshal general of France. In 1747 he invaded Holland, defeated an allied army in the Battle of Lauffeld near Maastricht (July 2), and captured the fortress of Bergen-Op-Zoom. Saxe retired to his ch&#226;teau at Chambord, where he died. His grandson was the father of the novelist George Sand

05282-00lastju.jpg	"The central panel of the triptych represents the Last Judgment and the Seven Deadly Sins. The interior view of the left wing depicts the Fall of the Rebel Angels, Creation of Eve, Fall of Man and Expulsion, while the interior view of the right wing shows Hell and the Prince of Darkness.The inclusion of the Fall of Adam and Eve in a representation of the Last Judgment is unusual; the other two panels of the Vienna triptych depart even more from traditional iconography. Generally Heaven was allotted the chief role in the eschatological drama. As in the altarpiece by Roger van der Weyden, it is the act of judgment which is stressed; the judged are relegated to positions of secondary importance, and the felicity of the saved is described as fully as the pains of the lost. In Bosch's version, however, the divine court appears small and insignificant at the top of the central panel, and very few souls are numbered among the elect. The majority of mankind has been engulfed in the universal cataclysm which rages throughout the deep, murky landscape below.This vast panoramic nightmare represents the earth in her final death throes, destroyed not by water as D�rer and Leonardo were to envision it, but by the fire foretold in a thirteenth-century hymn, the sombre Dies Irae: ""Day of Wrath, that day when the world dissolves in glowing ashes"". Bosch was probably also influenced by the account of the last days given in the Revelation of St John, a book which enjoyed renewed popularity in the late fifteenth century, when it was illustrated by D�rer in his famous Apocalypse woodcuts of 1497-98. The wide valley dominating the central panel may represent the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which, on the basis of several Old Testament references (Joel 4:2,12), was traditionally thought to be the site of the Last Judgment, with the walls of the earthly Jerusalem blazing in the background. In any event, earth has become indistinguishable from Hell, depicted on the right wing, out of which the army of Satan swarms to attack the damned; the eternity of torment has begun.The Hell scene in the Prado Tabletop had paired off each punishment with one of the Deadly Sins. In the Last Judgment it would be difficult to identify the punishments with specific sins. The avaricious are boiled in the great cauldron just visible beneath one of the buildings in the central panel. Around the corner, a fat glutton is forced to drink from a barrel held by two devils; the source of his dubious refreshment can be seen squatting in the window overhead. The lascivious woman on the roof above suffers the attentions of a lizard-like monster slithering across her loins, while being serenaded by two musical demons. On the cliffs to the right, across the river, blacksmith-devils hammer other victims on anvils, and one is being shod like a horse; these unfortunate souls are guilty of the sin of anger"

11950-orsett01.jpg	The Palazzo Orsetti Dolfin Giacomelli (named after the successive owner families) looks out over the Sile River. Inside, the architect designed a spacious, double-height ballroom on the piano nobile, with an open balcony circling the entire perimeter. This hall was frescoed by Louis Dorigny in c. 1710.The fresco decoration appears on the ceiling, in three compartments with ornate frames that are elegantly interwoven with luxuriant, gilded oak branches. The elongated central compartment contains the Bacchanal, a rustic and lively scene, in which, against a sky with scattered pearly clouds, and delineated in a daring foreshortened view, delicate figures are engaged in a frenetic orgy on the edge of the abyss. In the compartment toward the window overlooking the street, Pan appears with the Hours, while in the compartment on the other side, toward the garden, Pan Uncovering the Nakedness of a Sleeping Nymph is represented.On the walls above the balcony windows, inside six elaborate faux-stucco cartouches, the artist has painted lively scenes of putti at play

The artist ""is obligated to apply himself to this painting so that the said picture will excel, or at least favourably compare with, every good picture made thus far by [him]."" The appearance of the central section is carefully prescribed: the Virgin is to be flanked by John the Baptist and five other named saints ""with all the usual attributes."" Gozzoli must also ""with his own hand...paint at the bottom, that is in the predella...the stories of said saints.""This is one of those predella panels. And here Gozzoli had the freedom to exercise his particular skill as a storyteller. In this one small painting he has packed three episodes related in Matthew 14:6-8. At the centre of the painting, we see the twirling figure of Salome, dancing to entertain Herod and his guests, all of whom wear fifteenth-century finery. Herod was so enchanted that he promised Salome whatever she might ask, and prompted by her mother, who sought revenge against John, Salome's request was bloody: ""Give me the head of John the Baptist."" There inside an archway at left, the saint kneels to be beheaded. And at the rear Salome presents the severed head to her mother."

32262-14temple.jpg	In the last part of the 1630s Poussin's art underwent a rapid metamorphosis. One of the best examples of this is the Destruction of the Temple at Jerusalem. It is dry in handling and agitated in composition, and has that peculiar unattractiveness of surface on which Poussin was to dwell so much in his later years. His denial of the sensual quality of painting was deliberate: this preoccupation with surface texture is found in all his pictures of around 1630. Yet the Vienna picture succeeds by the mood it creates. The subject is one of prime importance for Jewish as well as Christian history - the final and irrevocable loss of the Jews' holiest place - and Poussin has concentrated on the mood of wanton destruction.This is the second version of  The Destruction of the Temple by Poussin, the first version has come down to us only in an engraving. Here the individual scenes are framed between the regular succession of huge columns. It is evident that the artist has already begun to study Rome's ancient monuments, as a comparison with antique sculptures such as the Trophies of Marius reveals

28786-stephen.jpg	"Luis de Morales (called El Divino) was a distinctly original personality. The distinctive features of his style - a painstaking technique inherited from the Flemish masters, and elongated forms that foreshadow the art of El Greco - are especially evident in the works of his final period. Morales painted numerous versions of the Virgin and Child, sometimes with the infant St John, and touching visions inspired by the theme ""Ecce Homo"", which are among his most popular works. Sensitivity to content and concentration on the sacred drama are the chief characteristics of this typical representative of Spanish asceticism"

12585-8jerome.jpg	D�rer painted St Jerome in Antwerp in March 1521 and presented the panel to his friend Rodrigo Fernandez d'Almada. He wrote in his diary: `I painted a Jerome carefully in oils and gave it to Rodrigo of Portugal.' The panel was displayed in the merchant's private chapel in Antwerp and was later taken back to Portugal. It is the only religious picture that D�rer painted in the Netherlands.The figure of the saint is based on a drawing of an old bearded man. On the drawing, D�rer inscribed: `The man was 93 years old and yet healthy and strong in Antwerp.' The skull in the painting, which D�rer had also sketched separately (Graphische Sammlung Albertina, Vienna), was probably the `little skull' which he had recorded buying for two pennies several months earlier in Cologne.In the painting, St Jerome, bearing the wrinkled features of the 93 year-old, rests his right hand against his head, in a contemplative pose. With his index finger of the other hand he lightly touches the skull, a symbol of the brevity of life. The skull is symbolically placed between the open Bible on a small lectern and the ink-well, a reminder of the saint's role as the translator of the Bible. The aged St Jerome looks despondently out of the picture. D�rer's painting was strongly influenced by Flemish art, particularly the work of Quentin Massys.There is an inscription on the slip of paper sticking out of the book, monogrammed and dated 1521

20959-insects3.jpg	Jan van Kessel's intimate cabinet paintings, which manage to combine an intense observation of natural history with an attractive design, have always been among the most prized of his works. He started painting them in the first half of the 1650s, and continued painting these subjects well into the 1660s. The majority of them were painted on copper, the smooth surface of which was better suited to his meticulous and detailed finish. Many are purely studies of insects, but these are sometimes, as here, combined with studies of flowers or branches of fruit, and occasionally shells.These tiny coppers most probably originally formed part of a series of plates for a small cabinet, in which a collector would have kept his natural specimens as well as other curiosities in small drawers
