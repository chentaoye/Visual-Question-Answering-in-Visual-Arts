19873-1darmst.jpg	The Meyer or Darmstadt Madonna is the last, most famous and most effective of Holbein's great religious works, above all in its depiction of individual human identities combined with spectacular spatial control and illusionism - as exemplified by the ruckled carpet.Standing in a scalloped niche with projecting consoles, Mary, with the Christ Child in her arms, is surrounded by the Meyer family. The hooped crown, an allusion to the German imperial crown, identifies her as the Queen of Heaven. Typologically, the painting is a Schutzmantelbild (a `Virgin of Pity' painting), in which the donor, Jakob Meyer, invokes and gains divine protection for himself and his family. Unusually, the donor is shown as the same size as the Virgin.Chastened by worldly failure and disgrace, Meyer no longer staunchly outstares the world but has his eyes fixed on other realms in meditative intensity. This introspection is echoed by his wives the enigmatic enwrapped profile of his first, Magdalena Baer (who had died in 1511) and Dorothea Kannengiesser. Before them kneels Anna, the only surviving child, whose portrait drawing in chalk shows her with free-flowing hair. Holbein repainted her hair tied in a band after her engagement.In front of Jakob, in a Raphaelesque triangular pose deployed with subtlety and skill, his two deceased sons are depicted. The baby, with curly blonde hair and pudgy cheeks, has affinities with the Leonardo type. Also Leonardesque is the prowess shown in the foreshortening of the Christ-child's extended arm, and the naturalness of the baby's pose, which recall The Virgin of the Rocks

18759-guard301.jpg	Whereas Canaletto incorporates classically inspired structures or ruins into his fantastic views, and accords them an important place in the composition, Francesco Guardi's capriccios mostly refer to his own immediate surroundings: the Venetian Lagoon. In this poetic scene decorative fishing boats with yellow and brown sails are illustrated, lying in still, light-green water. Similar little ships also figure prominently in a number of Guardi's town views. In the foreground fishermen are seated together in an improvised tent, while elsewhere men are busy moving freight. The composition is constructed clearly, by means of coulisses which harmonize with the nuances in the palette. The thickly painted foreground consists of a sand bar and a hillock, behind which the fishing tent is located. The middle distance is formed by a spit of land with the remains of a wall on it in subdued, brown tones, and a large ornamental vase on a pedestal, a motif that Guardi may have borrowed from Marco Ricci. Directly behind this rises the wispy silhouette of the city, which stands out against the low sunlight. The various levels are connected to one another by the transparently painted water, which merges with the sky almost imperceptibly at the horizon.The theme of the walled city on the water is reminiscent of the capriccios Luca Carlevaris and Marco Ricci painted some fifty or sixty years earlier under the influence of seventeenth-century Roman examples. Guardi gave this view an unmistakably Venetian streak, however, by means of the Lagoon-like atmosphere and the striking belltowers, walls and roofs, which seem to be borrowed literally from the Venetian townscape

00930-30coron.jpg	Fra Angelico dedicated several of his works to the scene of Mary's coronation (Louvre, Paris; Museo di San Marco, Florence, Uffizi, Florence). In these pictures the ceremoniousness of the event is lessened by the gentle charm of the details.This painting is from the church of Sant'Egidio of Ospedale di Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. Its approach is special in that it presents the scene in the sky, floating on clouds, thus placing Jesus and Mary and their surrounding entourage in an interesting perspective. Spatial relations are illustrated by the use of size differences, the virtuoso rendering of light-rays, and colour perspective.The angelic choir greets the Queen of Heavens with song and dance. In the right foreground, with his back to the viewer, an angel dressed in blue plays the portative organ; his companion to the left a stringed instrument. Above, on both sides of the main group, the trumpets are raised high above the heads. Among the other instruments we can recognize a beautiful lute on the left, and a small oval-shaped violin (or mandola) on the right. The inner ring is composed of six tall, dancing angels; their flowing robes and the position of their hands indicate the direction of their movement

24485-01view.jpg	The Bardi di Vernio Chapel in Santa Croce is one of the ten that were built at the same time as the transept between 1295 and 1310. It is located in the northern arm of the transept. The chapel was frescoed c. 1335 by Maso di Banco, one of Giotto's pupils and followers. Patronage of this chapel was not transferred to the Bardi di Vernio until 1602. In the fourteenth century it was the Bardi di Mangona, a branch of the family named after the Castello di Mangona near Florence, who were its patrons.In the upper part of the left (north) wall the St Sylvester cycle of Maso di Banco can be found. The two tomb monuments are unusually elaborated for family chapels of this period. The larger of the two, whose sarcophagus and marble baldachin were later added to the niche decorated by Maso, was for the male member of the family, the smaller one (the arcosolium, an arched recess used as a place of entombment) for the female members. Maso painted only the front wall of the latter, the interior of the niche is attributed to Taddeo Gaddi.On the fresco a male member of the Bardi family kneels on his sarcophagus, quite alone on the desolate plain of the afterlife. His sarcophagus is decorated with marble reliefs of the Man of Sorrows and the Bardi arms, while the image of Christ as a judge, displaying his wounds and surrounded by angels is painted in fresco on the wall above

21949-4lastsu3.jpg	"Leonardo's painting of the Last Supper was constructed symmetrically according to the laws of central perspective, with a main figure, Jesus, in the centre. He is physically and psychologically isolated from the other figures and with his hands is pointing to the bread and wine, making the introduction of the Eucharist the central event. In Leonardo's conception, the other figures are reacting directly to Jesus, and at the same time, some of them are coming into contact with each other.James the Great, whose mouth is opened in astonishment, is sitting on the right next to Jesus, and spreading out his arms as if trying to say to the two disciples behind him, who are attempting to command the attention of Jesus with their eloquent gestures and the way they are pushing forward, that they should be quiet and listen.James the Less, the second from the left, places his hand on Peter's back, while Andrew next to him is still holding his hands before him and speaking, but his eyes are already seeking out Jesus. Peter and John are facing each other deep in conversation, just like the group of three on the far right who still seem to be animatedly discussing the previous announcement of the existence of a traitor.That this announcement has indeed already taken place is proven by the behaviour of John and Peter. In contrast with the usual manner of depiction, in which John is lying against Christ's chest, here Leonardo refers to the Gospel of St John (13:24): ""Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.""By combining these two apostles into a group with Judas in this manner, Leonardo was distancing himself from the traditional scheme of depiction used for Last Suppers, according to which Peter and John sat to the right and left of Jesus. In contrast to the other apostles, however, he characterized them so clearly that they are identifiable to the observer. He identified Peter by means of the threatening dagger that he would, at dawn, use to cut off the ear of Malchus, one of the soldiers arresting Jesus.John, the favourite disciple, is wearing red and blue garments as is Jesus, and is seated at his right hand, the most honourable place. But Judas above all was clearly characterized by Leonardo, for he was not, as was customary, placed in the centre of the picture in front of the table, but placed amongst the row of disciples. He is identified by means of several motifs such as his reaching for the bread, the purse containing the reward for his treachery and the knocking over of a saltcellar, a sign of misfortune. Leonardo even formally expressed his isolation from the group by depicting him as the only one whose upper body is leaning against the table, shrinking back from Jesus"

08705-pieta.jpg	The figures, which might have been taken from Gothic sculpture, are placed before a chased golden background. To the left of the middle distance is the view of a small town with spires, to the right austere mountains. The suffering figure of the Virgin dominates the painting. No longer young, her pallid face is immobile in its grief. Her blue mantle covers her head, revealing a white veil, and spreads out in huge folds to her feet. In a strange pose, the back arched, the body rigid, Christ, a white cloth wrapped across his loins, appears to be floating on her lap. A young St John bends in loving tenderness above him, with the kneeling donor beside St John. On the right the mourning, pitiful figure of St Mary Magdalen completes the diagonal line arching over the Virgin and St John to the donor. The yellow-lined red cloak of the Magdalen extends around her in a great curve. Her left hand holds the vase of ointment, with the right she presses the edge of her cloak to her eye.Its concentrated emotion, dramatic force and religious content make this painting the supreme manifestation in mediaeval art of the tragedy of Christ, only softened by the tender expression on St John's face. The Virgin's sorrow is profound and austere, almost unbending; the Magdalen's is softer, more womanly. This masterpiece has been claimed for many schools, including the Catalan and Portuguese, but it seems almost certain that the painter was the French Charonton. With this work the master enriched French and European painting with one of the finest representations of the Piet&#224; in existence

20109-44hooch.jpg	Pieter de Hooch depicts for us incidents in the daily lives of women at home with their children: the mother watching over the cradle, serving her family at table, reading a letter or working in her kitchen. Some of his paintings show guests arriving in a spotlessly clean room or courtyard, taking a glass of wine, listening to music or conversing together. The keynote of every single picture is an intimate simplicity; the painter conducts us into a calm and quiet world, both clean and orderly, inhabited by the well-to-do. Patrons, whose preference was for something livelier, for gay and colourful peasant scenes, bought pictures by the Ostades, Jan Steen or Jan Miense Molenaer, but de Hooch was popular in the narrower circle of those who appreciated his distinctive approach and delicacy of execution. The magic of his works lies not so much in his subjects as in the means by which he interpreted them: the lucid and balanced composition, the feeling of space and the warm glow of his colours.The sunlight streaming through the window suggests early afternoon. Reflected light and soft shadows are intermingled on the oriental rug spread over the table, the leather-backed chairs, the curtain and the lead-framed window-panes. It seems as if the quiet would be hardly broken by any sounds from far or near. The act of reading by the young woman sitting in a corner of the room is just as objectively portrayed. The atmosphere of intimacy is absolute, emanating alike from the lady and the objects included in the composition

14896-ulysses.jpg	The subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Knowing her son was destined to die if he went to fight in the Trojan war, Thethis, a sea nymph, disguised Achilles as a woman and entrusted him to King Lycomedes, in whose palace on the isle of Scyros he lived among the king's daughters. Odysseus and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch Achilles. They cunningly laid a heap of gifts before the girls - jewellery, clothes and other finery, but among them a sword, spear and shield. When a trumpet was sounded, Achilles instinctively snatched up the weapons and thus betrayed his identity.Doric columns and a peristyle create perspective in Gauffrier's painting and dramatically emphasise the contrast of light and shade in the picture

00853-39_ador.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 39 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.One cell at the end of the corridor for lay brothers was distinguished by its occupant and size. It was intended for Cosimo de' Medici, who belonged to the community by virtue of his patronage. His room, in fact, was a double cell (Cells 38 and 39), in which the superimposed chambers were joined by a short flight of stairs. Of all the cells along this corridor, Cosimo's was the most spacious and elaborately decorated. On the entrance wall of the lower room (Cell 38) Fra Angelico painted the crucified Christ against a ground of costly lapis lazuli, rather than the bare plaster background found in the other cells. The inscribed haloes identify the saints kneeling alongside the Virgin as Cosmas, Peter martyr and John the Evangelist, protectors of Cosimo, his oldest son, and his father, Giovanni di Bicci.The Adoration of the Magi and the image of Christ as Man of Sorrows in the recessed tabernacle below met Cosimo's gaze once he ascended the stairs to Cell 39. Benozzo Gozzoli, whose style closely resembled that of Angelico, and an assistant painted these frescoes, as shown by the slightly awkward stance and proportions of some of the figures as well as by their linear, closely spaced facial features

07480-13fligh.jpg	"The story of the Holy Family's flight was one of the most popular apocryphal legends which survived the prohibitive decrees of the Council of Trent and often appeared in painting from the end of the sixteenth century. Caravaggio's idyllic painting is an individualistic representation of this.The artist ingeniously uses the figure of an angel playing the violin with his back to the viewer to divide the composition into two parts. On the right, before an autumnal river-front scene, we can see the sleeping Mary with a dozing infant in her left; on the left, a seated Joseph holding the musical score for the angel. The natural surroundings reminds the viewer of the Giorgionesque landscapes of the Cinquecento masters of Northern Italian painting, and it is fully imbued with a degree of nostalgia. Contrasting the unlikelihood of the event is the realistic effect of depiction, the accuracy of details, the trees, the leaves and stones, whereby the total impression becomes astonishingly authentic. The statue-like figure of the angel, with a white robe draped around him, is like a charmingly shaped musical motif, and it provides the basic tone for the composition. It is an interesting contradiction - and at the same time a good example for the adaptability of forms - that this figure of pure classical beauty is a direct descendant of Annibale Carracci's Luxuria from the painting ""The Choice of Heracles"".It has not been clearly decided what was the textual source for the music-playing angel in the story of the flight into Egypt. Charming is Caravaggio's decision to actively involve St Joseph in the music-making."

32820-37entom.jpg	Among the figurative components which Raphael drew from his Florentine experience, those which derive from Michelangelo seem most prevalent in his last Florentine works. The work in which Michelangelo's importance to Raphael becomes most evident is the Deposition (Entombment). The panel was painted in 1507 in Perugia for Atalanta Baglioni as a votive offering in memory of her son, Grifonetto, killed in a piazza in Perugia in the course of a family feud.The artist detaches himself both formally and iconographically from traditional representations of the scene. He does not depict the deposition itself, but the carrying of the dead Christ. The protagonists of the scene do not demonstrate their sorrow violently, but are reduced, through the Raphaelesque mode of feeling, to a sort of painful resignation. The vision of space is less geometric than the Florentine vision, and it appears freer and closer to nature. The influence of Michelangelo is strong, however, and can be perceived without doubt in the limp arm of Christ as well as in the female figure at the extreme right. The latter mirrors the figure of the Virgin in the Tondo Doni, which Michelangelo executed between 1504 and 1506. The formal vigour and sense of open space which characterize Michelangelo's painting certainly must have had a profound effect on Raphael.There are three compositions (Faith, Hope and Charity) of the predella executed in a delicate monochrome (today in the Vatican Museum). Both the main panel and the predella were carried from Perugia to Rome by Pope Paul V. They were replaced by copies in 1608. The painting was subsequently included among the works taken by the French troops and was exhibited in Paris in the Napoleonic Museum from 1797 to 1815 when, following the restitutions ordered by the Congress of Vienna, it was returned to Rome

31428-04homag.jpg	There is a distinct break in the narrative before the fourth scene. In 1445 Piccolomini suffered a major spiritual crisis, and he turned away from his secular way of life. He became interested in effecting some kind of compromise between the emperor and the pope. Frederick III sent him to the papal court to urge Eugenius IV to convene a new council, and Piccolomini took that opportunity to beg the pope to forgive him for having strayed from the faith. The pope is seated on an elevated throne, flanked by cardinals. Enea Silvio, dressed in a splendid gold robe, has thrown himself at his feet.

In both paintings, the way the silvery daylight flows over the figures set against light walls is not surpassed by Vermeer. The pendants offer a small drama: the handsome man writes a letter, and its patient recipient attentively reads it by the light of a window. Here letter writing and reading are most likely associated with love. The Man Writing a Letter offers a view of the love of comfort and beautiful materials in the home of a well-to-do burgher about 1660, and the heavily carved gilt Baroque frame around the landscape painting on the wall behind the handsome young man makes clear that not all seventeenth-century Dutch pictures were enclosed in rectilinear black ebony mouldings

39395-3flight.jpg	As so often with Tintoretto, this painting is matched with the utmost exactitude to its situation on the ground floor Sala Inferiore of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco: in the arching branch on the left, the curve of the palm fronds on the right, and the roughly circular view of the sky at the centre, the painter echoes the shape of the windows flanking the picture with astonishing precision. Like the needy people who waited for charitable donations on the bench below the painting, the Holy Family seems to be fleeing hopefully out of the picture and into the Sala Inferiore of the Confraternity of St Roch itself.In the wooded hollow, after furtively avoiding every inhabited place, Mary and Joseph together with the Holy Child, prepare to take a rest. On the left, in the foreground, in the web of dull greens, browns and whites of the landscape, the group of fugitives and their humble packs are depicted with concise reality in every element of form and colour. On the right the landscape scene, built up with extraordinary, quick brush-strokes and enlarged into fathomless depths, opens out.Tintoretto's sensitivity to simple and popular forms of religious practice, with subdued yet mystical overtones, here produce an intensely poetic effect. The trees, water, living creatures, and clouds all seem caressed by a glimmering light that gives them an unearthly intensity

23352-13goldsm.jpg	The representation of the sitter from three different viewpoints makes this portrait highly unusual within Lotto's own work and within Italian Renaissance portraiture generally. The identity of the sitter is not known, nor is it clear why he is presented in three different views.According to one theory, the box placed prominently at the lower edge of the picture is a game of lottery, popular in the sixteenth century, and it was introduced by the painter as a play on his name, and hence the picture should be seen as a self-portrait. However, later it was realized that the foreground object is not a gambling game, but a case of rings, making it clear that the sitter was not the painter but a goldsmith. It is documented that Lotto had a particular interest  in goldsmith work and jewelry and he had several goldsmiths among his closest friends

29855-haneton1.jpg	The centre of the triptych offers Christ's entombment to our contemplation. The Virgin, St John, Mary Magdalene and the two Maries surround the corpse a few moments before its burial. Tears stream down their faces like translucent pearls and the brownish shadows underline their painful expressions. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus appear in the rear, awkwardly linked to the group by the presence of the crown of thorns reminding us that it is they who took Christ down from the cross.Van Orley has removed the scene from its historical context, taking out any narrative element, other than a corner of the stone tomb visible to the bottom right, and focusing attention on the persons pressed one against another against the gilded background. This converts the entombment into an act of devotion, continuing the tradition of the Flemish Primitives. On the other hand, the fluid shapes, the monumental nature of the figures and certain attitudes point to the influence of D�rer and of Italian artists. Van Orley, who was also a well-known decorator and designer of tapestries and stained glass windows, repeats the same composition, with the addition of a landscape background and the tomb, in a tapestry conserved at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.Ancient literary sources tell us that the work was commissioned from Van Orley by Philippe Haneton around 1520, to be placed above the family tomb in the church of St Gudule in Brussels. The donor held high political office, having been appointed first secretary of the Grand Council by Charles V in 1518, and tasked with judging petitions for audiences with the emperor. He was also the treasurer of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He is shown on the left wing, surrounded by his seven sons. The donor's wife, Marguerite Numan, accompanied by her five daughters, is shown on the right wing, under the protection of Margaret of Antioch.When closed the triptych shows the Annunciation painted in grisaille

03902-183madon.jpg	"Bellini's last phase is heralded with the Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints Peter, Catherine, Lucia and Jerome of the church of San Zaccaria in Venice, dated 1505. According to Ridolfi (1648) the altarpiece, commissioned in memory of Pietro Cappello, was already in its own time ""considered one of the most beautiful and refined works of the master"". Bellini was now an old man of about seventy-five. Yet his astounding ability to change, arising from a conscious understanding of the evolution of art, does not appear to have dimmed for a moment. Confronted by the first achievements of Giorgione, he assimilated and adapted them to his own artistic expressivity with total coherence. The compositional and architectural structure of the canvas is not fundamentally very different from the San Giobbe Altarpiece: a niche-like apse surrounding the group of the enthroned Madonna and the saints who are positioned at her sides. Here too, from a spatial point of view, the painting becomes a continuation of the altar on which it is placed. But at the same time the landscape appearing from the sides, according to an idea taken from Alvise Vivarini who had experimented it in the Battuti Altarpiece at Belluno (now destroyed), pour forth into the air a light that softens the forms. The tonal colour gains the upper hand, creating a new harmony of broad planes, softened forms, and a warm sense of the air. In his turn Giorgione must have contemplated this elaboration the old Bellini was making of his inventions, and kept it in mind in the frescoes of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi of some years later.When one enters the little church of San Zaccaria in Venice and stands before the picture, immediately notices that his approach to colour was very different. Not that the picture is particularly bright or shining. It is rather the mellowness and richness of the colours that impress one before one even begins to look at what the picture represents. Even the photograph conveys something of the warm and gilded atmosphere which fills the niche in which the Virgin sits enthroned, with the infant Jesus lifting His little hands to bless the worshippers before the altar. An angel at the foot of the altar softly plays the violin, while the saints stand quietly at either side of the throne: St Peter with his key and book, St Catherine with the palm of martyrdom and the broken wheel, St Lucy and St Jerome, the scholar who translated the Bible into Latin, and whom Bellini therefore represented as reading a book.Many Madonnas with saints have been painted before and after, in Italy and elsewhere, but few were ever conceived with such dignity and repose. In the Byzantine tradition, the picture of the Virgin used to be rigidly flanked by images of the saints, Bellini knew how to bring life into this simple symmetrical arrangement without upsetting its order. He also knew how to turn the traditional figures of the Virgin and saints into real and living beings without divesting them of their holy character and dignity. He did not even sacrifice the variety and individuality of real life - as Perugino had done to some extent. St Catherine with her dreamy smile, and St Jerome, the old scholar engrossed in his book, are real enough in their own ways, although they, too, no less than Perugino's figures, seem to belong to another more serene and beautiful world, a world transfused with that warm and supernatural light that fills the picture.

One possibility is that the triptych is a traditional family epitaph or memorial tablet showing a family portrait of an older couple with their five sons and two daughters.This work integrates temporal and eternal realms by combining the genres  of the secular family portrait and the devotional image. Highly unusual is the intimate, shoulder-to-shoulder proximity of the sitters to Christ and the complete absence of prayer gestures.No satisfactory attribution has been offered for the triptych.

07779-80martyr.jpg	"Canvas No. 8 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".The speed at which Carpaccio's ideas develop is noticeable in the Martyrdom of the Pilgrims and the Funeral of St Ursula, signed and dated 1493 on the scroll at the foot of the column bearing two coats-of-arms, the emblem of the Loredan family and another one, probably belonging to the Caotorta family.The composition of the scene is quite complex, for Carpaccio wanted to include two separate episodes from the legend of St Ursula in the same painting, one being the violent scene of the slaughter of the pilgrims and the other the sad and mournful description of the saint's funeral: he succeeds thanks to his masterly spatial division of the composition. The focus of the painting is the knight about to draw his sword out of its scabbard; notice how similar he is to certain figures by Perugino. Behind him, the moorish bugler on horseback rallies the troops and the white and red standard gives depth to the background landscape, mellowed by the green meadow and the pinkish buildings depicted in the peaceful light of the Venetian pre-Alps.Right in the foreground, on the edge of the field in which the knights look almost as though they were taking part in a mediaeval tournament, a fair-haired archer draws the bow he holds in his gloved hand - he is like a sophisticated arabesque in his elegant pose and splendid costume. Motionless, Ursula awaits the mortal arrow, standing against a background of trees, arranged like the wings of a stage, that seem to prolong the scene of the slaughter all the way to infinity. But, just like the fresco of this same episode painted by Tommaso da Modena more than a century earlier, every gesture, even the most violent, is part of a deliberate rhythm and a strict geometric pattern composed of the interplay of weapons of all sorts: swords, daggers, misericords, bludgeons, pikes, spears and halberds, each carefully described down to the tiniest details.The calculated violence of the scene of the slaughter is separated from the solemnly dignified scene of Ursula's funeral by a column on a pedestal of a very complex shape and colour scheme. This second event is indissolubly linked to the first since they are both set in the unmistakable atmosphere of the Venetian mainland landscape. The funeral procession solemnly parades out of the town at the foot of the wooded hill, and marches towards the mausoleum; all that we can see of the mausoleum is one marble corner, in the shadow, with a carved inscription reading URSULA. Against the vibrant luminosity of the blue sky, the landscape, the human beings and the architectural constructions appear almost like a colourful inlay. All the characters, portraits of contemporaries, take part in this splendid interplay of forms, with their statuary solidity and their sense of physical movement; notice particularly the woman kneeling to the right, presumably a deceased member of the Caotorta family since she is portrayed set apart from the rest of the procession"

21143-viewlake.jpg	K&#248;bke's journey abroad in 1839 seems to have been the decisive influence on him. During this trip, he came into contact with German Romanticism in Dresden and with the landscape tradition of Rome, his principal destination. When he returned to Copenhagen, he made a series  of remarkable studies of the city - particularly the areas around the Frederiksborg Castle - that display both a fidelity to observation and a delight in depicting people and places from striking and revealing viewpoints. His View of One of the Lakes in Copenhagen is the best known of these works.The painting shows two figures on the edge of a jetty watching a departing boat.

07593-55flagel.jpg	This major painting, which (like the Seven Works of Mercy) dates from Caravaggio's first visit to Naples, is disquieting in its own special way. In May 1607 he was paid by Tommaso de' Franchis for an altarpiece to hang in the family chapel in San Domenico, where it stayed till 1972.The atmosphere is so dense that the pillar before which Christ is being whipped can hardly be made out, but the handling of paint is so fluent that the cruel action taking place has its own powerful rhythm. The viewer is caught up in the horror.The near-naked Christ is being twisted into position by the torturer on the right while the torturer on the left tears at his hair. At the bottom left a third tormentor stoops to prepare his scourge.The composition is derived from a mural painting by Sebastiano del Piombo, but its restricted palette of dismal colours gives it a grim force that few earlier paintings had equaled

The farmer has climbed up a ladder to inspect a dovecote.

22263-y_flute.jpg	Leyster's teacher is undocumented. Although she was one of Frans Hals's most gifted followers, there is no documentary evidence that she was apprenticed to him, but visual evidence suggests she may have worked with him for a time in some capacity. She learned as much from Dirk Hals as from Frans Hals's motifs and style.All known evidence indicates that Leyster virtually stopped working as a professional painter after her marriage to Miense Molenaer in 1636. The loss to Dutch art caused by her abandonment of painting when she was in her late twenties is keenly felt when we confront her Young Flute Player of about 1635, which shows her at her best. The brushwork here has become personal, and the subtle gradations in value on the light-grey wall and the colouristic harmony of the boy's red hat, olive-green jacket, violet trousers, and mottled green chair make an exquisite effect.When looking at this little masterwork it is difficult to understand how Leyster's name could have been forgotten for more than two centuries after it was painted.

15941-threephi.jpg	The Three Philosophers must be a work of the last couple of years of Giorgione's life, since a near-contemporary source says that it was begun by him and finished by Sebastiano del Piombo, a collaboration confirmed by stylistic analysis. The subject matter has long been a source of disagreement. In addition to interpret the painting as three philosophers (or three matematicians) it is also assumed that the painting represents the three Magi, the Holy Family being in the cave at the left.Whatever the precise theme, one can find three ages of man, three distinct temperaments, and three different nations. There are important pentimenti, more easily accomplished in the oil medium that Giorgione favoured than with tempera. The present picture may have been cut down on all sides, judging from a later copy. If there was an element of collaboration, the invention and the figure types, their poses, and the relation of one to another are Giorgione's. Sebastiano's role must have been limited literally to finishing the work, that is, giving it the final surface and unifying the elements. In the Three Philosophers the figures are rather weightless, silent images, placed somewhat unspecifically in space, haphazardly related, as it were, to the landscape. For example, the youngest figure, seated toward the centre of the composition, is partly blocked out by the oriental with the deep red garment, and his head, in profile, is apparently unrelated to the twin tree trunks behind it. The natural and private world Giorgione has created envelops us with its mystery and poetry, with its antiscientific structure and even its rather unclassical choice of figural types and poses.The painting belonged to the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels, as shown by the painting of David Teniers (now in the Prado, Madrid). Teniers also painted a strongly modified copy of this painting (now in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin)

00872-1scenes.jpg	This view shows the window (west) and entry (north) walls of the chapel decorated by Fra Angelico. The fresco cycle consists of scenes from the lives of the archdeacons Stephen (lunette) and Lawrence (bottom register).On either side of the scenes on the west (and similarly on the east) wall there is a narrow panel containing only a single figure. These panels are actually on the inner face of the arches at the end of these walls. There eight full-length figures of saints painted on the arches. (In this view St Ambrose and, below him, St Thomas Aquinas is shown.) The chapel's wainscoting section, roughly 2,5 meters high, is painted with a wall drapery in a pomegranate design against a red background. In two spots the coat-of-arms of Pope Nicholas V appears inside a laurel wreath. The deep embrasures of the two windows present six- and seven-lobed rosettes containing alternating floral designs and portrait busts prophets and saints.

37307-foglian2.jpg	"The fresco of Guidoriccio da Fogliano, depicting the conquest of the castles of Montemassi and Sassoforte in 1328, formed part of a fresco cycle ""Castelli"" which occupied the upper part of the wall opposite to the Maest&#224; in the Sala del Mappamondo. The cycle, commemorating the castles conquered by the Sienese, was initiated in 1314 by the representation of the Castle of Giuncarico, it was continued by the Guidoriccio and in 1331 by the Castles of Arcidosso and Piano. The latter were destroyed in 1361 when Lippo Vanni painted the Battles of Valdichiana and Poggio Imperiale. In the 1970s, the famous fresco, which had always been, considered the greatest example of Martini's artistic excellence, was re-attributed to a much later artist. The controversy that followed this re-attribution, further stimulated by the discovery of a fresco below the Guidoriccio (a very beautiful one, and certainly much older as we can see from the overlapping of the intonaco), turned into an animated diatribe that has not yet been placated"

23813-5dejeun1.jpg	The outcry provoked by this painting was greater than anything previously provoked by Courbet. Manet was surely echoing Courbet's Young Ladies by the River Seine in presenting his prostitute with two dandies. The rowboat in the background and the fine still-life of discarded garments and picnic things both refer to Courbet's painting. However, Manet was careful to pay tribute to the art of the past: the idea of combining nude and dressed figures he borrowed from Giorgione's (or probably Titian's) Pastoral Concert, and the poses are in part taken from an engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi based on the Judgment of Paris by Raphael.Manet had friends sit for him in modern dress, and the seated nude is Victorine Meurent, a favourite model of his for the past year

09586-duomo.jpg	Born in Correggio, a small town equidistant between Mantua and Parma in northern Italy from which he takes his name, Antonio Allegri is now perhaps the least familiar of the great painters of the Italian Renaissance. His most important works - innovative vault and dome frescoes and many altarpieces - remain in Parma, the native city of his follower, Parmigianino. Only a relatively small number of other religious images, two allegorical pictures, and the artist's six erotic paintings on mythological themes - including 'The School of Love' - for Federigo II Gonzaga, Lord of Mantua, have entered major European museums. Had a painter as accomplished and influential as Correggio been employed in a more self-conscious and self- publicising artistic centre, such as Florence or Rome, he would surely have been better documented in his lifetime. Were Parma still on the tourist trail, as it was in the more leisurely century of Grand Tourism, he might be better known today. Few of the millions of visitors to Rome now realise, for example, that the great Baroque dome and vault decorations of the city's churches, flooded with heavenly light and dizzying crowds of saints and angels, emulate Correggio's frescoes of a hundred years earlier, through the agency of Lanfranco, a painter from Parma. Equally, the playful sensuality of eighteenth-century Rococo art owes much to Correggio's easel paintings in French royal collections.The fresco of the Assumption of the Virgin in the dome of the cathedral of Parma marks the culmination of Correggio's career as a mural painter. This fresco (a painting in plaster with water-soluble pigments) anticipates the Baroque style of dramatically illusionistic ceiling painting. The entire architectural surface is treated as a single pictorial unit of vast proportions, equating the dome of the church with the vault of heaven. The realistic way the figures in the clouds seem to protrude into the spectators' space is an audacious and astounding use for the time of foreshortening

It characteristically took the form of a series of panel paintings, usually three in number, each showing a single full-length figure of a woman. An example is the three paintings in the Chigi Saraceni collection depicting three famous exemplary women - one from the Old Testament and two from classical history: the Jewish heroine Judith, the Carthaginian heroine Sophonisba, and the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. Each woman is represented with objects relating to the cause of her fame.The unknown artist who painted these panels is referred to as the Master of the Chigi Saraceni Heroines.

06327-13winter.jpg	Bathed in a gentle, suffused light, softened by the snow, a Brabant village sets the scene for the pleasures on the ice. On the far horizon, we can just make out a city enveloped in mist. With its intimate framework, this surprisingly modern little picture is totally different from the panoramas to which Patenier and his followers had accustomed us. The unity of the ivory-toned colours makes this an almost monochrome painting, heralding the Dutch winter scenes of the coming century. The aerial perspective is, however, traditional, conferring a timelessness to the work. The landscape is painted with great freedom: playing with the combined effects of tiny impasti and translucent glazes, the painter has created a dialogue between the opaqueness of the snow and the reflections of the frost, the cold tones of the ice and the dark colours of carefully positioned trees and vegetation. Specialists remain, however, divided on this masterpiece: some believe that Bruegel painted it on his own, others with the help of his workshop. Several versions and numerous copies of this composition exist, some of them as late as the 18th century.The representations of winter scenes originate in the calendars of the Books of Hours. It may be that the artist is alluding to the winter of 1564-65, which was particularly severe, according to the chroniclers of the time. However, this scene probably contains a deeper meaning, attached to an allegorical interpretation of human existence that was widespread in the 16th century. According to this concept, the devout person is a pilgrim, crossing a life sown with dangers and temptations, which he must avoid in order to arrive at salvation. Hence the bird traps, like the one in the right hand foreground, symbolised in the literature of the time the baits of the devil for careless souls (the bird being traditionally the symbol of the soul). Similarly, artists frequently used skating scenes to express the uncertain (slippery) nature of existence. Skaters and birds meet here in their insouciance and their vulnerability towards the perils facing them. With his at once precise and synthetic vision of the world, the artist has managed to renew this theme with masterly skill.

28931-quaiaugu.jpg	The reception of Impressionism in Canada began about a decade later than in the US in the 1890s. Though the fashion for Canadian artists after 1890 was to study in Paris at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts or the leading private academies, it was rare for them to grapple with the technique of Impressionism. When they did, it was either a case of direct imitation of the French model, as with Helen McNicoll, or - and this applied to the majority - of briefly adopting a style as a transition to other approaches.

06238-3tondo3.jpg	Four tondos with the Evangelists still adorn the pendentives that once supported the old cupola of the Cappella Capponi in the church of Santa Felicit&#224; in Florence. Except for the painting of St John, the precise authorship of the other three portraits has posed considerable problems for scholars. As Vasari only attributes two of the tondi to Bronzino, without specifying which, scholars are still divided over which and how many of them were painted by Bronzino, the apprentice to Pontormo. Probably Bronzino was responsible for the St Matthew with an intense gaze, half-closed mouth, and tousled red hair, painted with thickly laid-on and glowing brushstrokes and enlivened by the strong light that falls on the figure with a swirling crimson cloak, set against the dark background. Probably also Bronzino's is the St Mark with its palette of yellow and red tones contrasting with the green of the mantle wrapped around the figure, which looks as if it is peering through a window, an idea drawn from the Gospel.The bald St John with a long beard seems to share the same uneasy and sorrowful humanity lavished on the body of Christ in the Deposition by Pontormo in the same chapel, this tondo can certainly be attributed to Pontormo. St Luke is probably also a contribution by Pontormo.The figures of the Evangelists, with their distinctly Michelangiolesque flavour, have a vigour deriving from the way their heads are twisted and pushed forward. They are wrapped in ample robes, whose bold colours stand out against the dark backgrounds. This play of strong contrasts, which exalts the delicate outlines of the coloured surfaces, is in keeping with the refined style of the entire decoration of the chapel

24349-forestfl.jpg	Marseus van Schrieck was one of the first painters to specialise in this type of still-life and his pictures were imitated by a number of artists. This still-life represents a milk thistle, mushrooms, a wood snail, a blue, a queen of Spain fritillary, an emperor moth, a tortoise shell, a dragon-fly, together with an aspis adder taking a fledgeling from a nest of a sedge-warbler.Marseus van Schrieck was fascinated by the animals which he painted and their behaviour. He knew the habits of these creatures very well and is known to have bred snakes, lizards and insects himself. It therefore seems that many of the detailed flora and fauna contained in his paintings were based on careful study of the various animals, insects and plants he discovered and kept in his own garden, a 'watery' domain near Diemen

They manage to combine poetry with faithful realism in the way they capture the feel of the climate and season. He succeeded in catching the movement of the early fall wind which was pushing the clouds along and drying the washing on the line. He painstakingly and lovingly portrayed the simple colours of the stones, the roof tiles, the clothes people wore, and the way the leaves are just beginning to turn colour.

31785-crucifix.jpg	"There can hardly have been any Netherlandish panel painters after around the middle of the 15th century who did not employ motifs deriving from Rogier van der Weyden, at least occasionally. But his influence extended far beyond the Burgundian Netherlands. In Italy, motifs from those of the master's paintings present in that country were adopted. Very few French pictures of the period have been preserved, but those that are extant often borrow motifs from Rogier.But it was in the German-speaking territories, from Lower Saxony to Austria, that his art met with the greatest response. As in the Netherlands, it ranged from extensive copying and attempts to imitate Rogier's style to the citation of memorable figures, and finally to independent reworking of his pictures. The nature of these echoes, of course, also depended on how the painters had come to know the pictures. Some German artists visited the Netherlands, generally during their journeyman period, and could have been in contact with Netherlandish workshops there. Others would have known Rogier's art only indirectly, through German artists who were already familiar with it, and from imitations. Finally, imported works by Rogier or his immediate successors played a part in the distribution of his pictorial ideas that should not be underestimated. In Cologne, for instance, the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) exerted a lasting influence on both native and foreign artists into the early 16th century. In the Crucifixion on his Hof altarpiece, completed in 1465, Hans Pleydenwurff of Nuremberg used figural motifs from a small Deposition (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) from Rogier's circle which had obviously made its way to southern Germany at quite an early date. In fact, the Nuremberg painter shows such familiarity with ""Netherlandish realism"" that he must have had previous contact with modern Flemish painting.This Crucifixion panel, with three others, belonged to the high altar of the church of St Michael, Hof. Pleydenwurff executed it with the participation of assistants in his workshop. The groups around the Virgin Mary and the centurion contain motifs from a Deposition after Rogier that found its way to Franconia quite early. At the same time the powerful, broad-headed figures and the colouring illustrate both the local tradition of Nuremberg and also Pleydenwurff's own artistic temperament."

Their patron saints stand to the rear (from left to right, James the Great, Anthony the Great, Agnes and Clare).The donors were identified. Jacob de Ceuninc was initially recorded as a monk at the hospital in 1469-70, and later as bursar from 1488 until his death in 1490. Antheunis Seghers was first mentioned in 1455-56 and appears to have been master from 1461 to 1465, bursar from 1466 to 1468, and then master again from 1469 until his death in 1475. Agnes Casembrood was first recorded in 1445-46, and subsequently appears as prioress from 1459 to 1463, and again from 1469 until her death in 1489. Clara van Hulsen makes her initial appearance in the records in 1427-1428, and died in 1479. Given that these are evidently intended as portraits, the altarpiece must have been ordered before the death of Antheunis Seghers in 1475, which means that its production may logically be linked with the expansion of the chapel's apse in 1473- 74 though we lack details of Jacob de Ceuninc and Clara van Hulsen in those years

14471-403fried.jpg	Throughout his life, Friedrich demonstrated himself to be closely attached to his home. His numerous trips and walking tours to central Germany, Silesia, Bohemia, Greifswald, Neubrandenburg and R�gen never actually took him very far away. He never visited southern Germany, for example, and his painting of The Watzmann - a mountain near Berchtesgaden, portrayed here rising like a Gothic cathedral in its stone majesty - was inspired by a watercolour by his pupil August Heinrich. It also rivalled a painting by Adrian Ludwig Richter of the same title, which went on show in Dresden in 1824 and was intended to back up Richter's application for the professorship in landscape painting at the Academy, the post to which Friedrich also aspired.Despite its apparent fidelity to nature, the painting reveals a somewhat fantastical element in its mixture of different geological formations and its unnatural ratios of scale

In these scenes Ghirlandaio succeeded in creating his own independent and unique images. Ghirlandaio moves the scene of the represented events from Rome where they took place to Florence.The events in the Confirmation of the Rule are taking place on the most important square in Florence, the Piazza della Signoria. The fresco represents the visit of the Saint to Rome to obtain the confirmation of his order from pope Honorius III.In the centre is the consistory hall decorated with gold drapes, and with prelates and personages witnessing the pope's blessing. The Medici family are also present, honouring Sassetti. Lorenzo de' Medici the Magnificent is easily recognizable on the right side, his profile rendered unhandsome by that squashed nose which deprived him (and his mother) of any sense of taste or smell and meant that he always spoke hoarsely, and his olive-complexioned face framed by a brown shock of rather shaggy hair. To his right is Antonio Pucci, now somewhat advanced in years, and Francesco Sassetti dressed in red; his young son Teodoro is by his side.On the left, dressed in red, stand the sons of the donor: Galeazzo, Cosimo, and also Teodoro, who had already died in 1478. In order to be able to fit all figures into the picture, some of the figures that had already been painted in the fresco had to be scratched off the wall. Thus, next to the donor's sons, there appears a monk without a body: he had been overpainted, but can now be seen again shining through the insufficiently thick layer of colour that was painted over him.Coming up the steps with their tutor are Lorenzo's two elder sons, Piero and Giovanni, and with them Giulio, the orphan of Giuliano who was killed in the Pazzi conspiracy, with their blond mops of hair, the solemn face of the former and the rather vague expression of the other who follows. Their tutor is Agnolo Poliziano, a man of letters, the composer of the 'Stanze', and a friend of Lorenzo who honoured him in his house.The three boys are with Matteo Franco, the kinder and more favoured tutor, whose descriptions with the pen accompany Domenico's paint-brush that lingers with such affectionate care on the pinkish, childlike features. The same precision is repeated by Ghirlandaio in the sharp profile of Franco's sworn enemy, Luigi Pulci, a caustic and irreverent character whose soul was imbued with a violent laical paganism. Harsh, bitter, poor and melancholy, he was protected mainly by Lucrezia Tornabuoni.In the background is Florence, with its most celebrated buildings: the Loggia dei Lanzia, the fa�ade of Palazzo Vecchio with its solemn raised podium that was later replaced by the present-day flight of steps; the gilded Marzocco lion (symbol of Florentine democracy); a back-drop of houses in the far left-hand corner and a bell-tower (possibly that of San Piero Scheraggio) where the Uffizi would later be built. In the background is a bustling of small figures, citizens and curious onlookers, possibly an opening and closing of shutters and, in places, a glimmering of gold in the capitals and arch of the consistory hall. A faint clear light passes over the soft colours, mellowing even the severity of the stones in the distant buildings. It is the history of Florence, fixed for ever, that passes by and comes to rest in front of us

15900-01youngm.jpg	In portraiture, as in other areas of painting, the tradition established by Bellini was transformed in the first decade of the sixteenth century by Giorgione. In contrast to the reserved formality of most fifteenth-century portraits, Giorgione introduced a new quality of soulfulness and intimacy into portraiture. He also expanded its expressive range by introducing motifs and compositional devices associated with other types of picture, so that in some cases it becomes difficult to decide whether or not a portrait-like image is meant to represent a real person. His younger contemporaries continued to explore the possibilities that he opened up for portraiture and related images for at least a decade after his death.The colours of this brilliant portrait are unfortunately faded due to an overcleaning before 1939

03391-3women.jpg	Pedralbes once a village or small town, is now one of the suburbs of Barcelona. It is the site of a convent of the Order of St Claire which was built around 1326. There, in the chapel of St Michael, are Ferrer Bassa's frescoes, depicting scenes from the life of Christ.The influence of fourteenth-century Italian art is more clearly discernible in the work of Ferrer Bassa than in that of any other Spanish painter. He was active between 1324 and 1348 and his pictures are closely modelled on those of Giotto whom he greatly admired. There is in the work of both artists the same compositional structure and the same reticent range of colours. The sepulchre behind the figures shows an attempt to convey the feeling of space; the tree in the background represents the latest trend of the period; the three-quarter view of the faces is also something seen in the work of Giotto. The gestures of the three women and the angel are almost identical, an indication that Bassa, though undoubtedly talented, was by no means an innovator

11935-iii_bela.jpg	The Viennese Academic painter Istv�n Dorfmeister, who moved to Sopron as a young man became the most productive artist of the last third of the 18th century in the part of Hungary lying west of Danube. A significant part of his monumental paintings have historical subjects, conveying the political messages of the enlightened clerics and the national aspirations of the Hungarian nobility. A scene from the Battle of Moh�cs was, for example, incorporated in the decoration of the reception hall of the Cistercian Abbey of Szentgotth�rd as a counterpart of the pannels capturing the Battle of Szentgotth�rd. The main episodes from the history of the Cistercian Order of Hungary provided the theme for the series, beginning with the foundation of the Order.The painting B�la III Founding the Cistercian Monastery at Szentgotth�rd in 1183 was made in 1795-1796. It captures the moment when the French monks were received in front of an antique porticus. The king and his escort are shown wearing colourful Hungarian costumes. In the background we see the distant view of 18th-century Pest-Buda, with a few medieval details added; behind the monks the imaginary view of the Romanesque Church and Abbey of Szentgotth�rd is depicted. The pure forms, the simple light effects and the use of light colours - the stylistic marks of Late Baroque mixed with the elements of Neo-Classicism, so appropriate at the end of the 18th century - suggest an optimistic view of history, which is a rarity in Hungarian art

12309-51franci.jpg	"The Madonna of the Franciscans shows structural articulation, and was probably part of a diptych or triptych intended for private worship, perhaps of a small group of Friars Minor. Iconographically it follows the ""Madonna of Mercy"" type: while looking towards the spectator the Virgin holds back the edge of her robe the better to receive and protect the three kneeling friars, for whom the Child's blessing is intended.This elaborate intermingling of echoes from Cimabue and Byzantine art, with the added softness of Duccio's personal touch, includes elements of the new artistic language from beyond the Alps. The tiny square panels of the backcloth, an innovation substituting the usual gold ground, are of clear French derivation. Thus, the measured breadth of contour, the sinuous curving of the robe's hem and the smooth masses of colour form part of a wider spatial dimension, where the Gothic predilection for linearity and flowing outlines reaches its maximum expression. The features of the supplicating friars and the throne, a simple wooden seat placed obliquely to create an effect of perspective, reflect the teaching of Cimabue. The unusual posture of the Child's legs belongs entirely to Duccio, however, who repeats the gestures of the early Madonna of Buonconvento and the Rucellai Madonna"

29306-314muril.jpg	Murillo was one of the leading artists in seventeenth-century Spain, surpassed in his lifetime only by Vel�zquez. Both artists were from Seville, but their temperament, careers and critical success could hardly have been more different. Vel�zquez spent the greater part of his life at court in Madrid. Murillo remained in Seville, painting mainly religious subjects for pious foundations; his death was the result of a fall from a scaffold in the Capuchin church in Cadiz. His secular paintings included a few masterly portraits, but otherwise consisted almost entirely of scenes of childhood, an unprecedented genre in Spain.Murillo's fame eclipsed Vel�zquez's through the eighteenth century, when he was ranked second only to Raphael and influenced, among others, Gainsborough and Reynolds. Only around 1900 did his manner, so well attuned to the religious sensibilities of his time, begin to cloy. For Murillo is the great interpreter of a range of feelings we have come to mistrust: avoiding scenes of martyrdom, he specialised in tender Holy Families, lovable infant saints, graceful Madonnas and Immaculate Conceptions. In later life he was charmingly reassuring even in his portrayal of vagrant children. But the emotional springs of his work were not what they might seem to a twentieth-century viewer. The youngest of fourteen siblings, his parents died when he was nine, and he outlived his wife and all but three of their nine children. From 1635 Spain was interminably at war throughout Europe. In 1649 half the population of Seville died in the plague; there was a popular uprising in 1652. As the world about him sank further into grim despair, it was not sentimentality but heroism which impelled Murillo to cloak his painted world in clouds of incense and of roses. The visitor who flinches from uplifted eyes and pink-cheeked cherubs should perhaps first focus on the firm drawing of the hands, here masterfully foreshortened and individually characterised in eloquent communion. The artist's impeccable draughtsmanship, at first sight concealed under the 'vaporous' brushwork of his late style, influenced by Rubens and Van Dyck, is the visible sign of his underlying stoicism.Murillo had treated the subject of the Two Trinities before, early in his career, when he depicted the Holy Family returning from the Temple (Luke 2:51). The compositions of both pictures derive from sixteenth-century engravings made for Jesuit devotional books by the Flemish Wierix brothers. These images, designed to appeal to a broad lay audience, stressed the humble labours of the Holy Family, and glorified Saint Joseph, carpenter, protector of the Virgin and earthly father of Christ. As God the Father, the dove of the Holy Spirit and Christ form the Celestial Trinity, so Mary, Joseph and Jesus mirror them on earth in a Terrestrial Trinity. In this painting, probably commissioned as an altarpiece, Joseph - the only character directly to address us - holds the flowering rod, sign of God's will that he become Mary's husband. The Christ Child is raised on a dressed stone, both a compositional device to set him at the apex of a triangle in the centre of the painting and symbolic: 'thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion...a precious corner stone, a sure foundation' (Isaiah 28:16). As the clouds part to reveal the divine light, their shadows temper the bold red and ultramarine blue, the apricots, pinks, gold and white of the highlights to a wonderful overall harmony, a haze of grey, sky-blue and saffron

14910-early12.jpg	In the late summer of 1885 Gauguin travelled to London on business and this painting may have been produced during that trip. The work is quite unique in his oeuvre, and seems to represent a self conscious attempt at fusing the ingredients of different cultures, worked in an avant-garde style. The horse's head is borrowed from the Elgin Marbles, on display in the British M�seum, and coupled with Japanese fans and a puppet of the type that were popular in Paris at the time. Such plunderings from non-Western sources was later to become commonplace in Gauguin's work, when he used them deliberately to attempt to create a 'primitive' flavour. However, it is the handling of the work that makes it unique, for the loose brushwork of earlier Impressionist style paintings has been systematized into the pointillist technique used by Seurat and Signac at this time. Gauguin has rejected the methods of the Impressionists and attempted to paint in the manner of the most advanced Parisian artists

20412-1warlord.jpg	B�la Iv�nyi Gr�nwald, like all the other members of Holl�sy's circle in Munich, was greatly influenced by the fine naturalism of Jules Bastien-Lepage. Right until his Nagyb�nya period, he painted in a similar style. The War Lord's Sword (1890), a painting worthy of the standard set by Bastien-Lepage, is set apart from his other paintings from the same period; in this painting, just like in Bastien-Lepage's works, the rustic scenes are depicted with tender sympathy.This painting takes us back to the world of legends dealing with the origin of the Hungarian people. According to the legend, in Attila the Hun's time a shepherd found God's sword standing thrust into the earth. The king interpreted this as a manifesation of God's will, and set off to conquer the western world with the sword. Iv�nyi depicted this scene very simple, in accordance with the rules of tonal painting. As a result, the painting is very different from the representative historical tableaux produced during the time of the Millennial celebrations

07995-dream1.jpg	We recognize this sleeping figure as Saint Catherine by the fragment of spiked wheel in the lower left corner, which was the instrument of an attempted martyrdom. Here Lodovico Carracci represented her legendary dream in which Mary and the infant Christ, accompanied by angels, appeared to her. Plighting his troth, Christ placed a ring on Catherine's finger, and through this mystic marriage she became his bride. To cast the event as a dream, rather than having Saint Catherine receive the ring while awake, is Lodovico's innovation.Two angels at the left look on with protective tenderness, while others barely emerge amid the vaporous bronze radiance at the right -- spirit becoming matter. The figures, solid and robust, bask in an indeterminate setting. A languorous warmth pervades the scene and slows the composition. At the same time, the quirky folds and pleats cascading down Catherine's garments impart a vertiginous sensation -- the dizziness of sleep.Lodovico was the eldest of the three Carracci, the family of Bolognese artists who inaugurated the age of the baroque. His depictions of saints in states of visionary ecstasy were highly prized in an age when the purpose of religious art was to arouse intensely pious emotions in the spectator

22815-miracle.jpg	Although he was born in Li�ge and also worked there, Lambert Lombard was an important figure in the development of the Antwerp School of painters. He lived in Rome for two years, and was a passionate archaeologist, art historian and man of letters. It was his erudition and knowledge of Italian art that attracted gifted young artists like Frans Floris and Willem Key to become his pupils. Both of them were to continue their career as artists in Antwerp, where they played an important role, especially Floris. Among the few works by Lombard that we know, The Miracle of the Loaves and the Fishes is generally regarded as one of the most important. The varied pleats and folds of the costumes derive from the language of form of classical antiquity which inspired Renaissance artists, while the landscape remains firmly in line with Flemish tradition

36580-gericaul.jpg	G�ricault's death at the age of thirty-three came about as a result of an infection following a riding accident, but the circumstances were never satisfactorily explained, and G�ricault was thought to have neglected various ailments from which he was already suffering, and even to have attempted suicide. He had struggled to win artistic recognition, and there seemed a tragic inevitability about his end. It was fitting that the Salon of 1824 - often called the 'Romantic' Salon for including so many icons of the movement - should also have contained the moving memorial to G�ricault painted by Ary Scheffer.

38663-portrai1.jpg	In 1654, Gerard Terborch moved to Deventer, where he created a market for his portraits among the upper class, with which he was associated both through his family and through political connections. The Marienburg family belonged to Deventer's ruling class. Willem Marienburg I and his son Willem II each held the office of burgomaster for a time. In the 1660s Terborch was commissioned to portray both generations with their respective wives as two pendant pairs. The oval portraits of Willem I (1590-1648) and his wife Geertruida Assink (1602-1679) are now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, while the portraits of Willem II (1634-1711) and his wife (and niece) Geertruid Marienburg (1645-1722) are in Prague.The pendants of Willem II and his wife exhibit the typical features of Terborch's elegant portrait style, which he cultivated in the 1660s, and which set his work apart from the established portrait types otherwise prevalent in the Netherlands

05240-12ecentr.jpg	Like the Tabletop of the Seven Deadly Sins, the Haywain shows mankind given over to sin, completely unmindful of God's law and oblivious to the fate which he has prepared for them. In this image, however, Bosch focuses on one of the Deadly Sins: the desire for worldly gain, or Avarice, whose sub-categories are elaborated in the adjacent figure groups very much as they are in the old handbooks on the Virtues and Vices. Avarice leads to discord, violence and even murder, all of which are graphically depicted in the open space before the cart. If the princes and prelates complacently jog along behind the cart, holding themselves aloof from this struggle, it is because the haystack is, so to speak, already in their possession; they are guilty of the sin of Pride. Avarice also leads men to cheat and deceive; the man wearing a tall hat and accompanied by a child at lower left is most likely a false beggar. The quack physician in the centre has set up his table with charts and jars designed to impress his victim; the purse at his side stuffed with hay alludes to his ill-gotten gains. Several nuns at lower right push hay into a large bag, supervised by a seated monk whose gluttonous tendencies are revealed by his ample waist.The meaning of some of the other groups remains unclear, and we may also wonder at the presence of the lovers on top of the haystack. That they illustrate the sin of Lust we know from the appearance of similar figures in the Prado Tabletop, but it might be argued that the pursuit of the pleasures of the flesh involves the expenditure rather than the accumulation of earthly goods. A class distinction may perhaps be observed between the rustic couple kissing in the bushes and the more elegantly dressed group making music. Their music is certainly that of the flesh, for the devil near by, piping some lascivious tune through his nose, has already lured their attention from the angel praying at the left

05255-11shipfo.jpg	"In The Ship of Fools "" Bosch is imagining that the whole of mankind is voyaging through the seas of time on a ship, a small ship, that is representative of humanity. Sadly, every one of the representatives is a fool. This is how we live, says Bosch--we eat, dring, flirt, cheat, play silly games, pursue unattainable objectives. Meanwhile our ship drifts aimlessly and we never reach the harbour. The fools are not the irreligious, since promiment among them are a monk and a nun, but they are all those who live ``in stupidity''. Bosch laughs, and it is sad laugh. Which one of us does not sail in the wretched discomfort of the ship of human folly? Eccentric and secret genius that he was, Bosch not only moved the heart but scandalized it into full awareness. The sinister and monstrous things that he brought forth are the hidden creatures of our inward self-love: he externalizes the ugliness within, and so his misshapen demons have an effect beyond curiosity. We feel a hateful kinship with them. ""The Ship of Fools"" is not about other people, it is about us.  "

The difficulty of dealing with a solid gold background, requested by the patrons, is solved here by Piero by placing the kneeling members of the confraternitas (who commissioned the altarpiece) in the realistic space created by the Madonna's mantle, held open around the figures like the apse of a church.

00846-20_cruci.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 20 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.Over the course of the commission for decoration of the dormitory, Fra Angelico's direct participation in painting the frescoes seems to have diminished, while that of Benozzo Gozzoli and his other assistants increased. This is especially evident in the images of the Crucifixion with St Dominic in the novices' cells 17 an 20 of the south corridor, on which construction began in 1441. The frescoes were completed in only two days each. They seem to have been painted almost entirely by Benozzo Gozzoli, as is evident in the linear description of Christ's idealized anatomy, especially his ribcage, and the uninflected modelling of Dominic's habit

14167-023love.jpg	Fragonard repeated the compositions of the two small pendants known as Love as Folly, and Love the Sentinel numerous times during his career, two pairs are in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. The various versions of the compositions are usually dated to the early 1770s on the basis of style. Their light colour scheme, rapid brushwork, and lighthearted subjects are similar to numerous paintings, often in oval format, that Fragonard produced in the years around 1770. During this period he was at work on his most celebrated cycle of decorative paintings, the large canvases called the Progress of Love, painted around 1771-72 at the request of Madame du Barry for her pleasure pavilion at Louveciennes outside Paris and now in the Frick Collection, New York. The present works related closely to two of four overdoors associated with this commission.These compositions and their variants typify the kind of quickly painted, small-scale decorative pictures that Fragonard frequently produced during his career

17167-portra19.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 439, JH 1673.In his letters to �mile Bernard van Gogh often expounded his conception of the portrait, illustrating his argument with constant reference to seventeenth-century Dutch portraiture. Hals and Rembrandt, he argued, had been first and foremost portraitists, but not in the sense of mere producers of facial resemblances. In their work, viewed as a whole, they produced a 'portrait' of a whole society, a lively, healthy and sane republic. Van Gogh wanted to achieve a comparable social representation, but the social relations of modern times were not as sane and healthy as in theirs. His project was both reactionary and utopian, and inevitably more limited. So he planned to paint the family of the disaffected republican Roulin, the postman. The project was conceived in the summer of 1888, pursued during that autumn, and finally accomplished in 1889. His first portrait of Roulin, a seated, three-quarter-length painting in which the sitter is facing to our right, is close to the portrait of Madame Roulin. She is also a seated, three-quarter-length composition, but faces left. The format is that of the pendant pairs of marital portraits common in seventeenth-century Dutch painting. The portrait of Roulin illustrated here was painted after the final one of Madame Roulin but it is linked with it, despite compositional differences, by the use of a decorative floral background, against which the head is set

42649-351seat.jpg	Inaccessible to scholars except through old photographs, the picture was for many years either dismissed or ignored completely, but, following recent extensive examination and analysis and also some light cleaning and restoration, its authenticity is now no longer disputed by any of the leading scholars of Vermeer.The painting represents a musical theme familiar from several of Vermeer's larger paintings, in particular the two in the National Gallery, London. It shows a young woman, three-quarters length, seated on a chair of rich blue velvet, her hands extended towards the keyboard of the virginals, a variant of the same instrument shown in one of the National Gallery's paintings. She is dressed in a yellow woollen shawl above a white satin dress or skirt, with pearls around her neck and an arrangement of red and white ribbons in her hair. As in Vermeer's other small canvases, the figure and instrument are set against a plain wall, without any other compositional elements such as windows, curtains or background paintings; yet despite this, the artist has created a highly convincing and atmospheric impression of space and depth, thanks to the depiction of minute irregularities and holes in the plaster of the wall, and the presence of a delicate, unified light, which comes, as in most of Vermeer's interiors, from the top left of the composition.

02775-basketfr.jpg	"Typically, Italian and French fruit still-lifes in the 17th century tend towards a strictly objective description of the actual phenomena. The Dutch, on the other hand, were still in the tradition of ""disguised symbolism"" (Erwin Panofsky) as something that gave depth to empirical precision. Balthasar van der Ast's Fruit Basket, for example, contains enough additional elements to show that he is concerned with more than a realistic rendering.The vanitas theme is emphasized by the presence of bruises, bad spots and wormholes, as well as insects such as butterflies, dragonflies and house flies, as well as a lizard - a rather unusual sight on a table - which is nibbling at one of the apples outside the basket. Grapes of course, often has a christological reference. If we consider further that, in the context of Virgin Mary, apples symbolize redemption and victory over sin, whereas insects and lizards were often associated with the principle of evil, then this harmless everyday motif suddenly turns into a scene (though on a smaller scale) of good versus evil in the history of salvation"

35714-marsh.jpg	Among Ruisdael's most personal creations are his large forest scenes of the sixties. In the Marsh in a Forest of about 1665 at the Hermitage powerful trees form a mighty group around a lonely pond. The decayed ones speak with their winding branches as vividly as those in full growth. There is more spaciousness now than there was in the earlier phase of the fifties. Massive trees no longer virtually seal off middle and background vistas. One can look into the distance under the trees, and the sky plays a more pronounced role. There is air all round, and the local colour, which was very distinct in the bluish green of the fifties, is somewhat neutralized by a greyish tint in the bronze-brown foliage.In this particular picture Jacob van Ruisdael based his composition on a design of Roelandt Savery which was accessible through the engraving of Egidius Sadeler. Yet the transformation of the Mannerist's work into his heroic terms is more significant than the dependence on it. Ruisdael did not accept the bizarre and ornamental play with nature's forms. He created an archetype of the splendour and grandeur of nature

30222-4ducale31.jpg	The present decoration of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Palazzo Ducale was realized after the disastrous fire of 1577 during which all the structures of the ship's-keel Gothic ceiling and the wall-paintings were destroyed. An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings. The canvases were dedicated, thematically, to the Glorification of Venice, in remembrance of the numerous military undertakings in the East or on the mainland by the Venetian ground troops. On the ceiling great importance was given to the victories of the Venetian army in conquering the mainland; along the wall to the dispute between Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa, who reached an agreement in Venice with the political mediation of Doge Sebastiano Ziani; and to the events of the Fourth Crusade, led by Doge Enrico Dandolo in the early years of the 13th century.Palma Giovane's Reconquest of Padua by Andrea Gritti is one of the thirty five panels on the ceiling of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio

26263-02menzel.jpg	Adolf Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel, German painter, engraver, and illustrator was one of the most prominent German painters in the Realism movement. He became successful in Berlin in the second half of the 19th century. Noted for numerous paintings and illustrations relating to events in Prussia's recent history, he was a chronicler of the life of Frederick the Great (reigned 1740-1786). He is known for portraits, industrial scenes, intimate studies of interiors, and local religious events.Menzel's Storm on Tempelhof Mountain was painted only six years after the death of Caspar David Friedrich. This small-format picture is an example of a completely different conception of the role of landscape painting. Menzel's art is significant for its break with the German tradition of landscape painting. With Blechen, Menzel was a pioneer  of realistic landscape with no symbolic content or didactic purpose, of which the composition and colour adhere strictly to nature

03043-08nativi.jpg	An idyllic representation of the frequently painted subject from one of the most peculiar German Renaissance artists.By electing to portray the main figures simply and quietly at the back of the stable, Baldung draws the eye first to the ruined architecture and the ox and ass seen in larger scale on the left. His construction of the interior embraces the opposite poles of precise foreshortening - as in the incisively drawn plynth in the foreground - and perspective uncertainty, something heightened by the differences in scale between animals and the figures. Viewer irritation and Mannerist alienation are quite clearly not the artist's aims, however.With the help of painted light, whose source seems to lie beyond the natural world, Baldung portrays the miracle of the Holy Night with what is for him an unusual depth of feeling. The infant Jesus, held in his swaddling bands by putti, seems to radiate light onto Joseph's red coat and Mary's hands and face. Through the brick archway in the cracked, plastered wall, we glimpse a second miraculous vision: an angel encircled by a radiant glory is appearing to a shepherd watching his flock. The fusion of light and shade and the soft modulation of the contours suggest that Baldung may have come into contact with the Danube School.

38565-gallery2.jpg	"Art cabinets belong to the Flemish tradition of ""Kunstkamers"" (Cabinets of Curiosities) paintings. This genre appeared in Antwerp at the beginning of the 17th century and included paintings of interiors covered in works of art. In fact, it is relatively common to see these paintings portraying collections that actually existed. It was for this reason that David Teniers the Younger was put in charge of compiling a richly illustrated in-folio catalogue illustrated with all the paintings belonging to Archduke Leopold William. This collection figured among the most prestigious in Europe and served as a basis for the rich collection of paintings at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. In 1658, the famous Theatrum Pictorum saw the light of day; Teniers was responsible for copying all the Italian paintings from the Archduke's collection into a small format.

Friedrich emphatically rejected pure fidelity to life, the mere imitation of what was perceived by the human eye. Only on a few occasions does Friedrich appear to have attempted a more realistic approach, as for example in the unusually dramatic Rocky Ravine.

15640-gentlema.jpg	Vittore Ghislandi was the son of a quadraturista and as a young man often helped his father paint the illusionistic perspective decorations in which he specialized. Ghislandi took vows as first as a lay-brother and then as a friar in the Order of St Francis of Paola. After some time in the Paolotti Monastery in Venice he moved back home to the Galgario Monastery, whose name he adopted. We know little about his work as a painter before the beginning of the eighteenth century. By then he was over 40 years old and it may have been Salomon Alder who suggested that he start to concentrate on portraits. In any case he ended up specializing in them exclusively. Although he was abreast of what was going on in the creative worlds of Milan, Bologna, and Venice, he preferred to look for his inspiration to the local tradition in Bergamo, in particular to the work of Gian Battista Moroni. Thus started an abundant number of portraits of noblemen and ladies from the local aristocracy.Fra Galgario showed no mercy in the way he starkly depicted their physical and moral reality. Fra Galgario's portraits (some of which are in museums in Bergamo and Milan but most still in private collections) are extremely varied. This is thanks also to the richness of his palette and loaded brush. It was precisely this vivacity, combined with his sureness of composition and peremptory way of capturing the sitter's psychological make-up, that makes the Bergamo portraits a faithful mirror of provincial life in the eighteenth century.In this portrait the gentleman represented wears a tricorn hat bordered by a silver decoration; his face is framed by a grey wig secured to the neck by means of a black ribbon resembling a fashionable tie. Underneath the silk jacket we can recognise a metallic waistcoat bearing the stem of a knight order, specifically a red cross with four lilies. This was the symbol of the Holy Constantinian Order of St George, a group linked to Byzantine traditions which in the early eighteenth century had many followers in northern Italy. However, the precise identity of the man represented is still unknown.

38294-families.jpg	Stubbs was born in Liverpool, the son of a leatherseller, and it is tempting to imagine that it was among the tack and harness in his father's shop that he first came into contact with that English world of hunting, racing and horse breeding of which he became the quintessential interpreter. It was a world in which dukes metaphorically rubbed shoulders with stable lads, great landowners with Smithfield meat salesmen, society ladies with Newmarket jockeys, and men and women of all degrees with horses and dogs. 'Master of the art of class distinction', as the art historian Judy Egerton has remarked, he neither flattered nor mocked, but painted with profound 'acceptance of things more or less as they are'. In the words of Mary Spencer, his common-law wife for some fifty years, 'every object in the picture was a Portrait'.In his effort to paint people truthfully Stubbs studied anatomy at a medical school. The better to portray horses he dissected them, teaching himself engraving to publish The Anatomy of the Horse. Although he may have wished to establish himself as a 'history painter' in the academic mould, he seems to have retained from his trip to Rome in 1754-6 only the memory of an antique marble of a lion attacking a horse. This subject preoccupied him for over thirty years and is the one theme in his work that comes nearest to evoking the 'pity and terror' of epic narrative. Stubbs's gifts of invention had to do not with story-telling but with abstract design.The poetic effect of Stubbs's combination of dispassionate observation with pattern-making is beautifully demonstrated in this small full-length group portrait of - from left to right - the seventeen-year-old Elizabeth Milbanke, her father Sir Ralph Milbanke, her brother John Milbanke, and her husband Sir Peniston Lamb, the future Viscount Melbourne. Although this kind of picture, popular in England in the eighteenth century, was called a 'conversation piece', the human sitters here converse no more than do the light tim-whisky carriage, the horses or Sir Peniston's spaniel. This failing must be the result of Stubbs having studied each figure-group separately from the others, and from a different angle. We may be meant to imagine that the grander Milbankes are welcoming the ineffectual parvenu Sir Peniston. (His promotion to a viscountcy in 1784 was a result of his wife's affair with the Prince of Wales.)Complete in itself, each vignette - as precise in its delineation of character as it is accurate about costume, complexion, coat, harness, or curvature of wheels seen in perspective - is carefully placed alongside the others to suggest a gracefully meandering yet uninflected line across the painting, along which each person and animal is given equal stress. The frieze is contained within the canvas, turning inwards at the edges. Stubbs often added an imaginary landscape backdrop only after he had satisfactorily deployed his figures, and certainly this is what he must have done here, arranging masses of foliage and cliff, voids of sky, contrapuntally to the figural melody. And that 'vital but endlessly silent' communication among them (in David Piper's beautiful phrase) is forged in the shapes and tones of the spaces around them, the rhythms created by the curving necks and croups of horses, the legs of men and beasts, the sharp accents of tricorn hats, of rose, blue, buff, bay, grey

09368-haywain.jpg	John Constable's father was a wealthy Suffolk miller. Constable's truthfulness to nature and devotion to his native scene have passed into legend. Less widely known, however, is his biographer's report that it was seeing Claude's Hagar and the Angel (now in the National Galleery, London) and watercolours by Girtin which first provided him with 'pictures that he could rely on as guides to the study of nature'. Ruisdael, Rubens, Wilson and Annibale Carracci were among other 'reliable guides' whose work he copied as a young man. He also learned from contemporary painters, never forgetting the advice given him by Benjamin West, the President of the Royal Academy: 'Always remember, sir, that light and shadow never stand still...in your skies... always aim at brightness...even in the darkest effects...your darks should look like the darks of silver, not of lead or of slate.'Constable's youthful exclamation, 'There is room enough for a natural painture [i.e. style of painting]', must be understood not as the outpouring of a 'natural painter' but as the proclamation of an aspiring student struggling for proficiency in the language of art, which shaped his deepest feelings before he could give expression to them.The Hay-Wain, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 and at the British Institution in 1822 under the title Landscape: Noon, was one of the big 'six-footers' on which Constable worked in the winters in London from sketches and studies made in the country in summer. The harvest wagon of the modern title was copied from a drawing made by John Dunthorne, Constable's childhood friend and assistant, and sent at Constable's request from Suffolk. The view is of farmer Willy Lott's cottage on a mill stream of the River Stour near Flatford Mill, of which Constable's father had the tenancy. A full-scale sketch for the picture is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In this final version Constable omitted a figure on horseback at the edge of the stream, substituting a barrel which he later painted out (but which is beginning to show through).In thus 'selecting and combining' from 'some of the forms and evanescent effects of nature' Constable sought an 'unaffected truth of expression' without the loss of poetry. He laboured 'almost fainting by the way' to preserve the sparkle of sketches in these large paintings worked over for many months in the studio. The Hay-Wain, that best-loved icon of the English countryside, was admired by Constable's closest friends but did not meet with success at the London exhibitions. He sold it in 1823 with two other pictures to an Anglo-French dealer who exhibited them in the 1824 Salon in Paris. There at last Constable's achievement was understood. A cast of the gold medal awarded to Constable by King Charles X of France is incorporated in the picture's frame

22907-gradenig.jpg	Jacopo Gradenigo occupied various positions but it seems probable that the portrait was painted at the time when he was chief admiral, for the city visible in the background was found to be Corfu, the seat of the holder of this office. This opinion is supported by the sitter's age, which corresponds with the time during which he held this position.The arrangement is that of an official portrait: the naval officer standing in a haughty posture, with a hardly noticeable smile on his lips, holds his admiral's baton and faces the painter. But Longhi avoids the purely professional approach and offers instead a colour symphony of red and gold, of pale and vivid hues; he reveals, too, in the likeness his own ironical aloofness. He was introduced to the craft of painting by his father; he later became a pupil of Giuseppe Nogari but was to some extent also influenced by Piazzetta.

03754-013pieta.jpg	"In addition to the ""Madonna and Child"", another recurring theme in Bellini's work is the ""Piet&#224;"". This subject too has the Byzantine origin of the imago pietatis iconographical models used in Venetian art. Venice, furthermore, was responsible for the introduction in the West of the so-called ""Passion Portraits"", whose function was to establish an empathetic dialogue between the dead Christ with the wounds of the martyr and the faithful contemplating Him. The faithful, besides being moved by the sacrifice of Christ, draws consolation for his own pain through the observation of divine suffering. In Bellini's work, for example, the Piet&#224; of the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo and that of the Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan are the prototypes of a series of variants showing the body of the dead Christ over the sarcophagus, with his head bowed and his hands positioned as if for burial. This is an iconography that originated in Constantinople, even if in Italy it was thought to derive from a famous miraculous Roman mosaic-icon, the one of Santa Croce in Jerusalem, which according to legend had appeared during Mass to Pope Gregory the Great.The Bergamo painting is a harsh work, marked by a dramatic force which, in rather uncustomary fashion, the artist renders with the expressionistic masks of suffering of the Madonna and St John. The hands of the mother and son are clasped tightly together in a strong plastic join of Crivellesque inspiration, which in the past led scholars to suppose it was the work of a Ferrarese master. Nor should we underestimate the importance that the particular fascination of the Paduan altar of Donatello still held for Bellini at this time.The painting is signed at the bottom as ""IOHANNES B."" The inscription at the top is illegible"

07659-carlev04.jpg	With the help of central perspective, the artist leads the eye of the spectator from the Ducal Palace, over the Molo to the Fonteghetto della Farina, where the entrance to the Grand Canal is marked by the silhouette of Santa Maria della Salute and the Punta della Dogana. Further to the left, behind a throng of gondolas and other boats, we can see the hazy profile of the Giudecca.Owing to the many figures in the foreground, the canvas seems to transcend the genre of the veduta. The schooner behind the gondolas in the left foreground has just fired a salute. A group of dignitaries crosses the Molo in the direction of the Ducal Palace, among them Procurators recognizable by their red robes. A curious crowd watches the procession; it includes many figures also found in Carlevaris's lively oil studies of daily life in the Serenissima.Carlevaris is not the inventor of this veduta: long before, in the 1660s to be precise, the French artist Israel Silvestre made a print of roughly the same view. The Venetian master is undoubtedly responsible for the sense of grandeur about the scene, achieved by raising the vantage point and adding the panorama on the left. Carlevaris often employed this device - especially to represent diplomatic receptions, for which he was famous - shifting the point of view slightly each time. He situated these events in front of the Ducal Palace, where the newly appointed ambassadors presented their credentials to the Doge and Senate, the climax of a ceremony that lasted altogether several days. The Entry of the Earl of Manchester into the Doge's Palace, which the Earl himself commissioned in 1707, is one of the masters best-known works in this series and also one of his two earliest veduta.The Reception of Cardinal C�sar d'Estr�es represents a similar event, so similar, in fact, that until recently this canvas was assumed to be an autograph variant of the English reception. Judging from the staffage, however, it was not a repetition. Unlike the Entry of the Earl of Manchester a French, not an English mission is shown here, witness the fleur-de-lis on the Ambassador's gondolas in the left foreground. Furthermore the composition draws attention to the prelate in the midst of the crowd; since only one French ambassador to Venice held an ecclesiastical office - Cardinal d'Estr�es - the reception must be his.C�sar d'Estr�es (1628&#151;1714), a bishop of Laon who was created cardinal in 1672, was a seasoned diplomat. In January 1701 he was sent to Mantua and Venice to convince them to deny the imperial army passage to Milan despite their neutrality on the issue of the Spanish succession. D'Estr�es' mission proved fruitless inasmuch as the Republic refused to alter its position; in April the prelate left empty-handed for Naples to join the Spanish king. Carlevaris may have received and executed the commission during the three months the Cardinal spent in Venice or shortly thereafter. Though it is still unclear whether Venice or the diplomat himself took the initiative, the latter possibility seems most likely, given the fact that most of Carlevaris's paintings of diplomatic receptions were prompted by the ambassadors involved.The scarcity of information about Carlevaris's work prior to 1703, the year of publication of his famous series of engravings, Le Fabriche, e Vedute di Venetia, accounts for the importance of this painting. A handful of landscapes and several capricci are all that is known of his oeuvre before then. His first documented commission for painted vedute only dates from 1705, while the two earliest, securely dateable works in this category were executed two years later. The Reception of Cardinal d'Estre�s is thus probably the first indication of Carlevaris's competence in this genre; more importantly, however, it is arguably the prototype of the eighteenth-century veduta.

05828-2erasmu.jpg	St Erasmus was the bishop of Formia, near Gaeta in Italy, during the 5th century. According to legend, he was put to death by the Arian Lombards and died in the most terrible agony. Bouts represents St Erasmus virtually naked and stretched out on a board, to which he is bound by his hands and feet. A hole has been cut in his belly and one end of his intestines tied to a winch. Two executioners are busy disembowelling him. One is old and bald, and works with his sleeves rolled up, winding the handle of the winch with great vigour. The other is young; he seems to be disturbed by what is happening, and goes about his task with less enthusiasm. Behind them is a bearded figure, wearing a rich coat of blue and gold brocade trimmed with fur. He surveys the torturers with an attitude that is both simple and dignified. From the way he leans on his stick, you might think he was overseeing some administrative formality. Of the three men with him, only one looks directly towards the scene, while the other two ignore it as if it were an event of no importance. Despite the horrific nature of the act, there is no sign of any blood anywhere. The wings of the triptych show, on the left, St Jerome resplendent in his cardinal's robes, with his emblematic lion at his feet, and on the right, St Bernard wearing a plain habit, and holding his abbot's crook in one hand.Behind the figures, a landscape extends across all three panels of the triptych. The green hills and the roads that run between them have been identified with the rolling countryside around Leuven. The brilliance of the light and colours in which nature is rendered here is so extraordinary that one feels this must be the result of the first-ever exercise in open-air painting. Bouts was a master of landscape art, as his contemporary Johannus Molanus was already aware. Even such a brutal subject as the disembowelling of Erasmus, when cloaked in Bouts's ethereal light, is invested with a certain tranquillity. Nature is no longer an artificial decor, an obviously false theatrical backdrop, as it appears in 15th century Italian painting, but an atmosphere rendered down to the finest detail, where close attention has been paid to every nuance of colour

32546-portrait.jpg	In this painting, the somber hues of the woman's dress and the dark green of the background are effectively set off against her white blouse and lace collar. Her motionless expression gives her an air of distance and nobility			
04191-madonna.jpg	The background of this small panel records the lyrical feeling of a calmly contemplated landscape. Seen with an eye for detail, the panorama includes a path going up to the church, two horsemen in conversation, a view of the town, and figures in a boat. The intensity of the background is to some extent dissipated by the foreground of the painting. Here the somewhat distracted and independent compositional device of the heads revolving around the Child suggests a desire to create an effect of distinction and beauty that the delicate forms can scarcely sustain. In the gestures of the hands plucking at the air or touching things without grasping them (the Madonna's carnation, St. Catherine's crucifix), there is almost the ingenuousness of a miniature painter. Another instance is the Virgin's mantle, which swells up to support her prayer book.As a whole, however, the composition is complex and almost scholarly. Two diagonal connections are set up, not merely to divide the surface of the work but to create a spatial perspective. They connect the figures above and below, and inversely link the foreground and middle ground, converging in the figure of the Child or rather in the tangle of hands in the middle. Foppa's silvery hues have become here a tremulous gray, which extends from the draperies into the faces and the hands. A high note is struck by the yellow of the Child's shirt, and there is a sober response in the colour harmonies of the Madonna's robes

14982-1paris03.jpg	Despite the prominence and importance of titles in Gauguin's art, their meaning is often far from evident, and there seems to be a degree of capriciousness in their choice. It is far from clear who is posing the question here and indeed why, although the woman's insistent gaze seems to suggest direct communication with the spectator. It is possible that it was posed to the artist himself by the archetypal Tahitian woman, since Gauguin was to leave Polynesia later that year. If that is so, then the ripe exotic fruit she nurses to her breast becomes a symbol of the sensual gratification he will leave behind by going back to French 'civilization'. Quotations from other paintings are included, most notably the crouching maiden from Nafea faa ipoipo, who acts as a further reminder of what he will miss

00203-holyfami.jpg	Albani is a typical representative of the reform movement introduced by Carracci. As a student of the Bolognese artists and a colleague of Annibale who collaborated on the decoration of the Aldobrandini lunettes, he had developed a degree of confidence in his choice and application of stylistic means that allowed him not only to handle large wall areas, but also to create small and intimate devotional pictures.In his Sacra Famiglia or Holy Family Albani finds that characteristic blend of sovereign grace and delicacy that today's spectator may find slightly disturbing. Those of us who regard such emotional emphasis and charm with some suspicion tend to forget the specific tasks and needs these pictures were intended to fulfil in order to satisfy a highly educated and cultivated group of buyers. The usual setting for pictures on this theme was a niche in the bedroom of a patrician house or palace intended for devotional purposes. This function also explains some of the typical traits of such a picture: the intimacy of a family gathering, framed by fragments of great architecture, the gestures of devotion of the two angels and the meditative attitude of the elderly Joseph - all signals with which the contemporary spectator would have been able to identify clearly

35056-luteplay.jpg	This monumental and powerfully modeled figure of a musician tuning a lute can be linked stylistically with Bartolomeo Manfredi's work, strongly suggesting that it was executed towards the end of Rombouts short stay in Rome. The composition ultimately derives from Caravaggio's two versions of The Lute Player, however, the theatrical clothing and the somewhat menacing demeanour of the figure's expression are closer to the representations of male lute players by the Utrecht Caravaggesque painters like Dirck van Baburen and Hendrick Terbrugghen.

05460-301magni.jpg	"Botticelli created his Madonna del Magnificat in the early 1480s. At the time, it was in all likelihood his most famous picture of the Virgin, something indicated by the five contemporary replicas which we have of the painting.The painting was lavishly covered with gold paint; like the Raczynski Tondo, it contains nearly life-size figures. The Virgin, crowned by two angels, is depicted as the Queen of Heaven. Two of the wingless angels are crowning the Queen of Heaven. The crown she is wearing is a delicate piece of goldsmiths work consisting of innumerable stars; they are an allusion to the 'Stella matutina' (morning star), one of the Mother of God's names in contemporary hymns devoted to Mary.There is such a complex solution to the sequence of crowded figures in front of the stone window that it is possible to look out between Mary and the angels on the left onto a broad landscape laid out according to the rules of atmospheric perspective. The three angels have moved towards the Virgin and Child. The one at the front is kneeling and holding an open book and inkwell. Encouraged by the Christ Child, the Virgin is about to dip her quill and write the last words of the Magnificat, beginning on the right page with the large initial ""M"". The pomegranate which the mother and child are both holding is a symbol of the Passion and adds to the basic melancholy and meditative mood of the painting.The background of the picture opens out into a landscape, in similar manner to the background in the Madonna del Libra where the open window allows the observer a glimpse of the view outside. These landscapes point to the influence exerted upon Botticelli by contemporary Netherlands' artists such as Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden and Hubert van der Goes. Trading relations between Italy and the Netherlands had been growing more intensive since the 15th century, resulting in many Florentine merchants and bankers travelling northwards. Among the mementos which these people brought back were paintings revealing other artistic conceptions and ideals. The Italian painters particularly admired the detailed execution of individual pictorial motifs, the realistic fashioning of the figures in the pictures, and the atmospheric effect of the landscapes as rendered in the art of their colleagues north of the Alps, and each incorporated the motifs of the latter into his own pictures after his own manner.This portrait of the Virgin represents the costliest tondo that Botticelli ever created: in no other painting did he employ so much gold as in this one, using it for the ornamentation of the robes, for the divine rays, and for Mary's crown, and even utilizing it to heighten the hair colour of Mary and the angels. As the most expensive paint, gold was normally used only sparingly. Its liberal employment here will therefore have been at the express wish of the person commissioning the work."

18250-0611grec.jpg	A priest and a nobleman, probably the patrons who commissioned the painting, are shown praying before Christ on the cross. (It is assumed by some scholars that they are the brothers Diego and Antonio Covarrubias.) El Greco has included realistic details such as the drops of blood trickling from Christ's forehead, hands and feet, while leaving his torso and legs unstained. Light and shadow model Christ's musculature, the elongation of his contorted body enhancing a sense of his suffering. Above his head a sheet of paper stuck to the cross informs us in Hebrew, Greek and Latin that he is Jesus of Nazareth, with the additional ironic words in Greek hailing him as the King of Jews.The influence of Michelangelo - whose works El Greco would have known in Rome - is recognized in the depiction of the naked Christ.

34905-03catala.jpg	This mural, removed from the wall of the church of Santa Maria at Tahull, is one of the most famous surviving examples of Catalonian Romanesque painting. The artist of this painting is referred to as the Master of Tahull.The rigid hieratic saints or Christs enthroned seen in earlier works are here replaced by a vivid and expressive representation of the fight between young David and the champion Goliath, who is depicted in chain armour and armed with a spear and shield. When the fresco was first made it included a scene in which David and Goliath were depicted side by side, David using his sling and Goliath slain by the stone. These details have been damaged beyond restoration and there remains only this scene in which David beheads Goliath. Here too the colours have faded in the course of centuries. In the Romanesque fresco we see the decorative manner of representation characteristic of the Mozarabic miniatures, that is to say, the fight is not shown as taking place in any particular landscape setting, but is depicted against a background divided horizontally by lines similar to the fesses of a heraldic escutcheon. There is also some of the crudeness seen in miniatures, for example, the exaggerated size of the hands. But the fresco represents a conscientious effort to depict the story with great accuracy, for these murals served not only to decorate the church but also to instruct the people in Biblical history.The artist clearly attempted to give the faces of David and Goliath certain individual features, introducing also such realistic details as the carrion bird beside the body, the lively drapery of the cloak and the Jewish cap on David's head. The fresco dates from a period when the fight between David and Goliath was thought of as an Old Testament manifestation of the struggle between Christ and Satan.

02970-selfport.jpg	In this vanitas still-life, the border between the two genres of the still-life and the portrait are blurred.On the one hand, there are several portraits (as painting within the painting) forming part of a still-life arrangement on the table. The arrangement includes, among other things, a skull, an extinguished candle, coins, a wine glass on its side, a pocket watch, roses, a pearl necklace, a pipe, books and sculpture. Soap bubbles hover above them as symbols of transience.On the other hand, the entire collection functions as a statement about the young man on the left, whose face displays the typical features of a self-portrait. It may therefore be somewhat irritating that the artist was in fact 67 years old when he painted this picture in 1651.However, the contradiction can be solved when we consider that his current features are shown in the small oval portrait, demonstratively held out towards the viewer - a medium which in itself already documents the transience of life. The youthful artist's face, by contrast, shows Bailly as he was at an earlier stage in his life, more than four decades previously. Thus, by changing the time references of past fiction and present reality, the painting suggests that the young artist is anticipating his future age, which - though part of the present in 1651 - appears to belong to the past, as conveyed through the medium of the portrait. The young man, who appears to be so real within the first-degree reality of the painting, really represents a state of the past.Unlike the repetitive, dull and often schematic topics of Dutch vanitas still-lifes, the misleading time scale in Bailly's painting adds a new dimension to the whole subject

08644-01ray.jpg	The painting is one of the artist's diploma pieces, on the occasion of his reception into the Acad�mie royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1728.Artists who were not members of the Acad�mie, and who therefore could not exhibit their work in the Salon, took part once a year in what was known as the 'Salon de Jeunesse', held on the feast of Corpus Christi in the open air, in the Place Dauphine, and lasting two hours. On 3 June 1728 Chardin exhibited several pictures there, including The Ray and The Buffet. Some academicians who saw the work persuaded Chardin to present himself for membership of the Acad�mie royale; on 25 September of the same year, contrary to the usual practice, Chardin was accepted and admitted on one and the same day. The Acad�mie did not insist on a picture specially painted for the occasion, as was usually the case, but retained The Ray and The Buffet as his diploma pieces. It is related that the artist had deceived several academicians, among them Largilliere and Cazes, by showing them some of his still-life paintings which they took for Flemish works. Certainly, the source of inspiration is obvious in The Ray, which surpasses the best work of Jan Fyt.The rich quality of the paint surface, which is in perfect condition, has been revealed by the recent cleaning of the varnish. The picture is exceptionally well preserved for a work by Chardin; his paintings often suffered from too heavy a use of oil with his pigment.

35359-01religi.jpg	Peter Paul Rubens, the genius of European Baroque, painted his Deposition during his first stay in Rome. Rubens provides us with an extraordinary interpretation of the theme of the incarnation of the divine and human nature of Christ, suspended between death and potential future life. All the shades of the spectrum of light are apparent in the flesh tones, with an opalescence that develops that mother of pearl quality first introduced by Federico Barrocci.The impact made on Rubens by Roman statuary can be seen in the antique altar with sacrifice scenes, but above all in the strong sculptural high relief of the figures. The dense chromatic texture of the composition owes much Titian's later works, while the airy vibrato and gentle rhythms echo Correggio's achievements. The light unexpectedly bursting through the dark area of the painting provides evidence that Rubens competed in an original way with the chiaroscuro experiments of his contemporary Caravaggio

20257-singeri4.jpg	"Singerie is the French word for ""Monkey Trick"". It is a genre depicting monkeys apeing human behaviour, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild satire. Singeries were popular among French artists in the early 18th century, though the term is most usually reserved for a type of decorative painting associated with French Rococo. It originated with the French decorator and designer Jean Berain, who included dressed figures of monkeys in many of his arabesque wall decorations. The emergence of singerie as a distinct genre, however, is usually attributed to the decorator Claude III Audran, who in 1709 painted a large picture of monkeys seated at table for the Ch&#226;teau de Marly. In France the most famous such rococo decor are Christophe Huet's Grande Singerie and Petite Singerie decors at the Ch&#226;teau de Chantilly.The six canvases by Huet, which depict monkeys dressed up as humans and engaged in various country leisure activities, originally formed part of the decor of a salon in the Ch&#226;teau de La Norville. The salon had paneling by the sculptor Nicolas Pineau, which framed the six singeries. In his design, Pineau positioned four of the canvases - The Fishermen, The Dance, The Picnic, and the Concert - as overdoors, while installing the remaining two - The Painter and The Sculptor - above pier glasses"

04804-cremona2.jpg	The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht D�rer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy D�rer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.A majestic aura fills the space of the Annunciation to Mary. The angel in white garment approaches forcefully, with a grand gesture. On the floor the angel's garment and the red cloth of Mary's prie-dieu gently touch. Mary humbly leans her upper body forward slightly and at the same time looks up, facing the heavenly messenger

40741-09icon.jpg	Among the oldest Church feasts of the Christian East is that of the Transfiguration of Christ on Mount Tabor. This feast was depicted on the mosaic in the apse of St Catherine's monastery on Sinai as early as 565. The iconography here remained binding: the transfigured Christ stands in an aureole between the prophets Moses and Elijah, while the first three apostles to be called, Peter, John and James, throw themselves to the ground in fear, dazzled by the supernatural light.We can see the same arrangement on this icon. Christ is standing on a sharp rocky outcrop in a radiant white garment, giving the blessing with His right hand and holding a closed scroll in His left. He is surrounded by an oval aureole of light, in which is inscribed a rectangle with inwardly curving sides, from which rays emanate towards Elijah and Moses, each standing on his own mountain summit in an attitude of veneration. Three further rays strike the three disciples, who have thrown themselves to the ground in prayer. To this basic scheme of the depiction of the event, this icon adds two others, which respectively precede and follow the Transfiguration. On the left, Christ is climbing the mountain with the three disciples, while on the right we see the descent

37046-2apocal1.jpg	According to the prediction in the Scriptures, the deeds of the Antichrist take place immediately before the end of the world, in those last days when 'the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken' (Mark, 13: 24-25).For his description of the end of the world the artist had to make do with the narrow spaces on either side of the entrance door to the chapel. He was thus forced to divide the scene into two narrative sections. To the right he describes the first signs of the Apocalypse, which has been the object of prophecies since earliest times. In the foreground, in the lower part of the painting, he has shown King David and the Sibyl, as witnesses of Dies Irae. The stars go pale, fires and earthquakes sweep the earth, war and murder spread throughout the world. The lefthand section recounts the epilogue of this preannounced catastrophe.

07691-iphigeni.jpg	In the Greek mythology Iphigenia was the daughter of Agamemnon, king of Mycenae. Her father lead the Greek forces against Troy. The expedition was at first prevented from sailing by unfavourable winds, so Agamemnon consulted a seer, Calchas. He was told that, because he had killed a stag sacred to Artemis (Diana in Roman nomenclature), he must propitiate the goddess by sacrificing his daughter to her. Iphigenia accepted her fate out of patriotic motives. According to some, at the last moment Artemis substituted a stag for the human victim and carried Iphigenia away to be her priestess. The winds changed and the Greeks were able to sail.In this painting Giovanni Andrea Carlone captures in detail the point at which Agamemnon had intended to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to the goddess Artemis. The goddess obscures the scene with cloud and snatches her from the sacrificial altar leaving in her place a deer

26517-0doniton.jpg	Michelangelo probably realized this famous picture about 1506, on the  occasion of the birth of Agnolo Doni and Maddalena Strozzi's first daughter. (Few years before Raffaello had painted the portraits of Agnolo Doni and his wife, now conserved at Palatina Gallery in Florence).Highly significant of the artist's style, the group with the Virgin, Saint Joseph and the Child shows the peculiar twisting of the limbs and the evidence given to body's muscles, a pattern that clearly appears in michelangiolesque sculpture. Brightness of colours, lighting effects, emphasize impressiveness of the sacred figures. The nudes on the background, whose poses and gestures are all connected to classical sculptures, symbolize pagan mankind, the world before coming of Christ; on the right the little St John indicates the passage, through the baptism, from the pagan age to the christian age.Restored in 198

06805-scenes2.jpg	The story of Tobit, a book from the Apocrypha, was a particularly popular text because it is devoted to the wanderings of a boy, Tobias, in search of a cure for the blindness of his father, Tobit. Throughout his journey, Tobias is protected by a guardian angel, Raphael, and accompanied by his faithful dog. As so many young Florentines were commercial travelers or apprentices, often at worrisome distances from home, their parents had sufficient grounds for concern. Tobias' happy tale, along with its reassuring filial piety, was one they seldom tired of telling, whether in art or life.Two grand, richly narrative friezelike images, known as 'spalliere' are ascribed to Bugiardini. The first panel shows, from left to right, Tobias taking leave of his parents, journeying with Raphael to catch the fish whose liver will cure Tobit, his engagement to Sarah, and their bridal night. The second panel presents Tobias leaving Sarah after a dance and banquet, his mother on a hilltop in the background

14815-certosa.jpg	The Lay Brothers' Choir in the Certosa was used by the unconsecrated members of the community who provided the physical labour required for housekeeping. Its sumptuous decoration makes it one of the more outstanding of the charterhouse's common spaces. Striking accents of this room are the frescoes by Domenico Gargiulo covering all the walls with small-figure picture panels and the elegant choir stool made by Francesco d'Arezzo. Contributing to the harmonious impression of the overall space is the stucco decor in muted colours, which, like the richly adorned lavabo, harkens back to Cosimo Fanzago.

22486-11youth.jpg	A synthesis of the physical and intellectual, the face of this young man becomes the focal point of the painting. Soft blue, gray and beige in contrast with brilliant red emphasize the face, while the window frame encloses the head. The world without is suggested by the blue sky, but no landscape is permitted to detract from the figure. Filippino still depends upon the teaching of his master, Botticelli, in his use of line, but he adds to it a bolder use of paint in modeling the form of the face and costume

24782-virgin2.jpg	Like the Virgin and Child before a Firescreen (in the same museum), the picture shows the Virgin Mary in a cosy domestic setting. She has either just bathed, or is about to bathe, the Christ Child in front of the fire. The scene corresponds to no passage in the Gospels, but is inspired by the devotional literature which was widely current in the Netherlands at the time. We are invited to marvel at the humility of Mary, a modest - if surprisingly well-to-do - townswoman; at her maternal devotion - she does not rely on a nursemaid to care for her child; and at the tender affection between her and her son. More profoundly, we are led to reflect on the Incarnation: Christ has truly become man, touching his genitals like like any baby boy. His mother is without doubt the Virgin, for she wears her hair loose like an unmarried girl or a queen at her coronation. Haloes radiate from both their heads. The lighted candle may symbolise the marriage candle, for she is not only the Mother, but also the Bride of Christ.Through the refined manipulation of thin layers of translucent oil paint, the artist is able to depict three light sources - the window, the sparking fire and the steadily burning candle - and the surface textures of many different materials, from the gleaming metal of the water basin to the velvet brocade of cushions and bench covering. Almost more magically, he is able to evoke the distant sky through the open window and through the small leaded glass panes above. These wonderful details were surely meant to capture and hold the close attention of the viewer, and lead him or her (and perhaps more particularly her) effortlessly to meditate on the spiritual values embodied here.The painting was probably executed by the workshop of the Master of Fl�malle (Robert Campin). The original frame and support are carved from a single piece of wood

41960-ascensio.jpg	Vald�s went back to C�rdoba in 1654 for a final two-year stay and began one of his greatest creations, the altarpiece for the church of the Shod Carmelites. This work eventually would comprise twelve pictures and take three years to finish (two canvases are dated 1658). One reason for the delay might have been the painter's decision to leave C�rdoba and settle permanently in Seville. Vald�s's return coincided with the appearance in Seville of Herrera the Younger, who profoundly affected him. Herrera's impact is first noticeable in the Carmelite altarpiece, especially in the centrepiece, the monumental Ascension of Elijah, one of the greatest Spanish pictures of the period.The Ascension of Elijah plays a central role in the imagery of the Carmelite order, which claimed to have been founded by the Hebrew prophet. According to the Bible (2 Kings 2:11) Elijah was assumed into heaven from Mount Carmel in a fiery chariot. As he ascended, his mantle felt to the ground and was received by Elisha, an act that symbolizes the succession of the Carmelites to the prophet's legacy.In Vald�s's painting a spirited team of horses pulls the chariot toward heaven, while a yellow mantle drifts down into Elisha's outstretched arms. Vald�s has conceived the scene with an almost explosive theatricality. Fire bursts from the wheels and adornments of the chariot; flames are ignited by the impact of the horses' hooves. Even Elijah's beard seems ablaze as it is swept aside by the rush of the wind. On the ground below, a cool, placid landscape, filled with exquisite flora and fauna, is painted in subdued greens and grays that contrast with the riotous reds, oranges, and yellows of the flaming chariot

21721-v_vulcan.jpg	It is unusual for this often repeated mythological subject to be treated as a genre piece, although this occurs in Vel�zquez's celebrated picture in the Prado, Madrid.The problem of collaboration of the three Le Nain brothers is highlighted in the Venus at the Forge of Vulcan. It is dated 1641 which was during the last period when all three brothers were alive. In this painting the figure of Venus herself seems an uneasy adaptation of a Renaissance model. Perhaps including an obvious quotation was the artist's way of making it plain to the client that the picture had a well-known precedent.The rest of the picture, however, reveals great powers of observation. Especially perceptive are the two figures in the background, silhouetted against the light of the furnace. In all the French art of the seventeenth century, this is the first time that a painter has been able to observe nature without adding mannerisms of his own: even Georges de La Tour at his most realistic created an artificial world in which everything was secondary to his fascination with candlelight. Here, the figure on the left glances towards Venus in a completely natural way, and it is this naturalism, which occurs again and again in parts of their pictures, that sets the Le Nain brothers apart from all their French contemporaries.You can view other representations of Venus and Vulcan in the Web Gallery of Art

31809-3celebra.jpg	In this nocturnal scene Van der Poel takes us to one of the best-known buildings in Delft: the Gemeenlandshuis (Communal Land House) of Delfland, illuminated by torches, with rich ornamentation and coats of arms above the entrance. This Late Gothic house was built in 1505 as a residence for the dikereeve and bailiff Jan de Huyter. In 1645 it became the seat of the board of the Hoogheemraadschap of Delfland. The building occupies a prominent place on Delft's oldest canal, the Oude Delft, just south of the Prinsenhof, the erstwhile Convent of Saint Agatha and residence of William the Silent until his assassination in 1584. On the right in the painting, behind the bridge, one can make out the tower of the Oude Kerk. In front of the Gemeenlandshuis a crowd has gathered, captivated by the spectacle of the blazing torches and the fireworks in the night sky. The torches are made from barrels filled with pitch or tar and mounted on poles. They were usually paid for by the town or by private individuals on the occasion of a festivity.The painting is undated and contains no unambiguous indications of the nature of the event represented. Traditionally the picture has been interpreted as a depiction of the celebrations of the conclusion of the Treaty of M�nster, which was signed on May 15, 1648. In honour of this momentous event the States General ordered a day of thanksgiving and rejoicing on June 5, the day of the official announcement.Alternatively, it has been suggested that he scene shows the festivities on the occasion of the Hoogheemraadschap's installation in the Gemeenlandshuis in 1645. This interpretation explains the building's prominence in the painting, though such a well-known edifice may simply have provided Van der Poel with a readily identifiable Delft setting.

42284-0702vela.jpg	During the 1630s and 1640s Vel�zquez painted a series of portraits of the courtdwarfs, playmates of the royal children, for they interested him as character studies.For his pictures of the fools and dwarfs Vel�zquez often chose the format of a rectangle coming down close to the head, within which the figures crouch as if in a compact, closely circumscribed world; an example is the portrait the Dwarf Francisco Lezcano, painted by Vel�zquez around 1643-1645 as a retarded boy of fifteen. It was a burlesque piece that formed part of the decoration of the Torre de la Parada. The feeble-minded dwarf, dressed in green, is lovingly caressing the playing cards he holds. His bloated, over-large features are almost monumental, and a curious beauty plays over the face of the hydrocephalic dwarf

The two views of Florence in Budapest, the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, and its pendant, the Arno in Florence, are presumed to have been produced in the 1740s, when Bellotto made a long study tour of Italy and painted views of many Italian towns, including Verona, Turin and Florence. In these early works the influence of the older Canaletto is strikingly obvious: as tradition demanded, the young view-painter at his debut kept his construction compact and strictly observed the laws of perspective.

19361-wordswor.jpg	William Wordsworth (1770-1850) was an English poet who with Samuel Taylor Coleridge launched the Romantic Age in English literature with the 1798 publication of Lyrical Ballads. His masterpiece is generally considered to be The Prelude, an autobiographical poem of his early years.'High is our calling, Friend! Creative Art'. Thus William Wordsworth, the supreme Romantic poet of nature, addressed Haydon in a sonnet in 1815. Haydon was to repay the compliment later, by painting one of the most memorable portraits of Romantic inspiration, showing Wordsworth musing among the clouds, high up on the Lake District peak of Helvelly

42671-micault1.jpg	"This attractive triptych comes from the chapel of the Holy Sacrament in St Michael's Cathedral in Brussels, where Charles V's collector-general, Jean Micault and his wife Livine Cats van Welle were buried. The altarpiece was probably commissioned by their second son Nicholas in their memory. This is why they appear with their children on the wings, he wearing the mantle of the treasurer of the Order of the Golden Fleece, with his armour perhaps alluding to his having been knighted, she dressed in a black robe and a fur. Both carry little crosses in their hands, which shows that they have died, as do the adolescent boy to the far left and the girl in the plumed hat on the right-hand wing.The central panel illustrates the greatest of Christ's miracles, the resurrection of Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, after lying dead for four days. Apostles but also Jews, recognisable by their turbans, press round the tomb. Certain of them hold their noses or their throats, reminding us of Martha's words: ""Lord, by this time he stinketh"" (John 11,39). Martha, helped by Mary, is relieving Lazarus, sitting on the edge of his tomb, of the winding cloth in which he had been buried. At the bottom of the tomb lies his brownish corpse. Lazarus is looking at Christ with stupor. The strongly silhouetted figures standing round exude a certain coldness appropriate to an epitaph. It is the background landscapes, however, that provide the exceptional feature in this triptych, with their unusual oriental d�cor, albeit particularly appropriate for a biblical subject. From left to right, we recognise the bay of Tunis, the arena and aqueduct of Carthage, a Tunisian mosque, an antique-looking temple and obelisk, the aqueduct of Segovia, a primitive basilica, a domed tomb and a curious sarcophagus-shaped building.In fact Vermeyen had joined Charles V in Spain in 1533/34. From there he followed him to Tunis, where he was commissioned to immortalise the Emperor's battle there. The many sketches he made on this voyage served in particular for an unequalled series of twelve tapestries, ordered by Mary of Hungary a few years before the triptych. By selecting a context referring to the imperial expeditions for this painting, Vermeyen probably wanted to emphasise the close connections between the Micault family and the Habsburgs"

26014-07portr.jpg	It is in the area of portraiture that Hans Memling appears to have been the most successful, for which a vast patrician clientele existed in Bruges. He paints his models with an exactness, a precision and a concern for detail which bring them strongly to life. This applies to these two devotional portraits, attributed to him and which can be dated to around 1482.The man and woman, represented in half bust, face each other in an attitude of prayer. Both are positioned in a gallery opening onto a wide landscape. The man is wearing a purplish garment trimmed with fur under which a black doublet with a rising collar is to be seen. A black 'cornette' is hanging from his right shoulder. The woman wears a purplish dress with a low V-shaped neckline, edged with a black border typical for the 1470/80s. Around her neck she wears a transparent linen veil or 'gorgerette'. Above her drawn-back hair, her short truncated 'hennin' is covered with a fine veil which falls down over her shoulders. Her necklace consisting of a double row of chain-links is decorated with a pendant containing a pearl and two precious stones. On her left little finger she wears two rings. The top of a golden belt buckle is also visible, just under her chest.The sitters are identified by their coats of arms and inscriptions on the back of the two panels as Willem Moreel and his wife Barbara van Vlaenderberch, alias de Herstvelde. Willem Moreel, Lord of Oostcleyhem, was one of the richest citizens of Bruges where he was a spice trader. He was also a banker for the Bruges branch of the Banco di Roma. Between 1472 and 1489 he was successively a counsellor, then burgomaster, bailiff and treasurer of the city. He had five sons and thirteen daughters from Barbara van Vlaenderberch. In 1484 the couple also commissioned Hans Memling to paint a large altarpiece (Bruges, Groeningemuseum) for their chapel in the Bruges church of St James, on the side panels of which their entire family is represented.Originally these two portraits were part of a triptych, of a type intended for meditation and private devotion, the central element of which was a religious subject, probably here a Virgin and Child. The painting probably folded flat and had three equally sized panels. The man's coat-of-arms is featured on the rear of the woman's portrait, and will thus have been visible on the outside of the closed case. The exchange of escutcheons will, however, have been intended primarily as a kind of eternal link between the two portraits. Memling applied a similar procedure to the wings of the Last Judgment

21274-clytie.jpg	By 1687, the marble Trianon was nearing completion on the grounds of Versailles, and the following year a series of paintings was planned for each room.Mythology in its graceful rather than heroic form stimulated La Fosse's lively overdoor paintings, including the exquisite Clytie Transformed into a Sunflower.A Greek myth tells how Clytie, the daughter of a king of Babylon, was forsaken in love by the sun-god Apollo because he turned his attention to her sister Leucothea. Clytie's jealousy was the cause of her sister's death. She herself, still spurned by the god, slowly wasted away and turned into the flower that always turns its face toward the sun.

39823-2rovere1.jpg	Francesco Maria della Rovere (1490-1538) succeeded his uncle Guidobaldo da Montefeltre as ruler of Urbino. Though at first protected by his uncle Pope Julius II (Giuliano della Rovere), he lost power under the Medici Pope Leo X, but was able to regain his territories after his death. He was one of Italy's most important military leaders and frequently served the Republic of Venice.Perhaps because of the limitations of the court-portrait, perhaps also because he had not his sitter actually present - we know that the latter dispatched his armour to the painter at Venice with the request that he should hurry on the work - this portrait, although impassioned and full of pride, lacks something of the spiritual profundity of many others by the artist.In creating a pair of paintings of Francesco Maria della Rovere and Eleonora Gonzaga, duke and duchess of Urbino, Titian predictably reprised many of the themes seen in Piero della Francesca's double portrait of their predecessors, Federico da Montefeltre and Battista Sforza. Once again, the male portrait is more rugged and individualized, emphasizing military exploits and adventures. Francesco Maria poses alert in his stunningly rendered, glinting armor, his right arm and baton dramatically thrust out into the viewer's space. Behind him a splendid, plumed parade helmet, reflecting the vibrant, pulsating red of a velvet drape, faces a jauntily angled set of lances. In marked contrast, Eleonora Gonzaga sits primly in her chair, immobile within her highly detailed but much less lovingly depicted court dress. Her pet dog lies bored on a table in front of a window. Titian's landscape is expansive but untraversible, marked by a church tower in its idealized blue distance.Francesco Maria della Rovere (1490-1538) succeeded his uncle Guidobaldo da Montefeltre as ruler of Urbino.

23113-10carme2.jpg	This painting formed a panel of the predella of the dismembered altarpiece in the Carmelite church San Niccol&#242; al Carmine in Siena. The five scenes in the predella depict events in the history of the Carmelite Order: The Annunciation to Sobac, Hermits at the Fountain of Elijah, St Albert Presents the Rule to the Carmelites, The Pope Issues a Bull to a Carmelite Delegation, and The Approval of the New Carmelite Habit by Pope Honorius IV.This scene of the predella refers in a general way to the hermitic life on Mount Carmel that lasted over a thousand years. It depicts a rocky landscape on Mount Carmel, in the foreground the well which according to tradition was opened up by Prophet Elijah. Scenes from the life of Carmelite hermits are represented both beside the well and the background. The hermits wear the striated Carmelite habit, modeled after the cloak of Elijah, scorched as he ascended heaven in a chariot  of fire, and retrieved by his disciple Elisha

44581-1centra1.jpg	Girolamo Godi, organizer of a Vicenzan literary salon and friend of Pietro Bembo and Alvise Cornaro, engaged Gualtiero Padovano around 1550 to decorate the villa. In addition to the loggia, the decoration of four rooms in the right wing of the villa can be ascribed to Gualtiero: the Hall of the Gods or the Putto, the Hall of the Triumphs, the Hall of the Caesars, and the Hall of the Sacrifices. Gualtiero's sudden death in 1552 prevented him from completing the work which was taken over by Giovanni Battista Zelotti, who created the frescoes in the central hall, the Hall of Olympus, the Hall of the Arts, the Room of Seasons, and the Hall of the Muses. In the latter the contribution of Battista del Moro (c. 1515-c. 1573) is assumed.The frescoes in the Villa Godi represents the apex of Zelotti's work, thanks to the harmonious fusion of decorative elegance, careful chromatic relationships, and the skilful use of illusionistic perspective.In the central hall, imposing, monumental arcades with projecting trabeation, crowned by tympanums, stand out against the walls like stage sets, framing two episodes from the life of Alexander the Great. In a faux gilded frame, the allegoric scene Hercules at the Crossroads is depicted. The tall dado that runs around the room is embellished with small monochrome panels

18328-1302grec.jpg	The paintings for the high altar and side altars of the Chapel of San Jos�, Toledo, were begun end 1597; completed end 1599. The Chapel was dedicated to Saint Joseph, Saint Teresa's favourite Saint - 'the Father of my Soul' - for it was the original intention of the founder, Mart�n Ram�rez (d. 1595) to build a chapel for her (d. 1582). The paintings for the high altar (still in place) were the Saint Joseph and the Christ Child, and above, the Coronation of the Virgin; and, for the side chapels, the Saint Martin and the Beggar and the Virgin and Child with Saints.Saint Joseph and the Christ Child was the central painting of the high altar and probably the first of the series to be painted for the Chapel of San Jos�. Saint Joseph is shown as a figure of trust and protection to the Christ Child, who indicates the way. The colours, the rhythm of the tower-like figure of Joseph, express perfectly the meaning of the painting. There is no 'mannerist' ambiguity in the relationship of figure to setting. The subject is a parallel to that of Saint Anne teaching the Virgin, and is an extract from the theme of the Christ Child walking between the Virgin and Saint Joseph. It is at this time that El Greco begins to include a view of Toledo in his paintings. The view here is that of the Metropolitan Museum painting (none of the view is lost, for the figures merely divide it in two). The small signed version in the Museo de Santa Cruz is probably the model for the painting

The left panel consists of the following scenes: The Apotheosis of Augustine; The Coronation of the Virgin; Catherine Disputing with the Philosophers; Francis Receiving the Stigmata; and John the Baptist in the Wilderness. The scenes on the right panel shows six episodes from the life of Christ: The Nativity, Christ on the Cross, The Lamentation, Christ in Limbo, The Three Women at the Tomb, and Christ the Judge.Placed side by side, the two identically-sized panels illustrate in a refined palette and with the care of a miniaturist some of the most popular and emotionally charged biblical and apocryphal scenes which presumably resonated most strongly with the Medieval believer.This diptych is considered to be an important bridge between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries

The composition, known in two other autograph versions (one in Edinburgh from around 1590, and another in private collection from around 1578), has usually been interpreted as an allegory with some sort of moralising intent; it is unlikely that it was conceived simply as a genre scene.

00392-2scenes.jpg	One of Altdorfer's most ambitious commissions involved the execution of panels for the altarpiece in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florian near Linz, which was installed in 1518. Originally the ornate shrine must have resembled the great altarpiece of Saint Wolfgang by Michael Pacher, with an elaborate framework intricately carved about painted panels, and inner sculptures, but only the paintings remain intact. Now dismantled, most parts are at either Sankt Florian or Vienna.When the wings are opened, eight episodes from the Passion of Christ appear in two registers; closed, four scenes in the life of Saint Sebastian are presented. The predella displays four more painted panels, including the Entombment and Resurrection, Saints Margaret and Barbara, and the donor, Provost Peter Maurer. Altdorfer's drama of the Passion is intensified in emotion and superbly composed with four scenes that takes place in the darkness and four opposing scenes on the right, which occur in daylight.The first of the series, Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, is one of the finest examples of the artist's expression in themes of betrayal and violence. The threatening darkness of the night sky, striated by intense layers of red, does not conceal the nature of the sinister landscape of Gethsemane. In the foreground an eerie grotto of stalactites forms the uneasy stage for Christ and his three apostles, Peter, James, and John

35109-harbour.jpg	Signed on the plank at bottom centre: ROSA.Salvator Rosa, painter, poet, etcher and musician, was one of the most interesting artists of the Italian Baroque. He worked in Naples, Florence and Rome, painting mostly Graeco-Roman historical scenes, allegories, landscapes and battle scenes. He himself thought most highly of his figure compositions because of their moral and philosophic content, but even his contemporaries found these works too intricate and contrived, preferring his romantic and beautiful landscapes and violent battle scenes.This landscape, together with its companion-piece Rocky Landscape with Waterfall, was only recently recognized as a signed and authentic work by Rosa. Both pictures were yellow and darkened, with age, but cleaning restored them to their original beauty, and the signature, once believed to be a forgery, turned out to be genuine. When compared with Rosa's early landscapes in the galleries of Florence and Modena, similarities of style and subject are evident.The painting is mentioned in contemporary records and is known to have been acquired from the artist's friend Francesco Cordini for the Ambras collection by Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Tyrol, along with several other works by Rosa. It later passed to the Imperial collection in Vienna before being transferred to Buda Castle, and from there to the National Museum in Budapest in 1848

05492-moses.jpg	This fresco, located in the second compartment on the south wall, is opposite The Temptation of Christ also painted by Botticelli on the wall of the Sistine Chapel. The two pictures are typologically related in that both of them deal with the theme of temptation. Botticelli integrated seven episodes from the life of the young Moses into the landscape with considerable skill, by opening up the surface of the picture with four diagonal rows of figures.As the Moses cycle starts on the wall behind the altar, the scenes should, unlike the pictures of the temptations of Christ, be read from right to left: (1) Moses in a shining yellow garment, angrily strikes an Egyptian overseer and then (2) flees to the Midianites. There (3) he disperses a group of shepherds who were preventing the daughters of Jethro from (4) drawing water at the well. After (5,6) the divine revelation in the burning bush at the top left, Moses obeys God commandment and (7) leads the people of Israel in a triumphal procession from slavery in Egypt

05584-02lament.jpg	The stylistic changes in Botticelli's late work are especially striking in the two paintings of the Lamentation over the Dead Christ (in Munich and Milan). Botticelli was reacting in these pictures to the new religious sensibility in Florence.As in the earlier Lamentation in Munich, the scene is brought vividly close to the observer, in order to create feelings of sympathy in him. The group of mourners in front of the dark rock tomb is arranged in the form of a cross. At its top is Joseph of Arimathea.

The harmony of colour and original construction of the seemingly natural poses are remarkable.

38209-autumnla.jpg	This painting, depicting an autumn landscape with a shepherd and his herd and travellers near an inn, formed part of a rare set of six wall-hangings by the brothers Jacob and Abraham van Strij. Only very few complete or almost complete sets have survived, one of which, a set of seven, is now in the Dordrechts Museum, Dordrecht, and another set of five is in the Haags Gemeentemuseum, The Hague. Wall-hangings became very popular in the second half of the 18th century, when several factories in Amsterdam were established producing these wall-hangings for the canal houses. The workshop of the Strij brothers also produced wall-hangings which are often signed by only one artist, the main contributor, in this case Jacob. However, in most cases the hand of both painters can be seen.

24026-4sgeorge.jpg	In Padua there were many admirers of Donatello and the other Tuscan artists, but it was Andrea Mantegna who, with his frescoes in the Ovetari Chapel of the Church of the Eremitani, executed when he was just twenty years old, emerged as the reference point for the rebirth of painting over much of Northern Italy and Central Europe. In a romantic dream of the rediscovery of a classical measure, the world of Andrea Mantegna assumes a form in almost metaphysical terms where images stand out with solid plasticity in a space which has been rigorously marked out according to the extremely precise rules of perspective. This severe formal abstraction softens a little as far as the colour is concerned after Mantegna's visit to Venice to meet the Bellinis, whose sister Nicolosia the artist had married. The 'St. George' of the Accademia Galleries dates from a period later than the visit to Venice but before Andrea Mantegna left Padua forever in 1460 for the court of the Marquis Ludovico Gonzaga at Mantova.The saint stands serenely impassive in the marble enclosed space, just enough to one side to allow a bird's-eye view of the walled city from which leads the road he has just travelled to engage in his battle with the dragon. Against the stony landscape over which the cloud-laden sky hangs impassively, the figure of the saint within an incisively drawn outline is rendered with perfect perspective in the steady glare of light. Every detail seems to be inlaid in semi-precious stones; the metallic halo, the pure face, the elegant tournament armour, the open hand on his left side. This insistent interpretation leads to a definite and heroic monumental quality in the figure of the saint who is offered not as a symbol of Christian piety but rather of a new, much-yearned-for antiquity

39735-02tityus.jpg	Titian painted four large canvases of the Damned for Mary of Hungary, Charles V's sister and his regent in the Netherlands. They depicted Tityus, Sisyphus, Tantalus and Ixion, all condemned to perpetual torture for incurring the displeasure of the gods. Only Tityus and Sisyphus are still extant. Tityus was sentenced to have his liver perpetually devoured by a vulture for having raped Latona and Sisyphus to carry a rock endlessly up hill for gossiping about Zeus's affair with Egira. Their gigantism is Michelangelesque. In these two canvases, Titian achieves rich effects of colour and chiaroscuro with a limited palette in a foretaste of his late style.According to the literature, Tityus is modeled on a Michelangelo drawing of 1532, or another possible explanation is that the figure of Tityus is based on body parts of the falsely restored Laoco�n from 1532

38550-vertumnu.jpg	The small group categorized as Pre-Rembrandtists includes Pieter Lastman (c. 1583-1633), Jan Pynas (1581/2-1631) and his younger brother Jacob (1592/95-after 1656), their brother-in-law Jan Tengnagel (1584-1635), Lastman's brother-in-law Fran�ois Venant (1590/91-1636), and Claes Moeyaert (1590/91-1655).Beside Jan Pynas, Jan Tengnagel is the only other member of the group who is recorded as a traveller to Italy; he was there in 1608. His early works are so close to Lastman's that they have erroneously as the better known artist's autograph pictures, but he soon developed an original style marked by large figures seen close to the foreground that almost fill the picture plane with merely a small vista of a landscape in the background done in the predictable Elsheimer-Bril tradition.Tengnagel was at home working on a life-size scale. In 1613 and again 1623 he was commissioned to paint large group portraits of members of Amsterdam's Handboogdolen, one of the city's civic guard companies; both include self-portraits. He was a prominent public servant who held the position of deputy sheriff of Amsterdam from 1625 until his death a decade later. He apparently gave up painting about the time he assumed his important post; none of his existing pictures postdate 1624

30545-returncr.jpg	In answer to John Ruskin's rallying call for artists to eschew traditional history painting, Paton undertook two paintings of contemporary subjects; 'Home' in the context of the Crimean War (1854-56) and In Memoriam (private collection) relating to the Indian Mutiny (1858). 'Home' depicts the return from the Crimea of a Corporal in the Scots Fusilier Guards. He has been wounded in the head and has lost his left arm. The Crimean medal, awarded by Queen Victoria in 1855 to all those who fought in that war, is worn on his uniform and below the chair is a trophy - a Russian helmet lying beneath the soldier's stick. The mother weeps over his shoulder, while his wife kneels and embraces him. A small child sleeps in the cot. The open Bible on the table indicates the source of the family's strength in the soldier's absence. The subject is treated as domestic genre although the painting can also be interpreted as an implied criticism of the war.The picture shows a reduced replica which was commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1856. She gave it to the Prince Consort at Christmas, 1859

00570-polyptyc.jpg	Unlike Bartolomeo Vivarini, the early works of Andrea da Murano display the fullness of sculptural form and clarity of spatial structure which we note in the works of Giovanni Bellini. His masterpiece of this period is the polyptych, originally in the church of St Peter Martyr of Murano.Although conceived according to the traditional dividing up into compartments, with St Vincent Ferrer and St Roch in the centre, St Sebastian on the left, St Peter the Martyr on the right, and in the lunette the Madonna of Mercy with St Louis, St Dominic, St Bernardino and St Catherine, the palimpsest acquires a wholeness of vision through his confident mastery of perspective. Masters of the space within which they stand naturally on the gold ground, the figures have both a sculptural and a spiritual quality. In the three compartments, St Sebastian stands transfixed gazing sorrowfully upwards while the other saints motion benignly and reassuringly towards the devotees.The work was probably painted after an outbreak of plague, perhaps the one in 1478, as the saints in the lower register suggest. All were venerated for their miraculous powers against epidemics.The paintings in the lower register were transferred to canvas, the lunette remains on panel. The polyptych is signed lower centre: OPUS.ANDRAE.DE.MURIANO

11652-3doctor4.jpg	In the painted niches at the attic level stand eight monumental figures wearing Byzantine vestments and identified by Greek inscriptions. They are bare-headed and wear halos. Closest to the chancel are Sts Basil, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nazianzus, venerated as hierarchs in Eastern Church. Secondary to them are the doctors of the church Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus, as well as the church fathers Athanasius the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. The eighth figure is St Nicolas of Myra.The patriarchs' bright colours and animated faces have been traced to Venetian precedents; however, the pattern for the overall arrangement could have been the fifteenth-century papal portraits in the Sistine Chapel. The distinct shadows the figures cast on the wall are prefigured there.The picture shows the niche which is located above the scene of Meeting of St Nilus with Emperor Otto III.

37542-scene12.jpg	Scene 12 of the cycle on the life of St Benedict depicts Benedict receiving the two Roman boys Maurus and Placidus.This busy scene shows the definite influence of Pinturicchio's cycle in the Piccolomini Library in Siena. Sodoma's inspiration may well have been the coronation of Pope Pius III, which is similarly crowded with figures. Sodoma had lived in Siena since 1500, and there he absorbed much of Pinturicchio's world of dandified grooms and dense crowds filled with heraldic colour, making it a part of his own stylistic repertoire

26241-charles4.jpg	After a forced separation brought about by religious wars, in the eighteenth century there again appears, in the person of Anton Raphael Megs, an artistic link between the Spanish monarchy and German art. For many years Mengs resided in Spain where he left a prominent impression. Many of his portraits are preserved in Spain (in the Prado, Madrid) - works from the time of Charles III, of Charles IV, of members of the court of Naples and of the Austrian Empire - and all evidence a refined technique and masterly transcription of faces and details.This painting belongs to a series representing the portraits of the princes of Asturias

18433-2205grec.jpg	'And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God . . . And they cried with a loud voice . . . And white robes were given to every one of them . . .' (Revelation of St John, VI, 9-11).The Opening of the Fifth Seal is a large fragment of one of three altarpieces El Greco contracted to paint in 1608 for the church of the Hospital of St John the Baptist (the Tavera Hospital). Located just outside the walls of Toledo, the hospital was founded in 1541 by Cardinal Juan Tavera (1472-1545), who is buried in the church. Of this project for the altarpieces, three pictures survive: an Annunciation (Colecci�n Santander Central Hispano, Madrid, the upper portion showing a choir of angels has been cut and is in the National Gallery, Athens), a Baptism (installed on a side altar in the church), and The Opening of the Fifth Seal (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The painting has been cut at the top, where there was possibly a representation of the Throne: 'And immediately I was in the spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne . . . and round about the throne were four and twenty seats, and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders . . . And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book . . . sealed with seven seals . . .' (Revelation of St John, IV -V).In the foreground is an incredibly elongated, ecstatic figure of St John, his head turned imploringly heavenward, his arms raised. Behind him are two roups of figures. The three on the right, seen against a green drapery, are male and reach upwards for white garments distributed by a flying cherub. The four on the left are shown in front of a mustard-coloured cloth. Two are male, two female, and they seem to be covering (or uncovering) themselves with the yellow drapery. The Spirit as 'a living flame, striving upwards', and this strange compatibility of infinite darkness and 'all-consuming light' is met with in the writings of the mystics of his time, Saint Teresa of Jesus and Saint John of the Cross. El Greco realises the apocalyptical vision in colour, light and movement.This project was El Greco's last large-scale undertaking, and he did not live to complete it. The unfinished painting fittingly closes his career
