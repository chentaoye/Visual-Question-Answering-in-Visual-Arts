40176-rumor_er.jpg	This painting is part of the NELRI series, Troost's best known work. (The name is derived from the first letters of the Latin inscriptions which accompany the five views of the activities of a group of men during the night of a reunion.) In this series we are shown what happens during a gathering that begins quietly in the early evening and ends well after midnight with the participants dead drunk.Troost is often called the Dutch Hogarth. They were exact contemporaries, both made formal portraits as well as conversation pieces, the name given to small-scale group portraits in a social setting. Both won fame for their series of genre pictures, which are commentaries on the life of their times, and for pictures of contemporary theatrical performances. Also both are satirists, but here there is a fundamental difference. Troost is never as critical or aggressive as Hogarth. Troost does not moralize. Instead of moralizing on the evils of drink, as Hogarth was wont to do, Troost's NELRI pictures humorously show the stages as well as the psychological and physiological effects of inebriation. In this respect his spirit differs from Jan Steen's too. It will be recalled that moralizing was a dominant strain in Steen's art

06615-flowers.jpg	Unlike Bosschaert, Brueghel did not use landscapes as a background. Rather, protruding upwards from a flower pot, his myriads of flowers are set against a pitch-dark background, so that the contrast gives them a luminous quality. While Bosschaert preferred more cultivated flowers - rather costly at the time - and only depicted a few flowers of the fields and meadows among them, it is precisely these delicate plants that gave Brueghel the idea for 'tapestry' of flowers. Indeed, there is such an abundance of different species that they often defeat identification - over 130 kinds have been counted up to now. It is indeed a tapestry, as all the blossoms seem to crowd towards the front, just as in a two-dimensional space.Brueghel's bouquets always build up from relatively small flowers at the bottom to increasingly larger ones at the top, completely against all our current aesthetic 'laws' of compositional gravity. The picture is dominated by a long-stemmed crown imperial, like a real crown. Below are some blue fleurs-de-lis, flanked by white lilies on the left and the red umbel of a peony. The centre is occupied by various kinds of tulips, which were also given special attention by Bosschaert.Furthermore, Brueghel also included strawberries, raspberries and blackberries in his bouquet. This is because, right until modern times, no fundamental difference was made between decorative flowers and other flowers. Strawberries, for example, which blossom and bear fruit at the same time, were therefore generally included among flowers. Strawberry blossoms were regarded as flowers of paradise, as the food of children who had died prematurely and as symbols of the Virgin Mary

06919-b_venus.jpg	The Birth of Venus was exhibited at the Salon of 1863. It is one of the best known examples of 19th century academic painting. The picture was bought by the emperor Napoleon III; there is also a smaller replica (painted in 1875 for a banker, John Wolf) at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.This painting illustrates the kind of technique that was popular at the time: polished, smooth, and meticulous - quite unlike the vigorous work of Manet, who also exhibited at the Salon.

13706-fresco4.jpg	"The Brera has several detached frescoes from the chapel of the Nativit&#224; della Vergine in the Franciscan church of Santa Maria della Pace in Milan. The frescoes depict scenes related to the birth and juvenile years of the Virgin, a subject on which the interest of the Franciscan Order, who played an important role in Lombardy, was focused.In his late frescoes, such as this one, Ferrari appears to have recovered the more spontaneous manner of his early work. The tormented muscular contortions and the forced gestures are simpler here, and the figures appear engaged in quiet, intense conversation. The elements of the composition are densely interwoven, yet there remains a touch of the artist's previous ""stage-set"" painting in the daring oblique perspective and the looming city, with its architectonic definition. It is as if Ferrari were painting an enormous predella in pure, decided colours that create rousing harmonies of pictorial splendour"

07858-07christ.jpg	The quality of Carpaccio's use of colour and his power of expression and invention decreased in his last religious paintings, for the most part executed by his assistants. But in at least two of his late works, where the subject matter stimulated his imagination, Carpaccio returned to the creative levels of his earlier periods.The Dead Christ, which in fullness and richness of colour resembles the 1520 Stoning of St Stephen, is a later version of the Meditation on Christ's Passion in the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and like it it was mentioned in 1623 in the Collection of Roberto Canonici in Ferrara as being by Andrea Mantegna.With the light accentuating the waxy pallor of his flesh, Christ is rigidly stretched out on the shiny marble slab, as though suspended in the foreground of the painting. Against the background of the rocky earth a number of symbols of death all relate to Christ's life on earth and suggest the transience of human life: we see the Virgin, supported by Mary Magdalene in front of St John, a mourning figure with his back to the spectator; St Job in meditation leaning against a tree; graves opened and violated, broken and shattered tombstones, columns and slabs

28779-madonna.jpg	We know very little about Morales. He appears never to have left Spain, and the influence of Italian Mannerism reached him only through the work of Pedro de Campana, an artist of Flemish origin. Virgin and Child is one of his most characteristic pictures, and there are several variants. The composition of the painting may possibly be traced to an engraving by D�rer, but the influence of Italian Mannerism is very strongly felt in the delicate elongation of the neck, the tapering of the fingers, the Leonardo-like softness of the features, the sweet expression reminiscent of Raphael and the use of large blocks of strong colour for the garments. And even if most of Morales's painting does not rise above the average standard achieved by his contemporaries, the variants of Virgin and Child demonstrate an engaging and pleasant handling which justifies the attribute so generally conferred upon him: El Divino, the 'Divine' Morales

31880-y_woman2.jpg	In the late fifteenth century, the brothers Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo ran an active workshop in Florence, producing sculptures, goldsmith work, and painting. There was also a considerable graphic output. By 1450, Antonio was already a renowned goldsmith, and he was also active as a sculptor, in particular of bronzes. Documents refer solely to Piero as the executing artist for certain paintings.The Pollaioulo workshop produced a group of profile portraits of ladies. This group has been the subject of controversy, particularly regarding which work was executed by which brother. Technical and stylistic analysis of the group led to the conclusion that the portraits in Berlin and Milan can be attributed to Antonio, while those in Florence and New York are the works by Piero. The portraits by Antonio are among the most important works of Quattrocento portraiture.The present painting is one of the last profile portraits of a woman, for the type would soon give way to the three-quarter of full face view already common for male portraits. But Antonio delights in the profile, which comes to vibrant life in his hands. His analytic line responds to every nuance of shape as it models her delicate features.There are experts who think it to be the work of Domenico Veneziano. Independently of this uncertainty, this is one of the most beautiful profile portraits of the period

33940-baptism.jpg	Reni's Baptism of Christ, created in the mid 1620s as a major masterpiece of his mature style, is based on principles of composition similar to those applied in The Massacre of the Innocents. The painting is built up into three clearly distinct planes. At the very front, Christ bows beneath the baptismal cup, which John the Baptist pours over him with his raised right hand. The Baptist is standing or, rather, slightly kneeling over Christ on the banks of the Jordan. Below the arc formed by these two figures facing each other in humility, we see two angels who, together with a third figure at the outside left, are holding Christ's robes in readiness. Behind that, the trees, clouds and deep blue sky combine to create a sense of indefinable distance from which the Holy Spirit floats down in the form of a dove.The entire scene, in its structure and colority, is of overwhelming simplicity. The act of baptism itself is entirely void of bright colours. The matt and shimmering flesh tones of the two nude figures stand out clearly against the middle ground and background, where everything is dominated by the solemn purity of the three primary colours red, yellow and blue. On another level, however, all the figures are closely linked in that expression of complete spiritual devotion that Reni could convey like no other artist.Reni was able to create a balance of strictly disciplined compositional form and profound sentiment that his many imitators failed to achieve

00799-perugia3.jpg	St John the Baptist and St Catherine of Alexandria stand at the edge of the step and, like their companion saints in the altarpiece, have a table running behind them. St John's cross is tucked nonchalantly behind his halo and the base of it sticks right forward, but neither this nor his foreshortened hand recreate the impression of three-dimensionality with which he was rendered in the Linaiuoli altarpiece. He holds a scroll with a quotation from his own words, 'Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world', (John 1, v. 29). St Catherine has fewer sculptural qualities still. Beside her is a broken wheel from the diabolical machine on which she was tested. Some critics see the hand of assistants, rather than primarily that of the master, in these two figures

The scene takes place before the backdrop of a city.The saint's father and his retinue take up two thirds of the foreground. On his left arm he carries his son's clothes, in the right he is holding his belt. A narrow space separates him from Francis, who is seen by the observer in a frontal view at prayer. A bishop is covering the saint with his pluvial, which indicates the religious nature of the scene, for it was worn by priests and bishops on ceremonial occasions other than Mass. The contrasting depiction of the father and son expresses the dramatic nature of their conflict, supported by the arrangement of two opposing groups of figures: the secular group is in movement, the religious one frozen. The explanatory inscription reads: QUALITER B. F. CORA(M) EPISCOPO ASISII REN(UNTIA)VIT PATRI HEREDITATEM PATERNAM ET O(M)NIA VESTIMENTA ET FEMORALIA PATRI REIECIT - ""How St Francis renounces his father's inheritance before the bishop of Assisi and his father, and throws his upper garment and hose down before his father."

He failed: the scrupulously detailed representations of the individual figures would not resolve into a unified composition. The time in which David was working was not ripe for the transmutation of a very profane present into a convincing history painting, and the work remained unfinished

19860-1lais_co.jpg	Lais of Corinth was a hetaira in ancient Greece who was famous for her dazzling beauty and her high price. The well-formed, elegantly proportioned beauty of the figure in the panel speaks for itself; the gold coins and the right hand stretched out towards the viewer draw attention to the payment the woman expects for her services. Whether the courtesan is to be equated with the Lais who sat for, and was the lover of, the most noted painter of antiquity, Apelles, is still a matter of speculation.The worldly-wise elegance of pose and expression of this courtesan, combined with the soft and smoky modelling of her features, shows the influence of Venetian painting, which, by the 1520s, was already renowned (and sometimes attacked) for its air of opulent hedonism.Lais - said to have been the mistress of the ancient Greek artist, Apelles - signifies Mercenary Love, it has been thought that a similarly posed figure in a smaller work entitled Venus and Cupid (also in Basel) might be a pendant to this, representing Pure Love. However, although Venetian artists were familiar with the theme of `Sacred and Profane Love' contrasted, as in Titian's great work of that title, no such conclusion seems possible in Holbein's case.As Giorgione's Judith reveals, Holbein's sources were preeminently the sinuous, well-proportioned figures that Leonardo and Raphael had used for their Madonnas (as `perfect' women) but which had taken on other, less spiritual qualities once they reached Venice. Nevertheless, Holbein's adaptation seems to restore some of the earlier Renaissance innocence and Lais's demure expression belies her supposedly brazen costume. The artist shows greater interest in effectively foreshortening the figure's right arm than in presenting a character of easy virtue

32975-08tenda.jpg	Many critics associate the composition of the Madonna della Seggiola (Sedia) with that of the Madonna della Tenda (so called because of the green curtain that has been drawn to one side, and which forms the background) in the Alte Pinakothek of Munich. Here again the Madonna is shown in a three-quarters view with the Child and the young St John. But a relationship exists among the figures which is absent in the Madonna della Sedia. The Virgin smiles at her Child, whose attention is turned toward St John. The face of the latter bears an expression of loving devotion.The authenticity of the painting is no longer in question. What remains controversial is whether it was executed before or after the Madonna della Sedia.By comparing Raphael's mature works to one another, one detects a process of continuous growth, of stylistic evolution. The elements used are always new, as is the pictorial style. But the master's extraordinary capacity to harmonize the composition and the formal beauty of the figures, made more evident by the expression of serene emotion, are unifying motifs

07208-canal411.jpg	Capricci are paintings in which Canaletto drew on his studies of identifiable sites and buildings, but combined them in an imaginative form to create a very consciously fictional and poetic image. Here he has brought together different architectural elements which seem to be both Roman and Paduan in inspiration. The dome on the horizon is reminiscent of that of St Peter's in Rome.Many versions of this composition exist and not all of them can be by Canaletto. The fact that such images were reproduced illustrates that there was a ready market for works of this type. In part they were inspired by the classical landscapes of the seventeenth century, but they also were conceived to appeal to the cult of ruins which developed during the eighteenth century - a trend fed by antiquarianism, archaeology and nostalgia

40758-02icon.jpg	The feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God is the most important feast of the Virgin in the Eastern Church, in spite of the fact that it has no basis in the gospels. The feast and its associated images had their sources in apocryphal stories and homilies, among which a sermon on the death of the Mother of God by Archbishop John of Thessaloniki (610-649) had the greatest influence on the iconographyThe emphasis in the depiction of this event is on the reception of her soul into heaven. Following the end of the Iconoclastic periods, the 10th and 11th centuries witnessed a compositional scheme that was largely retained and later only slightly altered or enriched by the addition of further scenes. The body of the Mother of God is lying stretched out on a bed parallel to the plane of the picture, her legs to the right, as is usual, and her arms crossed over her breast. The apostles, miraculously gathered by angels to the death-bed of the Mother of God from the locations of their respective missions, stand in two groups around the head and foot of the bed. In the centre, behind the bed, we see Christ in a bluish mandorla crowned by a cherub. He is about to entrust to an angel the soul of his mother, represented as a haloed infant in swaddling clothes, which he is holding on his arm

26666-09_7si5.jpg	The Libica, or Libyan Sibyl brings pre-Christian prophecy to a close. With a graceful movement, displaying her lovely shoulders, her foreshortened arms, and the lowered profile of her fine head with its gold tresses, she lays aside the open book as if about to close it. It is a large and cumbersome volume which might well contain all former prophecies. The splendid and superbly gowned figure is extremely colourful; gold tints prevail in her dress lined with salmon pink: the gold of wisdom, the only certain kind of knowledge. Here as elsewhere, one marv�ls at the extraordinary effects obtained with the cold, flat technique of alfresco painting, which had none of the advantages and material possibilities of oil. This figure is that of a noble lady rather than a prophetess, the opposite and counterpart of the gloomy Jeremiah. A faint smile lightens her otherwise remote air

20404-triptych.jpg	The early sixteenth century saw the establishment in Antwerp and Brussels of a new, modish style of Mannerism that broke radically from the serenity that had characterized the previous century. In Bruges, by contrast, a traditional undercurrent survived. The 'Bruges style' was greatly influenced by Gerard David and dominated by two of his pupils, Adriaan Isenbrant (c. 1490-1551) and Ambrosius Benson, both of whom remained active until about 1550. The sfumato technique employed by Isenbrant and the dramatic colour contrasts used by Benson owe much to Italian influence. What is typical about these two painters is the way they grafted their innovations onto old compositional and iconographical schemes, especially those of a religious nature.The triptych represents the Virgin and Child in the centre and Sts John and Jerome on the wings

These works, together with others by Andrea del Sarto, Francesco Granacci, Bachiacca and Franciabigio, were intended for the decoration of the nuptial chamber of Francesco Borgherini and Margherita Acciaioli, who married in 1515. The group of fourteen paintings, broken up at the end of the 16th century, was contained within a wooden decoration made by Baccio d'Agnolo.In the Punishment of the Baker, as in the Joseph Being Sold to Potiphar, the artist uses the arrangement of figures to guide the onlooker's gaze from the foreground towards the background of the painting.

33611-16group.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 417.This family portrait is one of the last pictures painted by Rembrandt. It is undated but must have been made in the last years of his life. It is in his very bold late manner; the paint applied in broad strokes, the surface texture built up with both the brush and palette knife. However, in the faces there is a more careful build-up of layers of paint in which Rembrandt used small brushes to describe the details of the features. There is, as in many of the late works, a concentration upon essentials. The garden setting is indicated in the most rudimentary manner and the mother's skirt is an undifferentiated expanse of warm orange paint.It is interesting to contrast this broad technique with the Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem of 1630, with its thin and sparing application of paint onto panel and details scratched into the wet paint with the end of a brush. The portrait of Agatha Bas is equally controlled and precise but later, as in the Jan Six of 1654 and the Titus of the following year, the paint layers become increasingly thick with form being indicated by single strokes of a loaded brush. The style of The Jewish Bride and of the Family Group is Rembrandt's last manner in which the depiction of form is almost reduced to two dimensions and there is a delight in the patterns of paint on the surface of the canvas. It was this style that Rembrandt's last pupil, Aert de Gelder, was to adopt and continue to employ well into the eighteenth century. Unfortunately the family have not been identified

39244-03camer1.jpg	The works of Tintoretto after the middle of the 16th century demonstrate still more clearly the search for strong sculptural effects achieved by use of chiaroscuro, a complex scenographic spatial representation and the use of clear, bright colour in direct contrast to the more subdued harmonies of Titian's 'magica alchimia cromatica'. The work 'St Jerome and St Andrew' is a major example of these tendencies. It was commissioned for one of the rooms of the Magistrato del Sale in the Palazzo dei Camerlenghi at Rialto by Andrea Dandolo and Girolamo Bernardo, magistrates who left office between September and October 1552.The search for a Manneristic figural rhythm within the overall compositional plan is evident. The figure of St Andrew takes up the whole of the small space to the left of the cross, leaving more room for St Jerome alongside the curvilinear outline of the rock. The scenic effect of the figures constrained in a small space is given unity and the poetic sense of an intense spiritual life by the expressive force of light which brings out all the gradations of colour

12477-06jerome.jpg	St Jerome kneels as a penitent. In his right hand he holds the Bible, which he translated into Latin, and in his left hand the stone which he is using to beat his breast. His eyes stare upwards, beyond the small crucifix stuck into the tree trunk. Wearing a blue gown, his red mantle and cardinal's hat lie beside him on the ground. Behind is his faithful lion, befriended after he had removed a thorn from its paw. In the background is a landscape with dramatic rock formations, probably based on sketches that D�rer had made of the quarries near Nuremberg. The scene is lit by a dramatic evening sky.The reverse of the panel depicts an apocalyptic celestial phenomenon, a red star-like light and a streaking golden disc. Although some scholars have considered it to be an eclipse or meteor, it is almost certainly a comet. D�rer's image is probably derived from woodcuts of comets published in the Nuremberg Chronicle of 1493. A similar object to the one painted by D�rer appears in the sky of his engraving of Melencolia I, made 20 years later

25989-02last1.jpg	On the left, St Peter leads the small band of righteous souls up a crystal staircase to the gates of paradise. Before making their entrance, they are dressed by angels and the attributes of their rank during life are restored: the procession is headed by pope, cardinal and bishop. No racial distinction is made: one black figure appears amongst the righteous and one amongst the damned. The common antithetical symbolism of the new and old dispensations is present here in the shape of a Gothic portal, which conceals two Romanesque towers. Part of this architecture is visible on the extreme right, above the gablet, while red marble columns of the Romanesque type can be glimpsed though the open doorway. Musician angels play on the Gothic balconies. The sculptural scheme of the portal is apocalyptic, with the creation of Eve featuring in the gablet above. The form of the architecture and sculpture thus unites the beginning and end of human history. The construction as a whole represents the New Jerusalem that descends (on the clouds) from heaven (Rev. 3:12).Several of the male redeemed souls have clearly personalised features, as remarked by several authors, suggesting that acquaintances of the donor had their portraits included. That this is indeed the case is supported by the fact that no such figures appear amongst the damned

12497-11elsbet.jpg	Elsbeth Tucher (n�e Pusch) is portrayed against an ornate brocade hanging. At the top of the panel is the inscription, `Elsbeth Niclas Tucher at 26 years 1499'. This is the right wing of a diptych, but the left wing portraying her husband Niclas is missing. Elsbeth holds her wedding ring and the clasp of her blouse is formed with the initials NT, presumably a gift from her husband. The initials WW worked into her blouse and the mysterious letters MHIMNSK on the band over her voluminous headscarf have so far defied interpretation. Just visible on her shoulders is a gold necklace, evidence of her social standing. Above the parapet on the left of the panel is a landscape, with a wood-fringed lake leading to distant mountains, set beneath a stormy sky.D�rer also painted matching portraits of the brother of Niclas, Hans Tucher and his wife Felicitas (n�e Rieter).

33399-01passio.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 548.Rembrandt received a commission from the court in about 1628 through Constantijn Huygens, secretary to the Prince of Orange, for five paintings of the Passion of Christ. The series started with the Raising of the Cross and Descent from the Cross. He was hired to create small versions of Rubens famous altarpieces in Antwerp, the Raising of the Cross and the Descent from the Cross. Huygens asked Rembrandt to produce paintings less than one-twenty-fifth the size of the Rubenses. It must also have been agreed between Huygens and Rembrandt that the artist would inset himself into the composition of the Descent from the Cross as one of the followers of Christ who eased the body to the ground. Originally the Descent from the Cross was intended to be part of a triptych but finally it became one of the five paintings in this series.The two paintings, finished in 1633 are plainly modelled on Rubens's versions of those subjects. When they were delivered in 1633, a new commission followed, for three more paintings of scenes from the Passion of Christ, The Entombment, The Resurrection and The Ascension. The first to be delivered, early in 1636, was The Ascension, the last in iconographic order. If in the Raising and Descent Rembrandt had vied with Rubens, in the Ascension he had moved back in time to the Venetian master Titian. In a composition based on one of Titian's most famous works, the Assumption of the Virgin in the Church of Frari in Venice, Rembrandt created an image of earth, sky, and heaven, with mortals taking leave of a divine creature being raised by angels to the Godhead itself.The reception of the Ascension was not enthusiastic and did not lead to new commissions from The Hague. The final two pieces from the commission of 1633, The Entombment and The Resurrection, were completed in 1639. The series was finally completed only in 1646, with a commission for two other canvases with scenes from the life of Christ as an infant, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Circumcision (now lost, it is known from a copy in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig)

00939-60bosco1.jpg	This altarpiece was painted by Angelico after his return from Rome for the Franciscan convent of Bosco ai Frati in Mugello. It was probably commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici who started the renovation of the convent in 1438. The altarpiece represents the Virgin and Child enthroned with two angels, and Sts Anthony of Padua, Louis of Toulouse and Francis (on the left), as well as Sts Cosmas, Damian and Peter Martyr (on the right).The altarpiece shows further developments of the formula that underlies his earlier sacra conversazione. The architecture is richer and more plastic, so that its articulation of the picture space is partly camouflaged. The throne has been widened and heightened, now looking like the apse of a small church, bringing greater emphasis to the Virgin and Child at the expense of the saints. The wall is enlivened by a series of recessions and projections in the form of niches and half ionic columns. Although the grass and flowers have been excluded from the foreground, the natural world reasserts itself, albeit in a symmetrical composition, behind the wall

26611-03_4sw.jpg	The picture shows the Ignudo at the upper left corner of the Sacrifice of Noah (above the Erythraean Sibyl).The ignudi in the third bay are painted with greater fluency and the modeling is more delicate - with greater attention being paid to the reflections and the subtle effects of light and shade - than those of the first bay. Moreover, their poses are no longer wholly symmetrical. In fact, in the two figures on the left, only the lower part of the body is symmetrical, while the twisting of the bust and the head are expressions of contrapposto. The right arms of both are, however, extended toward the centre in order to hold the ribbon supporting the medallion.

26035-13john3.jpg	The right wing features St John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos.The scenes in the triptych dealing with St John the Evangelist are the following (in chronological order).Memling intended to dedicate the entire right wing to the apocalyptic vision of St John the Evangelist, which meant that there was hardly any space left in the central panel to depict episodes from the life of the saint chronologically. The small scenes are thus shown one above the other, in no particular order.According to his legend, St John was first immersed in boiling oil and then banished to the island of Patmos (we see him embarking on the boat). Upon his return to Ephesus, he raised Drusiana from the dead (first capital), baptised the converted philosopher Crato (in the domed building at the very back) and drank unharmed from the poisoned chalice (second capital). These scenes are given a Roman setting with the Colosseum in the background.The vision of the Revelation or Apocalypse is presented in the right wing with a spatial and dynamic unity that precisely follows the key moments of the text. Banished to the island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea, St John sits with a book on his lap, and dips a pen into an ink-pot, his pen-knife at the ready. He stares upwards, where his visions take shape in the air, on the water and on the adjoining land, in what was for its time a new and unique total spectacle. God appears beneath a stone canopy supported by columns, wearing a red and green robe. He has a greenish glow about his face and hands and is surrounded by a rainbow. Seven lamps burn around the canopy and flames shoot from the rainbow. The twenty-four elders (only thirteen of whom are visible) are seated around the throne wearing golden crowns and dressed in white robes. The throne stands on a crystal surface in which everything is reflected. God is accompanied by four beasts covered with eyes and with six wings: one like a lion, one like an ox, one like a man and one like an eagle. The vision of heaven as a whole is enclosed in a second circular rainbow.The subsequent vision of the Lamb and the sealed book is incorporated in the first. God's right hand rests on a book with seven seals. An angel at the front of the scene points to it and addresses John. A lamb with seven horns and eyes holds the book between its front paws. Memling took another detail - `Each of the elders had a harp. .. and they were singing a new song' (Rev. 5:8-9) - and adjusted it slightly, giving them a variety of musical instruments. The Lamb then breaks six seals, one after the other, causing the four horsemen to appear arid unleashing cosmic disasters. The sequence of the horsemen, each on a little island, reads from left to right: a white rider with a crown on a white horse who looses off an arrow to his rear; a knight in black armour armed with a sword on a light brown horse (the text refers to a red horse); a figure with a long robe on a black horse, carrying a pair of scales; and a pale brown horse ridden by Death, followed by a burning monster's head, in whose mouth human bodies shrivel. Memling did not include the breaking of the fifth seal. The breaking of the sixth seal causes an eclipse of the sun and the stars to fall from the sky. Rich and poor flee into caves. The natural phenomena can be witnessed high above in the sky, while to Death's right we see the figures of a slave, a king and a freeman hiding in rocky crags. When the seventh seal is broken, seven angels are given seven trumpets. Memling included this episode at the top of the circular rainbow. The trumpets are handed out by an arm that emerges from behind a cloud in the topmost corner. Another angel kneels before an altar at the bottom of this mandorla. He spreads incense from a golden censer towards the figure of God. Glowing coals lie on the altar, which he will shortly throw to the earth, causing peals of thunder and earthquakes.Memling also included the following events, each announced by one of the trumpets, in a series of increasingly distant and small scenes: hail and fire rain upon the land, and the grass burns, the burning mountain is hurled into the sea and destroys the ships, and a star falls like a torch from the heavens into the rivers and springs, poisoning them. The latter can be seen on the right-hand edge. A corpse lies alongside a rectangular well. An eagle soars high in the sky. The peninsula to the right features the star with the key of the shaft of the abyss, from which smoke rises and locusts emerge in the form of winged horses with crowned human heads, women's hair, lions' teeth, scorpions' tails and iron breastplates. One of the horses is ridden by a black, demonic figure with the fool's crown. This is Abaddon, the angel of the abyss. A group of cavalrymen wreak death and destruction opposite. The soldiers wear red and grey armour, and ride animals with fire-breathing lions' heads and tails with serpents' heads. They are led by four angels in armour who stand on the bank. Behind them appears a gigantic angel, one foot on the water, the other on the land, his legs like fire, his body wrapped in cloud, his face as yellow as the sun, with a rainbow above his head and a small book in his hand. Memling also followed the biblical text word-for-word for the remainder of the portrayal: the seven thunders are represented as explosions above the angel, who lifts his right arm to heaven to hand over John's book, while the author stands a small distance away, his hands raised. The final scenes relate to the Woman and the Dragon and the creation of the blasphemous Beast. The Virgin Mary appears high in the sky, holding her Child beyond the reach of the red, seven-headed dragon. The latter's tail sweeps the stars from the heavens (the same falling stars from previous disasters in Memling's portrayal). The Dragon is vanquished by Michael to the right, and below pursues Mary, who now has wings. Finally, on the horizon of the sea, the Dragon confers its authority on a seven-headed beast with the body of a leopard that rises from the waters

22635-06annun.jpg	The Annunciation that Lippi painted for the Martelli Chapel in the Medici church of San Lorenzo is among his most gratifying paintings. And as luck would have it, the altarpiece with its fine predella is still in the same place for which it was painted, a majestic space designed by Brunelleschi. Lippi here participates in a strong perspectival exercise, especially in the buildings that recede into the background. But perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the painting, aside from the placement of both Gabriel and Mary on the right half the picture space, is the trompe l'oeil, transparent vase at the bottom, ready to receive the lilies held by the angel. Here Lippi seems to rival the Flemish masters who were experts at rendering nature objectively.The unusual pose that Lippi selected for his Mary Annunciate, with a strong twist of the body, has a parallel in Donatello's high relief Annunciation which the sculptor carved for the Cavalcanti Chapel in Santa Croce. In fact, the relationship of the standing Mary and the kneeling angel is the same in the two representations, although Lippi's style for representing faces is unmistakable and not related to Donatello's classicism of this period

32791-27gravid.jpg	An important aspect of Raphael's Florentine stay is the compositional evolution which his painting underwent. Perugino's compositions - like those of all Quattrocento masters - were based on linear rhythms. In Florence Raphael transformed his compositional type in a constructive-monumental sense. This transformation is recognizable mainly in the human figures, who are still harmonically enclosed in geometric schemes and accompanied by a clear daylight in the background.An example of his ability to resolve natural elements in a synthetic vision which transcends particular situations is the portrait of a woman called La Donna Gravida in the Pitti Gallery, Florence. The subject is a pregnant woman, conscious of her approaching motherhood, who looks intensely toward the spectator, with her hand on her abdomen. The portrait is finely balanced. Solid forms are reduced to pure spherical volumes, overlaid with carefully chosen colours. The sense of colour which this painting shows will be used again by Raphael in his portrait of Cardinal Fedra Inghirami.There are very few examples of portraits of a pregnant woman in Renaissance painting. Raphael shows great sensitivity for the special situation of the mother-to-be by showing both her fragility and her calm pride. Her left hand, resting protectively, gently emphasizes the swell of her stomach, while her gaze rests directly on the onlooker

03566-brutus.jpg	The exact title of the painting: Brutus, Lucretius (father of Lucretia) and Collatinus (her husband) Vow to Avenge her Death and to Drive the Tarquins from Rome.Probably this is one of the paintings, showing unswerving allegiance to one's country or ideals, which influenced Jacques-Louis David when painting The Oath of the Horatii. (David had seen the painting at the 1771 Salon.)In the Brutus story, the oath was sworn as a promise of individual revenge against a corrupt monarchy, and it was somewhat inconsistent and redundant to have noble and virtuous Romans swear an oath to affirm a virtue that was beyond question - patriotism. But the motif of the oath allowed David to present a unified and memorable distillation of a highly involved story

15591-08oldman.jpg	"Ghirlandaio incorporated portraits of his contemporaries in many biblical scenes. It is probably for precisely that reason that he was so popular among the rich Florentines, who were particularly keen on self portrayal. This makes it all the more astonishing that so few secular portraits by Ghirlandaio have survived.There are two paintings dating from about 1490, in the Paris Mus�e du Louvre and in Madrid, that are masterpieces of his art and yet fundamentally different: Giovanna Tornabuoni is idealized to the extent of becoming an ""icon"" of beauty for young Florentine girls, while the old man with the boy is painted with a pitiless degree of realism. Ghirlandaio does not shrink even from depicting his nose in all its disfigurement.In his double portrait in the Mus�e du Louvre, the artist succeeds not only in portraying the two figures with great tenderness, but also in conveying the deep affection between them. The boy is gently snuggling up to the old man. Their eyes meet on a diagonal: this balances the composition, and also excludes the observer from the intimate scene. The boy is looking upwards along the old man's outline, which means that he is actually looking directly at the enormous nose projecting towards him. The contrast makes the little boy's snub nose, and the way his mouth is opened in astonishment, appear all the more childlike. The old man is sitting in the corner of a room in front of an open window The delicacy of the beautiful view of the landscape is, so to speak, a commentary on the profound companionability of the two generations. A soft light is falling an the faces through the window, and the old man is lit from the right and the boy from above. As the lit halves of their faces are turned towards each other, and the same bright red is used for the garments and cap, producing a richness that contrasts with the gray wall behind, the two figures seem to merge to form one. The picture is entirely composed with their unity in mind. Flemish influences are unmistakable in both the choice of the corner of the room and the landscape, bringing to mind both Dirck Bouts' Portrait of a Man in London dating from 1462 and several portraits by Petrus Christus.The identity of the sitters is no longer known, it cannot be stated with certainty whether they are indeed, as is supposed, grandfather and grandson. The man's nose, disfigured by a skin disease called rhinophyma, has in recent years led to the writing of several medical essays. Scratches in the paint layer disfigured it even further. This damage was removed by restoration work carried out in 1996"

19923-09youngm.jpg	The awkwardness of the sitter's pose may result from its being an amalgam of two portraits of other people from about a decade earlier. This may explain the harder, more emphatically linear treatment of clothing and facial modelling, reminiscent of Holbein's style of the early 1530s.The portrait has the static poise and fixity of the miniatures but on a larger scale, which allows scope for the addition of accoutrements. As in the picture of Derich Born (Royal Collection, Windsor), whose frontal gaze is so similar, the questioning directness pierces the viewer's conviction that it is merely a painted image. Although Hilliard's art would have different technical procedures, he wrote in The Arte of Limning (c.1600) of the reputation Holbein gained for the veracity of his work: `(there) came the most excelent Painter and limner Master Haunce Holbean the greatest Master Truly in both thosse arts after the liffe that ever was, so Cunning in both together and the neatest; and therewithall a good inventor, soe compleat for all three, as I never heard of any better than hee.

In the dome of the Cappella della Concezione in the Chiesa dei Francescani in Cortemaggiore, he made it appear as if God the Father and a cloud of angels were plummeting down into the chapel itself through a painted opening in the heavens. Their flight cuts across the fictive architecture and aims for the altarpiece, in which St Anne conceives Mary, who has been miraculously freed of original sin.

05085-presring.jpg	After a phase of admiring study of Titian and Giorgione, Paris Bordone directed his attention first towards the impetuous art of Pordenone and then towards the intimistic narrative strength of the Brescians, to reach during the 1530s a brief period of equilibrium between sumptuousness of colour, inherited from Titian, and the adventurous freedom of composition learnt from the Mannerists. The universally recognized masterpiece of this period is the canvas Bordone painted in 1534 for the Hall of the Albergo in the Scuola Grande di San Marco.The subject of the picture is the second part of a legend which was very dear to Venetians. An old fisherman hands the Doge the ring given him by St. Mark as a proof of the help he gave the saint and two other patron saints of Venice, George and Nicholas, by taking them in his boat to the mouth of the lagoon at the Lido in order that they might make the sign of the cross to sink a boatful of demons that were on their way to threaten Venice with a terrible tempest. The naturalness of the scene, so rich in costumes, portraits and Lombardesque architecture, loses something of its intensity because of the theatrical nature of the architectural setting and because of the rhetorical quality of all the physical and spiritual reactions to the extraordinary event. Thus arises a sort of subtle uneasiness which spreads from the centre stage into the architectural wings of the scene and creates the impression of the rarified atmosphere of an event unrelated to time

13266-2fourmus.jpg	Besides Flemish masters (among them Jacob Jordaens), eight Dutch artists were selected to participate in the decoration of the royal villa - the Huis ten Bosch - at The Hague. All of them were either familiar with classicistic trends or had close contact with Flemish art. Among them, the most attractive and original was Caesar van Everdingen, brother of the landscapist Allaert van Everdingen. The refined, generalized forms, clear outlines, and sensitivity to the effects of light of his Four Muses with Pegasus shows what sets him apart. Everdingen acquired his interest in representing idealized female and male nudes and classical subjects from his connections with artists in Utrecht and Haarlem.The beautiful still-life in the foreground is made up of eleven lifelike musical instruments. From left to right they are a shawm, a vielle, a portative organ, a trombone, a trumpet, a harp, a recorder, a second shawm, a bass gamba, an alto or tenor gamba and a tambourine.This painting is one of the nine large canvases covering the walls in the Oranjezaal in Huis ten Bosch. It is displayed at a height of over five metres above an even larger painting with a high wainscot beneath it

43674-gibralta.jpg	Hendrick Vroom has been rightly called the founder of European marine painting. To be sure, artists before Vroom painted marine pictures but Vroom was the first to specialize in this branch of painting. His pictures, which are usually large and depict historical maritime events, were primarily portraits of ships. Subjects that were a stimulus to patriotism as well as historical naval battles were also portrayed. Vroom's most famous representations of the latter are not paintings but a set of ten tapestries he designed that offered vast bird's-eye panoramas of the Defeat of the Spanish Armada by the English Fleet. The set was completed in 1595, and later hung in the old House of Commons until 1834 when it was destroyed with the building by fire. The tapestries are known today from a fine set of eighteenth-century engravings.

43607-07parnas.jpg	"The painting was part of a series executed for decorations, the other panels (Urania and Calliope; Polyhimnia; Euterpe) are in French and German museums.Apollo Musagetes, the leader of the Muses, fills his role in this painting as a ""kitharodos"" or a singer accompanied by a kithara. He is playing a finely-arched, six-stringed lyre with a very small sound-box, just like the one imagined since the early Renaissance to resemble the instrument of the classical gods. Apollo wears a laurel wreath and, surrounded by the nine Muses, is engrossed in playing his music on Parnassus. The Muses, according to the classical ideal of beauty, are full-figured females; their spiritual substance is expressed by their melancholic expressions. The painter emphasizes the fact that they are related, although each of them can be identified on the basis of small details.There are a number of musical instruments among their attributes: for example, Polyhymnia sits in the right-hand group, facing the viewer, wearing a flowery wreath, holding a papyrus scroll, and resting her right hand on the reverse side of a lute, while in the left rear, embraced by Terpsichore, we can recognize Euterpe, holding a flute in her left hand. The symbols contain the duality of the exalted, laudatory poetry and the sensual, entertaining lyricism. The other Muses are from left to right: Erato, the ""awakener of desire""; Melpomene, the ""singer""; Thalia, the ""ceremonial""; Calliope, the ""fine-voiced""; on the right side, next to Polyhymnia, Urania, the ""heavenly""; and Clio, the ""glorifier"". Of course the original meanings of the Greek names express only part of those qualities which have since been attached to the Muses, who know the secrets of the universe.Simon Vouet's frieze-like painting, intended to be viewed from a low angle, was probably part of a decorative series of panels. Accordingly, its style is characterized by a calculated harmony of colours and forms. It is a fine example of the balanced, Classicist spirit of French Baroque painting"

36871-1reale.jpg	During his fifty-year reign (1680-1730) Vittorio Amadeo II transformed Turin, the second royal residence on Italian soil after Naples, into one of the most splendid Baroque cities in Europe. In 1584 he started the enlargement of the palace known as the Palazzo Reale. The additions to the palace were patterned after the models of French court architecture, but for the wall decorations he looked for Italian painters.The gallery of the east wing served as the official entr�e to the chambers of Vittorio Amadeo II. It was painted by Daniel Seiter, and the room was later named after him. The main subject of the ceiling is the Apotheosis of a Hero (Vittorio Amadeo II). The centre section depicts a theatrically posed young man in the presence of Jupiter, who by presenting him with a golden apple promises a royal future for his family. The young man, though dressed in the manner of a classical hero, is generally thought to represent Vittorio Amadeo II.The centre picture is framed by two tall ovals in which Seiter depicted Apollo in Triumph over Night, and Venus on a Triumphal Chariot. Cartouche-shaped monochromes link the heavy gold frames of the ovals with the border area.With its synthesis of prominent recent Roman precedents, Seiter's ceiling set a new standard for further decorations at the court in Turin

21264-1selfpor.jpg	Two other versions of this picture are known, both of larger dimensions. In Bratislava's Slovensk� n�rodn� gal�ria there is a painting with the signature Kupecky pin 1709, and there was another version, sold in 1902 at a Viennese auction, which has since disappeared and is known only from reproductions.The composition of the three pictures is essentially the same. The Bratislava painting was originally listed in the catalogues as Kupecky's self portrait, and on the basis of an engraved copy of the young Kupecky's self-portrait, made by Johann Gottfried Saiter and Johann Jacob Haid, this attribution seems acceptable: the shape of the face, the mouth and the chin show a clear similarity.

As Richard Cocke has explained, however, it could be Thalia, who in conjunction with the eight muses of the transept and the gods of the sky illustrates the real theme of the dome fresco, i.e. the harmony of the spheres.

33334-1dibutad.jpg	"In the last decades of the eighteenth century there was a widespread vogue for paintings that evoked the origins of art. Instead of the usual allegories or emblematic paintings of tools of the trade, two anecdotal subjects were often handled: ""Dibutades Tracing the Portrait of a Shepherd"" (the supposed origin of painting) and ""Pygmalion and Galatea"" (sculpture). In both cases, love was at the heart of the work. The former subject, extraordinarily popular during the last third of the century, concerned the legend of a young woman from Corinth, who outlined the shadow cast on a wall by her beloved. It was held to be a valid illustration of the origins of art, combined with the amorous motivation required by that sentimental age. The anecdote was cited in art manuals as early as 1760, and was familiar to every studio.Regnault used to theme for an overdoor in the queen's Grand Cabinet at Versailles, at the same time painting a Pygmalion for her bedchamber. There are numerous examples of this subject   up to about 1820, culminating with Fuseli and Girodet"

05461-30magnif.jpg	"Botticelli created his Madonna del Magnificat in the early 1480s. At the time, it was in all likelihood his most famous picture of the Virgin, something indicated by the five contemporary replicas which we have of the painting.The painting was lavishly covered with gold paint; like the Raczynski Tondo, it contains nearly life-size figures. The Virgin, crowned by two angels, is depicted as the Queen of Heaven. Two of the wingless angels are crowning the Queen of Heaven. The crown she is wearing is a delicate piece of goldsmiths work consisting of innumerable stars; they are an allusion to the 'Stella matutina' (morning star), one of the Mother of God's names in contemporary hymns devoted to Mary.There is such a complex solution to the sequence of crowded figures in front of the stone window that it is possible to look out between Mary and the angels on the left onto a broad landscape laid out according to the rules of atmospheric perspective. The three angels have moved towards the Virgin and Child. The one at the front is kneeling and holding an open book and inkwell. Encouraged by the Christ Child, the Virgin is about to dip her quill and write the last words of the Magnificat, beginning on the right page with the large initial ""M"". The pomegranate which the mother and child are both holding is a symbol of the Passion and adds to the basic melancholy and meditative mood of the painting.The background of the picture opens out into a landscape, in similar manner to the background in the Madonna del Libra where the open window allows the observer a glimpse of the view outside. These landscapes point to the influence exerted upon Botticelli by contemporary Netherlands' artists such as Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden and Hubert van der Goes. Trading relations between Italy and the Netherlands had been growing more intensive since the 15th century, resulting in many Florentine merchants and bankers travelling northwards. Among the mementos which these people brought back were paintings revealing other artistic conceptions and ideals. The Italian painters particularly admired the detailed execution of individual pictorial motifs, the realistic fashioning of the figures in the pictures, and the atmospheric effect of the landscapes as rendered in the art of their colleagues north of the Alps, and each incorporated the motifs of the latter into his own pictures after his own manner.This portrait of the Virgin represents the costliest tondo that Botticelli ever created: in no other painting did he employ so much gold as in this one, using it for the ornamentation of the robes, for the divine rays, and for Mary's crown, and even utilizing it to heighten the hair colour of Mary and the angels.

34243-l_river.jpg	"This picture, restored in 1965, is the counterpart of the painting Landscape with Watering Horses. Both are fairly well-known works, dating from about 1720. In the background of the latter the valley of the River Piave is depicted. Generally, this picture is considered to be one of Marco Ricci's masterpieces.The artist had a harassed life of hardship trailing off to a sad end, if the chroniclers &#151; rather than the critics &#151; are to be believed. Apprenticed to his uncle Sebastiano, he savoured the ferment of new stirrings in the world of Venetian art. It brought forth in him a narrative streak in what was just then fairly taking over the Venetian art scene&#151;landscape painting. Drinking in the Flemish Tempesta's landscapes, Magnasco's vibrant artistry, all that he saw and assimilated on his frequent travels alone and with his uncle he converted, in an intense and many-sided creative zeal, into forms all his own. Pallucchini and Valcanover (1951, 1955) admit ""the difficulty, to this day, of reconstructing Marco Ricci's art, in view of the total lack of data"". Though Goering's chronology had been lengthy and cumbersome enough, Ivanoff (Emporium, 1948) included in it this picture, too, for he considered it the beginning of a trend leading from the chiaroscuro style of the Baroque towards the colourful light effects of the eighteenth century. Later, in 1957, Pallucchini stated that these light effects were inevitable in view of Ricci's links with the countryside.The historian Zanetti mentioned that like a ""pilgrim"", Ricci used to return to the region of Belluno, where he found ideas for his painting and matured his new techniques. The picture itself portrays the sense of the place by the unbroken, atmospheric flow of light, which makes the chiaroscuro verticals of the group of trees even more striking. This new susceptibility was nothing more than a novel approach to reality, which sprung out of the shadow of the rhetoric which had preceded it. It almost seems as if the light itself enjoyed setting off the figures in the foreground while harmonically inundating the background. Yes, here lies a new pictorial approach"

23801-2spanis4.jpg	When Napoleon III married a Spanish bride, the resulting wave of 'espagnolisme' found in Manet a willing adept. This was the fashion, and Manet wanted to be a man of his time. However, despite his best efforts, his painting gave rise to successive scandals.Two people had played a decisive role in the development of Manet's Spanish period, which reached its culmination around 1862. First and foremost was a professional model, Victorine Meurent, who entered Manet's life and work simultaneously, successively becoming the model of the present painting, and the nudes of D�jeuner sur l'herbe and Olympia. She was perfectly suited to modeling the unconventional feminine protagonists for whom Manet liked to set the scene.

St Romuald (c. 950-1027) was the founder of the austere Camaldolese order - and offshoot of the Benedictines - so called from the monastery he established at Camaldoli, a mountainous place near Arezzo in Italy, of which he holds a model in his hand.In the painting the ideal monastic settlement is depicted: we see individual hermitages or cells, each with their own garden, built around a central chapel  with a common building and fountain near the entrance gate.

32786-25drago1.jpg	The St Michael and St George and the Dragon in the Louvre, and the St George of the National Gallery in Washington are bound together both by their subject - an armed youth fighting a dragon - and by stylistic elements. All three are assigned to the Florentine period and echo those stimuli which Raphael received from the great masters who worked in Florence or whose paintings were visible there. The influence of Leonardo - whose fighting warriors from the Battle of Anghiari (1505) in the Palazzo della Signoria provided an extraordinary example of martial art (the painting deteriorated very rapidly because of shortcomings in Leonardo's experimental technique and so is no longer visible) - predominates in these works. But references to Flemish painting - particularly that of Hieronymus Bosch (the glaring light and humanoid monsters which populate the St Michael are characteristic of Bosch) - suggest the environment of Urbino, where Northern influences were still quite vivid.These small panels are indicative of a moment in which the painter gathers the stylistic fruits of what he has assimilated so far and, at the same time, poses pictorial problems which will be developed in the future

17197-cypres08.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 675, JH 1921.Motifs such as wheatfields and times of the day had been part of the vocabulary of van Gogh's art in his formative Dutch years. The important feature of his programme in Saint-R�my was his return to the preoccupations of that period and their justifications. He wrote to ask his family to send him drawings made in Nuenen so that he could rework them and work on similar themes.He began a series of paintings of imaginary landscapes, based in part on sketches he had made in Drenthe and Nuenen and in part on his recollections of the rural architecture and the agricultural labourers of Brabant, which he called Memories of the North or Memories of Brabant. These drawings and paintings were not mere imitations of past work. Through them van Gogh was asserting his allegiance to the ideas and meanings that such subjects, painted by himself and an earlier generation of French and Dutch artists, had carried - expressions of an attitude to the modern world. So he revived that subject-matter but revised it in terms of colour, and in drawing used the more sinuous, flowing and decorative graphic style that he had been developing in Saint-R�my

The extraordinary size of the room, which is suggested by the marble fireplace and the seascape above it, exceeds what would have been found in almost any private house in a Dutch city during the period. The model for the main features of the room: the fireplace and the black-and-white marble floor are derived from the burgomasters' council chamber in the new Town Hall (now the Royal Palace ) of Amsterdam, designed by Jacob van Campen. Pieter de Hooch depicts the same room in a painting now in Madrid.

03384-stillif.jpg	This painting is one of the most successful examples of Baschenis's lifetime pursuit: the painting of still-lifes of musical instruments. It shows the artist's unflagging attention to the forms of his subjects, which are geometrical and capricious at the same time. The instruments are studied under a light that reveals their inner poetry but leaves their age-old shape and substance intact. Lovingly selected, these mandolins and horns are seen in terms of a strict construction of shadowed tones, broken only occasionally by a lighter passage. Their arrangement suggests an illusory, unchanging fixity, as if a symphony had been transposed from sound into three-dimensional composition, after the music had stopped.The instruments represented are a clarinet, a mandolin, a double-bass bow and - on the crest - a recorder.

18755-guard297.jpg	Ever since the early sixteenth century the view of Piazza San Marco has been partly determined by the Torre dell'Orologio, the construction of which was largely completed in 1506. Francesco Guardi represented the building here with the two storeys added to the wings in 1755. To the left of this is part of the Procuratie Vecchie, which at that time accommodated the procurators of San Marco, the most important representative magistracy after the Doge; on the right is the Basilica itself. It is striking that the square does not display the geometrical patterns of the paving which was laid in about 1723.Guardi recorded the view from a vantage point beyond the Campanile, though he adapted the result of his observations somewhat for the sake of the composition. By placing the walls of the Procuratie and the Torre parallel to the picture plane, the angle between these structures and the fa�ade of San Marco appear greater than in reality. This also has the effect of making the square much more spacious. There are also several details which do not entirely correspond with the actual situation, such as the three flagstaffs, which have been depicted lower and thinner than in actuality. A drawing by Guardi has been preserved that is virtually identical in terms of detail to the painting.Despite the prominent place of the Torre dell'Orologio it was seldom chosen as an independent motif by the Venetian vedutisti. Carlevaris and Canaletto did include it in paintings, but only as an incidental feature, and furthermore from a different angle. Francesco Guardi painted this theme at least eight times, always from virtually the same vantage point. Each time he gave a slightly different impression of the space by varying the relationships, the light and the positioning of the figures. In this painting the foreground is almost empty and the depth is only accentuated by the strikingly foreshortened fa�ade of San Marco and the lines of the three flagstaffs running parallel to it, and by the tents fluttering fitfully in the wind. In this simple composition Guardi emphasized the play of light and colour on the walls and the pavement

29216-01nunzia.jpg	The original Baroque church of the Jesuits was built in 1588. At the beginning of the eighteenth century it underwent a complete modernization, including the building of a new church. This longitudinal structure, begun in 1713 after a design by Arcangelo Guglielmelli, was provided with opulent interior decoration under the direction of the painter and architect Ferdinando Sanfelice (1675-1748). The frescoes in the apse were executed by Francesco de Mura. The unified and splendid nature of the decor is considered to be the most imposing example in Naples of the transition between the Baroque and the Rococo.After the suppression of the Jesuit order the complex around the church became the Royal Military College (Scuola Militare Nunziatella) and the church became the chapel of military institute. Originally the church was dedicated to the Virgin of the Annunciation, but it is popularly known as the Nunziatella to distinguish it from the Basilica of Santissima Annunziata Maggiore. Francesco de Mura began painting the apse calotte in the Nunziatella in 1731 which he completed next year. He began the second phase in the fresco painting of the Nunziatella in 1749, one that had been envisioned since 1726. In this phase he painted the vault.The iconographic concept on which the decoration is based is distinctly Jesuit in character. In the apse calotte the Adoration of the Kings, on the nave vault the Assumption of the Virgin are represented. In the half-lunettes flanking the fa�ade-wall window appear the Rest on the Flight into Egypt and The Holy Family at Work

20416-5waterin.jpg	"In ""Watering"", a harmonious union of  man and landscape is expressed which was a fundamental experience of artists of the Nagyb�nya school. Iv�nyi prepared a small sketch with a much narrower angle for it, thus the rider's figure dominates it. He creates a balance of dark and light patches, i.e. patches of sunshine and shadow. The huge dark green crown of trees dominating the picture, the blackish shadow of trees and horses, the waistcoat of the rider and the dark brown patch of water in the ravine counterpoise details in the sunshine.

40800-001chris.jpg	The earliest surviving examples of Spanish panel paintings are the altar panels produced by painters active in the workshops attached to religious houses. These panels were intended for the decoration of altars and the choice of theme was confined to the symbolic representation of figures from the New Testament. Scenes from the lives of saints were but rarely depicted. In practically every one of these panels we find centrally placed in the composition the figure of the Virgin or of Christ, surrounded by a round or oval halo. Round the central figure are narrative scenes or a hieratic arrangement of the apostles.This panel, now in Barcelona, is a typical example of such a retable. Its painter is referred to as the Master of Seo de Urgell. There are innumerable contemporary miniatures in which the faces and the drapery of the garments have been painted in a similarly stereotyped manner. Every single figure is schematic: the apostles stand stiffly upright, each one holding some object by which he can be identified - and yet the artist has breathed life into these figures. Christ, judging the world, places his hand on a book with the very gesture that might be used by a student of the law as he closes the codex in which he has sought guidance in reaching a fair jjudgment. At the same time there is in the iconography all the naivete of folk-art: the detail and ornamental elements convey the painter's delight in unrestricted decoration

33646-05landsc.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 441.Rembrandt began painting landscapes after the middle of the 1630s. His work in this important branch of Dutch painting is a very small part of his oeuvre. Today less than ten are attributable to him. But we know he must have painted at least a few more. His 1656 inventory lists eleven, some of which are not identical with those that have survived. His other existing painted landscapes belong to a different category. They are imaginary panoramic views of broad valleys and mountain ranges, gigantic trees, fantastic buildings and ruins in which the influence of Hercules Seger is obvious. Characteristic of them is this Stormy Landscape.In this dramatic view with deep emotional overtones, threatening storm clouds, pierced by bursts of warm sunlight, fill the land with darkness. Here Rembrandt imposes his brilliant Baroque imagination upon nature. The drama of the chiaroscuro does not describe meteorological conditions, but embodies Rembrandt's reaction to the mysterious forces of the sky and the earth. Something of Rubens's exuberant response to nature can be felt, but Rembrandt's landscapes are always more mysterious and less colourful than those of the Flemish master. The colour remains fairly subdued, with a few brilliant contrasts of golden yellow and browns against greens, pinks, and greys

13366-l3adora.jpg	The central panel of the lower tier portrays the saints symbolizing the eight Beatitudes gathered round the altar where the sacrifice of the Lamb is taking place, at the centre of the heavenly garden which has sprung from His blood.To left and right, in the foreground, are two processions facing one another. One of these is made up of the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, and the other of figures from the New Testament. Some of them are kneeling, barefoot. Behind them is assembled the hierarchy of the Church - popes, deacons and bishops, wearing sumptuous jewelry and clothes in the bright red of martyrdom.In the background are two further groups, facing each other as if they had just emerged from the surrounding shrubbery. These are, on one side, the Confessors of the Faith, tightly packed together and almost all dressed in blue; and on the other side, the Virgin Martyrs, holding out palm fronds and wearing in their hair crowns of flowers of a kind traditionally worn by young girls at certain holy ceremonies.In the middle of the panel, around the altar where the Lamb spills forth his blood, angels kneel, holding the emblems of His Passion. Grace is symbolized by a radiant dove hovering in the sky, and eternal life is represented by a fountain in the foreground. A paradisiacal landscape runs across all five lower panels, uniting them in a single composition. It is strewn with plants from different countries and flowers of different seasons. The central panel is vibrant with green, while those to the sides are more arid and rocky. The horizon sits high in the frame and is closed off by groves of trees, behind which clusters of fairy-tale buildings can be made out, representing the heavenly Jerusalem

24592-st_anne2.jpg	Massys's first dated work is the Holy Kinship, also known as The St Anne Altarpiece, now in Brussels. This triptych dates from 1507-1508, and was commissioned by the Confraternity of St Anne for their chapel in St Peter's church in Leuven. It is visibly the work of an experienced artist.The central panel shows the Virgin, the Holy Child and St Anne, with Mary the mother of James and Mary Salome sitting in the foreground with their children. Further back, there are four men standing behind the central figures, and behind them is an architectural fantasy in the Italian style, executed in trompe-l'oeil. The overall effect is of a portrait of a rich, dignified middle-class family, with its severe patriarchs and its amiable and graceful women - a family such as one might meet among the newly-wealthy classes that had begun to proliferate in Antwerp, thanks to the development of the port, which in those days had recently established itself as the first in Europe

36650-family.jpg	Kremser Schmidt's authentic portraits and the documents of his life unanimously prove this picture to represent the painter Schmidt with his family. The master is sitting in the foreground at his easel, with a brush in his right hand, in comfortable indoor clothes. In front of him can be seen his wife and their daughter. The painter is turning right, towards his two sons. The younger son, the painter Johann Karl Martin is holding a palette and a portrait of the deceased members of the family. The elder brother, Joseph Johann, whose head is painted on a canvas inserted subsequently in the painting, is sitting at right in the foreground, with a document in his hand. In the background a large painting is represented, Venus in the Workshop of Vulcanus, a lost work of Schmidt.This family portrait is known to us in other versions. A larger variation in a Frohnleiten private collection, painted on copper (72,4 x 86,4 cm) includes the signature of Schmidt and the date 1790. Another version from Sternberk Castle Museum (Bohemia, today in Olomouc Krajsk� vlastv�dn� muzeum) shows only a fragmentany detail of the larger portrait with the self portrait of the painter.

09664-1stufa2.jpg	In 1637, on his way from Rome to Bologna, Pietro da Cortona sojourned for some time in Florence to paint the decorations in the Sala della Stufa (Room of Stove) in the Palazzo Pitti on behest of Grand Duke Ferdinando II. The four walls of the room , which took its name from the heating pipes it once housed for the nearby bedrooms, are painted with scenes of the Four Ages, a subject taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. The ensemble, planned as a whole but executed during two separate working phases in 1637 and 1641, represents one of the artist's true masterpieces.

09561-corot151.jpg	The Barbizon School played an outstanding role in the history of modern landscape painting. This was a group of young artists who in the 1830s and 40s sought the beauties of the unsullied landscape, a rural idyll, the un dramatic yet inspirited 'paysage intime' in the forest of Fontainebleau. They finally settled in the village of Barbizon, where they were occasionally joined by Camille Corot, the major artist of the group.Corot's works embody the essence of a landscape painting of airily rendered, basically ordinary scenes populated now and then with mythological figures. These were alternative images to an economically and touristically exploited nature. Inspiration came from seventeenth-century Dutch landscapes and those of the Englishman John Constable, but especially from the new turn to open-air painting and its capturing of atmospheric, evanescent effects. This notwithstanding, Corot generally finished his works in the studio. Using a limited range of colour, especially earthy greens, a silvery gray, ocher and their gradations, contrasted with a bright sky, Corot engendered a lovely, melodious harmony that clothed nature in a Late Romantic, magical mood.In The Solitude, the artist has done without all mythological trappings. A female figure, reclining and as if lost in thought, is sufficient to lend this, one of the Barbizon master's most elegiac landscapes, an incomparable mood of loneliness and yearning

04712-calvary.jpg	Herri met de Bles was a significant contributor to the tradition of landscape painting. One of his largest landscapes appears as the setting for the Road to Calvary, now in Princeton. The subject is immersed within a spectacular landscape. The foreground procession of people who stream from the giant turreted gate of Jerusalem is minuscule, and within the city walls  the artist scatters more tiny figures, who act out the various episodes of the Passion.In contrast to the procedure of the early landscapists, met de Bles's procedure was first to sketch the layout of the landscape omitting figures entirely, to assure a unity and totality to the view. The figures were added later. In this painting, like in his other landscapes, the painter thought in terms of a landscape with figures and not figures in a landscape

07427-saluting.jpg	Cappelle belongs to the generation of Ruisdael and Cuyp. His compositions, like theirs, gain strength and monumentality by the union of tectonic and dynamic features and are classic in their perfection. He calms the agitated seas painted by Porcellis and young Simon de Vlieger.Few of Cappelle's marines are sea paintings in the strict sense of the word: most of them represent the mouth of wide rivers or quiet inner harbours, where groups of ships parade or lie at anchor in mirror-smooth waters. Masts make a pattern of verticals which is coordinated with the horizontals of hulls and the low horizon. The haze found in works by earlier marine painters lifts, and the middle distance acquires more real existence between the foreground forms and the minute details of the far distance. Space opens up widely, yet the design is well-balanced and maintains a powerful coherence as a whole.Essential qualities of van de Cappelle are his full cloud formations, the wonderful transparency of his shadows, and the subtlety of his colourful reflections in calm waters. Early morning or evening are his favourite hours. He was not a man to paint sea battles. His is a holiday mood: cannons salute, drums roll, pennants flutter, and noble personages ride in richly carved, gilded barge. Not many of his works are dated, but it is reasonable to assume that his simple compositions done in silvery greys, which recall Porcellis and de Vlieger, belong to an early phase, and the more complex, colourful works with a golden tonality were done after 1650.He also painted some beach scenes and more than forty winter landscapes. These, like his marines, render nature with a wonderful feeling for the pictorial qualities of Holland's sea atmosphere, with its heavy clouds and translucent air

37518-8sabinew.jpg	This painting is variously dated to between 1501 and 1515 and to 1506-07 on account of the stylistic similarities to other works of the artist from this same moment. The subject of the painting is based on Plutarch's narrative of the rape of the Sabine women. The painting was once, however, identified as the Story of Rhea Silvia.The complex iconography treats the narrative of abduction through the selection of the moment when Ersilia is brought to Romulus, to whom she is destined to be paired.

19363-1hayez.jpg	"This youthful work was to some extent still rooted in Venetian art of the late eighteenth century but also reveals Canova's influence. Hayez created a splendid effect in the way the light filters through the green of the garden of the seductive enchantress. He also showed virtuoso talent in the way the light reflects in the circular shield that glitters in the foreground.The theme is taken from Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata (""Jerusalem Delivered""). Armida is the enchantress who holds Rinaldo under her spell in a magical palace that is an illusion. Without him, affairs are going badly for the crusaders. The pastoral idyll, Armida's hate for the crusaders turned to love for one Crusader, and the call of duty that leaves Armida abandoned, all appealed to Baroque and Rococo artists. George Frideric Handel composed an opera using a libretto written by Giacomo Rossi, based on episodes of Gerusalemme liberata."

19612-saints.jpg	These fragmentary panels showing the standing figures of Sts George and Sebastian. A indicated by the fragments of arches below, the saints must originally have belonged to the top half of a panel consisting four figures, which probably formed the right wing of a folding triptych. Presumably a complementary arrangement was present on the lost left wing. The original eight standing figures (four at left, four at right) was probably located  on the wing exteriors, visible in the closed state of the triptych.Formerly attributed to Friedrich Herlin, the panels now are thought were executed by an anonymous painter in the circle of Friedrich Herlin. The facial types in the panels show strong similarity to those of Herlin and his workshop. The long cylindrical noses with pinched nostrils, heavy lidded eyes, reddened cheeks, and strong gray shadows are typical, as is the prominent triangular shadow at the temple of the Sebastian figure. Similar faces appear throughout the N�rdlingen and Rothenburg high altarpieces of 1462 and 1466, as well as in Herlin's 1468 Genger Epitaph, which also shows comparable architectural forms

32068-cremona7.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. He painted the scenes above the next arch, and continued the cycle on the right wall, where he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.Romanino was commissioned for the next four scenes of the Passion on the right wall. In December 1519 he was commissioned to fresco the three remaining bays of the nave as well. However, the contract was revoked in 1520 and it was awarded to Pordenone. Above each arch there is just one broad field in which he painted Pilate Judges Christ; Carrying the Cross; Christ Nailed to the Cross. In each composition an immense, dense, violent jostling of figures is developed in a relief-like style and from a viewpoint slightly below the action.The narrative folds into the wall of the fa�ade, where the trilogy of the procession to Calvary comes to a close in the enormous fresco of the Golgotha by Pordenone

19974-1solomon.jpg	The encounter of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, who has arrived from the East with a large retinue to pay homage to the wise king and bring gifts, is described in the Old Testament. The subject matter is made explicit by the words REGINA SABA written quite clearly in the foreground. In iconographical tradition, the Queen of Sheba is often taken to represent the Church, and Solomon to represent Christ, to whom the Church pays homage.This delicate and elegantly constructed group of courtly figures clearly alludes to Henry VIII, in the swaggering pose of the seated, bearded king, while the architecture is reminiscent of that in the Whitehall painting. Henry VIII was known to consider himself a Solomonic figure, an identification which allowed him to take over the spiritual guidance of the state after 1536 with a modicum of conscience. The Queen of Sheba herself symbolizes the Church's new subservience to the Crown, made explicit by the altered quotation, from II Chronicles 10, v7-8, which adorns the scene.It is difficult to date the work but it has been suggested that, like the Washington portrait of Edward, Prince of Wales, it was a presentation work for the court for New Year's Day, 1540. Its small size is also unusual in Holbein's oeuvre; the intricate working of pen and brush watercolour, bodycolour and gold paint; particularly in the architectural detailing, belongs as much to old-fashioned Tudor gothic as to contemporary mannerism.

29913-countryp.jpg	The grotesque peasants carousing, brawling, or engaged in swinish gluttony in disorderly hovels are characteristic of Ostade's boisterous work of his early phase. In the 1640s his interiors gain in spaciousness and atmosphere. By the middle of the century Ostade had changed to a more idyllic style. His figures became calmer and more respectable. There is a new emphasis on local colour and an orderly arrangement. The reason for the shift in Ostade's mood has not been established. Perhaps it is related to a change in his clientele, to his own conception of himself, and his ideas about his task as an artist.

32345-13ignazi.jpg	During the construction of the church of Sant'Ignazio, there was a dispute with the Dominicans of Santa Maria sopra Minerva who objected the planned cupola because it would have stolen light from their library. It was recommended by the architect Mattia de'Rossi, that the cupola problem could be resolved by having one painted instead of actually built. The architecture painter and Jesuit lay brother Andrea Pozzo was selected for the commission, which was completed in 1685.That one of the most venerable architectural features of Roman church architecture could be replaced by a painting was something as spectacular as it was symptomatic. By means of perspective, Pozzo had managed to triumph over architecture with the arsenal of painting. The simulated cupola, as an alternative to actual constructed architecture, was born of necessity, but it demonstrated both that painting could not only replace architecture in ephemeral festival settings and that permanent theatrical effects were permissible in a sacred space

26562-03_2ce3f.jpg	The seventh scene in the chronological order of the narrative, the Sacrifice of Noah, is depicted in the centre of the vault of the third bay, between two pairs of ignudi with medallions.In the central panel, the composition of which is derived from those of classical reliefs, Noah celebrates the sacrifice on an altar seen cornerways on, assisted by other figures. In the chronological sequence of the biblical narration, the Sacrifice ought to follow and not precede the Deluge, but, apart from considerations relating to the typological interpretation of the scene, it is possible that Michelangelo preferred to reserve one of the largest panels in the ceiling for the Deluge.The ignudi are painted with greater fluency and the modeling is more delicate than those of the first bay. Moreover, their poses are no longer wholly symmetrical. In fact, in the two figures on the left, only the lower part of the body is symmetrical, while the twisting of the bust and the head are expressions of contrapposto. The right arms of both are, however, extended toward the centre in order to hold the ribbon supporting the medallion. On the other hand, the ignudi on the right lean out toward the exterior, and the only difference between them appears to be the position of their arms.In the medallions, the Destruction of the Statue of the God Baal and the Killing of Uriah are depicted

21386-lycomed1.jpg	This subject is rare in seventeenth-century Northern Netherlandish art. However, it became extremely popular in Flanders after Rubens' version appeared in c. 1616. There are three known versions of the theme by Lairesse: in the Mauritshuis, The Hague, in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, and in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig.The subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Knowing her son was destined to die if he went to fight in the Trojan war, Thethis, a sea nymph, disguised Achilles as a woman and entrusted him to King Lycomedes, in whose palace on the isle of Scyros he lived among the king's daughters. Odysseus and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch Achilles. They cunningly laid a heap of gifts before the girls - jewellery, clothes and other finery, but among them a sword, spear and shield. When a trumpet was sounded, Achilles instinctively snatched up the weapons and thus betrayed his identity.Lairesse, like all other artists who rendered the subject, chose the scene Achilles examining the weapons

43915-edward3.jpg	The American artist, Benjamin West, arrived in England in 1763, after spending three years in Italy. He quickly gained the patronage of George III, for whom he became Historical Painter in 1772 carrying out a number of projects, especially at Windsor Castle, involving classical, historical and religious subjects. West was a founding member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1768 and succeeded Sir Joshua Reynolds as President in 1792.A series of eight paintings illustrating events from the reign of Edward III was commissioned from West by George III to decorate the Audience Chamber at Windsor Castle. The task took three years to complete from 1786 to 1789, but the arrangement was dismantled by George IV during the mid-1820s when much of Windsor Castle was redesigned by Jeffry Wyatville. However, a view of the Audience Chamber with the pictures still in place is included in W. H. Pyne's The History of the Royal Residences of 1819. The present painting was double-hung on the left of the throne balancing The Burghers of Calais on the right, positioned above the door.The series illustrates Edward III's campaign in northern France during the summer of 1346. Edward III crossing the Somme is the first in the sequence and shows an incident preceding the Battle of Cr�cy, when the king was trying to cross the River Somme at Blanche Tache, near Abbeville, in order to escape the French army. Edward III encountered and engaged a part of the French force under Godemar de Faye, the outcome of which, like the Battle of Cr�cy itself, was dependent upon the skill of the English archers seen in the upper right of the composition. The king is on horseback just to the right of centre and the figures accompanying him can be identified with the aid of a key provided by the artist for George III. An oil sketch of the composition is in the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, California.A subject taken from medieval history was an unusual choice for this date. According to West's earliest biographer, John Galt, it was George III who, 'recollecting that Windsor Castle had, in its present form, been created by Edward the Third, said, that he thought the achievements of his splendid reign were well calculated for pictures, and would prove very suitable ornaments to the halls and chambers of that venerable edifice.' In addition to his military prowess, Edward III had also been the founder of the Order of the Garter that is so closely associated with Windsor Castle. The paintings by West must be seen, therefore, as part of a revival of interest in the Middle Ages that was being pioneered by antiquarians such as Joseph Struttz and Francis Grose, to whose works the artist clearly referred for details of the arms, armour, and dress. For the historical narrative the primary sources in English were an early translation of the Chronicles (1325-1400) of Jean Froissart and the History of England (1754-62) by David Hume. West's work showed that ideal truth could be sought in themes unrelated to antiquity, and his lively treatment of such subject matter reveals his innovative qualities as an artist

16040-franc15.jpg	This is the fifteenth of the twenty-eight scenes (twenty-five of which were painted by Giotto) of the Legend of Saint Francis.The two scenes on the entrance wall are the Miracle of the Spring and the Sermon to the Birds, the compositions in which the hand of Giotto is most apparent.St. Francis came across a flock of birds that did not fly away at his approach. He gave a sermon to the expectantly waiting creatures, who only left the saint after receiving his blessing. As so often, Giotto makes plain the extraordinary nature of events through the reaction of a secondary figure - in this case, through the Franciscan friar, who raises his hand with a surprised expression on his face.

07988-landscap.jpg	This composition is known in two versions: the one from Boston and another in tempera in the Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence. While both clearly belong to the Carracci circle, their precise authorship has been the subject of debate. First attributed to Agostino Carracci then to Sisto Badalocchio, the tempera in Florence is now given to Agostino's son Antonio. The version in Boston is considered to be by Badalocchio or perhaps by Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi. However, apart from the variation in the colour scheme due to the different media, the two canvases are identical. They must, therefore, be by the same painter, in all likelihood Antonio Carracci.The two nudes at the centre of the composition are derived from Michelangelo's Battle of Cascina and are almost indistinguishable from those in a fresco of The Flood in the so-called Stanza del Diluvio in the Palazzo del Quirinale painted by Antonio Carracci in 1616. In a canvas version of the fresco (Mus�e du Louvre, Paris), there is also a rocky ledge very similar to the central one in the Landscape with Bathers. If no further precise analogies can be drawn with other documented landscapes by Antonio, it is well to keep in mind that they are all in fresco and were often repainted in the nineteenth century. The subject, which is unthinkable without Domenichino's precedents, remains rather obscure: a fully dressed woman, next to a picnic basket, directs the viewer's attention to a clothed man in the middle ground, while the Herculean efforts of the two nude bathers on a small promontory at the centre seem unjustified by the occasion

06455-02adorat.jpg	Despite specialising in scenes from peasant life, for which he became known as 'Peasant Bruegel', the artist was no Flemish rustic but a highly educated man who travelled to Italy recording views of cities and landscapes. He began his career working for a publisher designing popular satirical engravings and prints after Bosch. When he began to paint around 1560 he found his patrons among the leading intellectuals and rich bankers of Antwerp. Many of his pictures reflect the farces, allegorical plays and processions presented by the literary societies to which such people belonged and which were central to the intellectual and festive life of Netherlandish cities.It is difficult to believe that a theme like the Adoration could be conceived in a satirical spirit, yet the caricatural element may have a serious moral point. As the kings offer or wait to offer their gold, frankincense and myrrh to the Christ Child, the crowd has eyes only for the rich presents. The townsman in glasses on the right seems to look at the Moorish king Balthazar's magnificent censer with open-mouthed greed.

04580-port_man.jpg	When Jan van Bijlert and other Utrecht artists, such as Gerard van Honthorst, Hendrick Terbrugghen and Dirck van Baburen traveled to Rome in the early 1600s, they brought back a style that significantly transformed the art of their native town. These artists, known collectively as the Utrecht Caravaggisti, were greatly influenced by Caravaggio's use of chiaroscuro which dominated Italian painting in the early seventeenth century and had an extensive impact throughout Europe.  In 1624, van Bijlert brought his Caravaggesque manner back to his native city of Utrecht. By the 1630s, however, he adopted a more classicising style, strongly influenced by his Dutch contemporary, Gerard van Honthorst, as well as Simon Vouet. The present portrait belongs to this later period of the artist's career. Although highly speculative, it might be a portrayal of the Dutch poet and physician, Jacob Westerbaen (1599-1670)

10257-3silver.jpg	Similarly to the Golden Age, the source of the subject of this panel was the Greek poet Hesiod who divided the history of mankind into four successive ages: the Golden Age was followed by the Silver, then the Bronze and the Iron Age corresponding to the present. The inhabitants of the Silver Age let their unbridled temperaments get the better of them when they reached manhood and eked out a short existence full of strife. They showed no respect to the gods and were finally wiped off the face of the earth at the instigation of Zeus.

Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight.The hovering angel is derived from a painting by Sebastiano Ricci in San Stae, Venice.

23945-miracl7.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezi�res, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them.This canvas deals with a miraculous event which took place in 1474 during the funeral of a member of the Confraternity who had not believed firmly in the relic of the Holy Cross during his life. The reliquary containing the sacred fragment was taken to the funeral in the church of S. Lio but in the square outside the church it became so heavy that it could not be carried over the threshold. Another cross had therefore to be used while the one containing the Holy relic was entrusted to the care of the parish priest of S. Lio. The presentation of Campo S. Lio is rather static and analytical, the figural rhythms monotonous and the colouring somewhat lacking in richness and interest, but the picture is nevertheless valuable for the evidence it offers of the architecture and costumes of the time

The head is fully worked up, the body much less so, while the hands are scarcely indicated at all. Being an 'unfinished' self-portrait, it would not have been signed or dated (though its authenticity is unquestionable). In conception, it still shows much of the breadth of form which the artist had favoured in the late 1650s, both in his subject pictures and in other self-portraits. On the other hand, the forms have become flatter and the facial expression less aggressive. It is as if Rembrandt had wished to show himself as more forlorn.The mysterious circles on the wall, though clearly behind the artist's head, rein- force the sense of a composition conceived as a surface design.

42570-11drink.jpg	Signature: Not signed.Provenance: The painting first appeared in the sale Jan van Loon, Delft, 1736. It was subsequently. bought by John Hope, Amsterdam, in 1774. His sons fled to England when the French invaded Holland in 1794, and the painting seems to have remained the property of the family until the whole collection was sold in 1898 to the art dealers P. and D. Colnaghi and A. Wertheimer. It was acquired by the museum in 1901.The leaden window to the left was entirely overpainted at the time of the purchase by the museum and replaced by a curtain and a view upon a landscape through an open window. When the painting became part of the museum's collections, it was cleaned and the overpaints removed, restoring the original composition. This was the time when genre painting flourished, and artists like Pieter de Hooch, Jan Steen, Frans van Mieris, and Gerard Ter Borch, to name only a few, placed their figures into a light-filled room or courtyard, showing them either socializing or preoccupied with domestic chores. Vermeer's works set the tone for representations of the upper bourgeoisie, a social level more refined than that depicted by his contemporaries. This type of setting required finer and smoother pictorial rendition than, for instance, the Milkmaid.Consequently, Vermeer adapted his brushwork to the new needs, and more than equaled a Frans van Mieris, for instance, in the delicacy and finesse of the execution. It is proposed by some critics that Vermeer was the originator of the genre. It was he who influenced Pieter de Hooch, not the other way around, as was previously assumed. His elegance, sophistication, and majestic stillness assert the primacy of his conceptions over the more pedestrian de Hooch, who attained brief artistic heights only under Vermeer's impetus during his Delft sojourn in the late 1650s.Like A Lady and Two Gentlemen, this seduction scene contains an open window which features the warning figure of Temperance.

In the soldiers' uniforms and the caparison worn by the horse to the left of the cross, we see the artist taking pleasure in the decorative elements of the clothing. The composition also seeks to bring together all the components making up the Crucifixion episode: the Virgin and the three Marys; the Magdalene kneeling at the foot of the cross; the soldiers playing dice in the foreground; the Good Centurion giving Christ the sponge with the vinegar; the Good Thief (on the left, his soul being carried off by an angel); and the Bad Thief (on the right, his soul being carried off by a devil); and finally, the skeleton of Adam.A large number of figures crowd into the heterogeneous lower part of the composition with no space between them. In the upper part, however, the composition has been emptied in order to emphasize the figure of Christ, creating spatial depth through the positioning of the two thieves in foreshortening and on a lower level.

32983-05double.jpg	"This austere double portrait of great stylistic restraint, set against a green background, in which the two figures, perhaps intentionally conceived by the artist in the manner of Roman busts, seem not to communicate with one another, has never roused a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of critics. In fact, no one has ever seriously studied of this painting and, even though it is now almost universally agreed to be the work of Raphael, the identity of the two figures has remained highly debatable. Some have seen them as Luther and Calvin (Pamphilj inventory of circa 1684), or as Bartolo da Sassoferrato and Baldo degli Ubaldi, two fourteenth-century jurists (inventory of Olimpia Aldobrandini ante 1665), or as Andrea Doria and Christopher Columbus, an interesting idea, or finally, as Andrea Navagero and Agostino Beaziano, a highly plausible identification that has been accepted by the most recent literature.We know from a letter written by Pietro Bembo on April 3, 1516, to Cardinal Bibbiena, that Raphael, Castiglione, Navagero and Beaziano had planned to make a trip to Tivoli together the following day. It is likely that the artist intended to paint a dual portrait of the two men: Andrea Navagero (1453-1529; humanist and man of letters, since 1515 librarian of St Mark's, who left Rome at the end of April for Venice, so his portrait would have to have been finished before his departure) and Agostino Beaziano (born in Treviso around the last decade of the fifteenth century and died in 1549, he started on a career in diplomacy through the intercession of Bembo, who took him around so that he could establish links with the most famous personages on the Roman scene). It is also likely that the painting was intended for their common friend Bembo, and it is in fact recorded as belonging to him in 1538, when he gave it to the surviving member of the pair, Beaziano, begging him ""to take care that [the two heads] do not get spoilt."" These facts are confirmed by the contemporary Marcantonio Michiel, who adds that the double portrait was painted on panel. This has led some critics to reject the Doria Pamphilj picture, considering it to be a copy on canvas. Yet it is easy to eliminate this objection, given that the picture here, already listed in the collection of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini in 1603 (as ""Two portraits both the work of Raffaelle Da Urbino,"" and thus without any reference to the identity of the figures), later passed into that of Olimpia Aldobrandini Pamphilj, where it was cited before 1665 as canvas applied to panel. The wooden support was later removed, leaving the work in its present state. It would seem therefore correct to identify this picture (of which there are two copies with separate portraits in the Prado) as the Portrait of Navagero and Beaziano, painted by Raphael in April 1516 as a mark of their friendship.However a degree of uncertainty must remain, especially with regard to the age of the figures, which appears to be greater than that of the two men at the time, about thirty-three and twenty-six, respectively. In addition, other portraits that are definitely of Andrea Navagero, such as the 1526 one by Titian's school in Berlin or the one in a Roman collection, raise further doubts about the identification. The difficulties in judging similarities of appearance are well known, especially where historical personages are concerned.So the problem of Raphael's Double Portrait in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj remains unsolved"

35624-060simon.jpg	Of the examples of 'filial piety' in the literature of antiquity, that of Cimon and Pero was one of the ones that appealed most to artists of the 16th to 18th centuries in Italy and the Netherlands. Valerius Maximus tells of a certain Cimon, an aged man, who was in prison awaiting execution and who was therefore given no food. The jailer allowed Cimon's daughter Pero to visit him. She nourished him by giving him her breast. The scene is a prison cell; the white-haired prisoner, manacled, reclines in the lap of a young woman who is suckling him.

10975-201david.jpg	David owed his rise to fame - after many reversals - to a painting for the execution of which he took his family to Rome, in order to absorb himself totally in the world of antique forms. It was The Oath of the Horatii.When he arrived to Rome, David rent a studio in the Via del Babuino. He worked in a very methodical manner on The Oath of the Horatii, drawing from life models and draped mannequins, and some very detailed studies survive for many of the main figures. He had accessories such as the swords and helmets made by local craftsmen so that they could serve as props. Drouais is supposed to have assisted David, painting the arm of the rear Horatii brother and the yellow garment of Sabina. The painting was finished at the end of July 1785, and was then exhibited in David's studio. David signed the painting and added the painting's place of origin to the signature and date: L David / faciebat / Romanae /Anno MDCCLXXXIV. The painting created a sensation, even the Pope wanted to view it.The story is from the 7th century B.C., and it tells of the triplet sons of Publius Horatius, who decided the struggle between Rome and Albalonga. One survived, but he killed his own sister because she wept for one of the fallen foes, to whom she was betrothed. Condemned to death for the murder of a sibling, Horatius' son is pardoned by the will of the people.Because of its austerity and depiction of dutiful patriotism, The Oath of the Horatii is often considered to be the clearest expression of Neoclassicism in painting. The painting's uncompromising directness, economy and tension made it instantly memorable and full of visual impact. Each of the three elements of the picture - the sons, the father and the women - is framed by a section of a Doric arcade, and the figures are located in a narrow stage-like space. David split the picture between the masculine resolve of the father and brothers and the slumped resignation of the women.. The focal point of the work is occupied by the swords that old Horatius is about to distribute to his sons. While the rear two brothers take the oath with their left hands, the foremost one swears with his right. Perhaps David did this simply as a way of grouping the figures together, but people at the time noticed this detail, and some supposed that this meant that the brother in the front would be the one to survive the combat

05196-08crucif.jpg	Hieronymus Bosch lived and worked at 's-Hertogenbosch where he was born into a family of artists coming originally from Aachen. He was introduced into high society, where he received commissions from prestigious persons. He is known for his works peopled with demonic beings, revealing an exceptional independence from the pictorial tradition of his time. However,the Crucifixion with a Donor, which is attributed to him, is perfectly in line with the iconographic tradition of the 15th century.The composition shows a sort of hierarchical intercession procedure. The kneeling donor is praying for his salvation. He is accompanied by his patron, St Peter, identified by the key in his hand. Turning towards St John the Evangelist, St Peter presents his prot�g�. St John then looks towards the Virgin, asking her to intercede with her Son, which she does by praying. Christ figures on the cross as a sign of redemption, his sacrifice having made possible the salvation of the human race. The scene is portrayed in the place reserved for the torture of condemned criminals, on the edge of a Brabant city which is visible in the distance. Midway, a broken gibbet lies on the ground, surrounded by scattered bones and crows. Some figures are walking along the paths leading towards a mill to the left and a castle to the right.The donor's identity is not known. Only his first name, Peter, is indicated by the presence of his patron saint. He is dressed in a white shirt and a brown pourpoint. Over this he wears a black cape and a hat on his head. His legs are dressed in striped black and red breeches and stockings decorated with the same motif. A sword shows out from under the cape. This costume, which was worn in the Low Countries during the last 20 years of the 15th century, could indicate that the donor was in a lord's service.We do not know whether this panel originally had wings. No other crucifixion by Hieronymus Bosch is known, although the theme returns as a secondary motif in others of his paintings. It is also one of the master's few works containing a donor portrait. The style displays a striking balance and serenity. The flesh colours of Christ's body are softened and the draperies sober. The countryside shows a very gentle gradation of greens, producing a successful effect of depth.

32771-06madonn.jpg	Before his arrival in Florence, Raphael had already had occasion to compose small-scale devotional icons of the Madonna and Child, linked to a taste for the versions created by Perugino. An interesting sequence of this type can be seen in several examples, all from around 1502 to 1504, built on the motif of the Madonna holding a book. They are known as the Solly Madonna (in Berlin), the Norton Simon Madonna (in California) and the Conestabile Madonna (in St. Petersburg).The Madonna is holding the Christ Child with great tenderness. The two are also linked as they read the book of hours that is open at the prayer of Nones, the ninth hour after dawn in the Church's day.

23842-3manet01.jpg	The two Morisot sisters, Edma and Berthe, were not only women of great character, they were also very talented painters. Manet met them in the Louvre, where they were copying. Both sisters were infatuated with the handsome painter. Berthe received from him not lessons but advice, and became his favourite model.Manet returned several times to painting Berthe Morisot's languishing face and languishing attitudes. He clearly sought something more than the merely pictorial in this strange young woman, who was always dressed soberly in Manet's favourite colours, black and white. Her face inspired Manet, as witness the many rapidly brushed portraits without a trace of pentimenti. In the Repose, he effortlessly conveys the ardent soul of the young woman

37330-5orsini.jpg	"The altarpiece known as Passion Polyptych (or Orsini Polyptych), with panels now in a number of European museums (Angel of the Annunciation and Virgin of Annunciation, as well as Crucifixion and Deposition in Antwerp, the Road to Calvary in Paris and the Entombment in Berlin) is signed ""Pinxit Symon"" on the two panels of the Crucifixion and the Deposition. It presents several problems, both in terms of stylistic analysis and dating.Some scholars, stressing the fact that it is so different stylistically from all the other works of Simone's Avignon period (nervous lines and expressions), think that it may have been painted earlier and then transported to France; others believe that it may be a late work, commissioned by Napoleone Orsini, who died in the Curia in Avignon in 1342.

They were maintained by the King according to a tradition extending back well into the Middle Ages. The tradition was motivated by charity, but many 'fools' came to be appreciated for their wit, arousing great affection and sometimes achieving great fame. Because they were not taken seriously, they were licenced to parody or flout the etiquette with which courtiers and royalty had to conform, which seems to have been especially appreciated at the rigid Court of Philip IV.Vel�zquez has used a variety of subtle devices in portraying them: particularly interesting is the way the light flickers uncertainly over Calabacillas' grimace, suggesting his poor vision.

02835-scenewin.jpg	"There are many interesting details in this crowded scene which was certainly inspired by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.Avercamp's early winter landscapes (from before 1608) are very Flemish in technique and composition: a very high horizon, many figures and a composition set up something like theatrical scenery. Between 1610 and 1620, however, the horizon in his paintings drops lower and lower, the scenery-like elements are thinned out and the figures become more grouped within the composition. Around 1615, the theme of ""Winter landscape with skaters"" was gradually transformed into a depiction of the ""Joys of winter"", with the accent clearly on the figures. After 1620, he absorbed the influence of Esaias van den Velde and Jan van Goyen, and his compositions became more enclosed, with the figures melting somewhat into the landscape."

22661-3adorati.jpg	"From the mid-1450s through the mid-1460s, Filippo Lippi evolved a new presentation of the Virgin and Child that became popular in the second half of the Quattrocento in Florence. The composition and iconography were grounded in two traditions: St Bridget of Sweden's account of her vision of the Virgin adoring the Christ Child lying upon the ground, and early Renaissance Tuscan depictions of the Nativity. Fra Filippo transformed the subject into a distinct devotional image set within an elaborated forested landscape with a rich imagery of sylvan flora, geological features, and atmosphere, which functioned as visual metaphors for the Incarnation, penitence, and eremitical religious devotion.Fra Filippo's first version of this type was this Adoration (ostensibly a Nativity), made for the Benedictine Annalena nunnery in Florence around 1455. In this composition St Joseph is present beside the Virgin and Child, the ass and ox lie placidly in the manger, and shepherds look on, while angels bearing the inscription ""Gloria in excelsis Deo"" hover above.Lippi's subsequent elaborations of this type, however, omit these narrative markers: the triptych for Alfonso of Naples, whose lost central panel is known only through a rapid sketch by Fra Filippo and the surviving wings representing Sts Anthony Abbot and Michael, the altarpiece for the chapel in the Palazzo Medici, and a painting said to have come from a cell in the Camaldoli hermitage, dedicated to the Baptist and patronized by Piero di Cosimo de' Medici and his wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni, built in 1463.These images are set in a dark, wooden landscape where the Madonna kneels, her hands clasped together in devotion, before the Christ Child lying virtually nude upon the verdant forest ground. God the Father (or simply his hands) in the Camaldoli picture) appears above and the Holy Spirit descends toward the Child, proceeded by tongues of fire. The Child is surrounded by an aura of dancing gilded flames and the Virgin and Child truly glow with divine light.In this version the Holy Family is represented together with St Hilary, St Jerome and St Magdalene"

Collection P. A. B. Widener, Philadelphia. Widener collection in the museum, 1965.This painting has been known until recently as ""The Goldweigher"" or ""Girl Weighing Pearls"". Microscopic analysis, however, has revealed the pans of the balance to be empty. The highlight on the pans is not rendered with lead-tin yellow, which is used elsewhere on the canvas to depict gold. Vermeer represented pearls with a thin gray layer topped with a white highlight. The pan highlight is a single layer. In addition, there no loose pearls on the table that would indicate other pearls waiting to be weighed.This seemingly trivial analysis as to what is being weighed actually bears importantly on the meaning of the work. For ""Woman Holding a Balance"" is overtly allegorical. The woman stands between a depiction of the Last Judgment hung in a heavy black frame and a table covered with jewelry representing material possessions. The empty scale stresses that she is balancing spiritual rather than material considerations. Vermeer's portrayal does not impart a sense of tension or conflict, rather the woman exudes serenity. Her self-knowledge is reflected in the mirror on the wall. Vermeer's point is that we should lead lives of moderation with full understanding of the implications of a final judgment.The composition is designed to focus attention on the small and delicate balance being held. The woman's arms act as a frame, with the small finger of her right hand extended to echo the horizontal lever of the balance. The bottom of the painting frame is even altered to provide a partial niche for the scales. The frame ends higher in front of the woman than it does behind her. The complex interplay between verticals and horizontals, objects and negative space, and light and shadow results in a strongly balanced, yet still active composition. The scales are balanced, but dynamically asymmetrical. A cleaning in 1994 revealed previously undetectable gold trim on the black frame that provides a tonal link to the yellow of the curtain and the woman's costume.Vermeer has endowed ""Woman Holding a Balance"" with more overtly allegorical context than his other domestic scenes. As such, it loses some of the invitingly subjective interpretation of a less direct work such as ""Woman in Blue Reading a Letter"". Nevertheless, Vermeer's masterful composition and execution produced a powerful and moving work"

00422-2crucif1.jpg	The Veronese painter Altichiero studied Giotto's frescoes in Padua and borrowing from them developed new forms of pictorial architecture. Around 1380, he and Jacopo Avanzo painted a cycle of frescoes in the Chapel of San Giacomo in the Santo (the church of Sant'Antonio) in Padua. The group compositions of his Crucifixion are those of Giotto's figures, but the architecture is structured so that it seems to recede ever deeper into the background of the picture. Only a stone's throw from the chapel, the young Titian was to work in the Scuola del Santo in 1511, where he was deeply impressed by Altichiero's colour scheme and composition.

35561-11boybir.jpg	A child of about two is shown playing with a captive bird. On the original panel, which was smaller, only the child's head was visible. Rubens made use of this study for an angel in the Madonna with a Floral Wreath in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.  Later the artist enlargened the picture on the left side, adding the hands with the bird.Although formerly taken to be a girl, the child portrayed is in all probability Rubens' first son Albert, who was born in 1614. The motif of the child playing with a bird goes back to antiquity. It also crops up frequently in Christian art. The bird symbolizes the soul or life, which passes all too quickly. In many pictures of the Virgin and Child, Jesus is portrayed holding a bird in his hand as an allusion to his death and resurrection. Whether Rubens had a similar allegory in mind when he introduced the bird into his child-portrait, or whether some particular incident in his own life motivated him, is not known.

26144-37frag2.jpg	A number of correspondences, including dimensions, origins and inscriptions prove that the three fragments In Bucharest (the Standing Virgin and Child and the two panels with donors) belong together. They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.The Virgin is represented in an unusual portal construction, flanked by two brown marble columns, supporting wooden beams. She stands with the Christ Child on her arm before a cloth of honour in red and black brocade. The construction runs obliquely to the left, with the Virgin turned frontally towards the painter. This shifting of the viewpoint relative to the painting's axis was a favourite perspective effect of Memling's.The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date. Similar triangular pieces have also been inserted to the left and right of the woman. Like the horizontal strip above the heads in both panels, these additions (to replace damaged or sawn-out sections?) were already present in 1656, when the panels were part of the collection of Leopold Wilhelm

03307-predell4.jpg	In 1485 Domenico Ghirlandaio received the commission for the Adoration of the Magi for the main altar in the church of the Spedale degli Innocenti. The prior of the church, Tesori, also commissioned the predella with stories of the Virgin and the great cornice of the altarpiece. The latter had been executed by the carpenter Francesco Bartolo on designs by Giuliano da Sangallo, while the scenes of the predella are the work of one of Ghirlandaio's pupils, Bartolomeo di Giovanni; this is confirmed by the records and the workmanship of the fine, slender figures which are characteristic of him.The predella, with the Martyrdom of St John the Evangelist, the Annunciation, the Marriage of the Virgin, the Deposition, the Presentation in the Temple, the Baptism of Christ, the Consecration of the Church of the Innocenti, had been dismembered at the time of the restoration of the great altar (1615). In the 19th century the seven panels were in the Sala delle Adunanze. Later they were reunited with the painting, which was now devoid of Sangallo's fine cornice that was destroyed in the restoration of 1786.The picture shows one of the seven predella paintings

05932-crucifix.jpg	This painting may have come from the church of S. Maria di Brera. At one time it was probably an organ shutter. It was formerly attributed to Bramante.A late work, this painting reveals Bramantino's background. His roots were in the art of Ercole de' Roberti, the most energetically emotional fifteenth- century painter in northern Italy. It is from this source that Bramantino drew his highly dramatic style, which led him to freeze the tragedy of the Crucifixion within a framework of lucid abstraction. At the same time he seized the opportunity to seek out new means of formal expression. The crosses of the two thieves are arranged in terms of a centralized perspective, creating a space almost like an interior, and leading directly to the background where typical Bramantino buildings are silhouetted against an evening sky. (One of the buildings resembles the Trivulzio mausoleum, which was designed by the artist.)The marked bisymmetry of the painting, with angel and demon, sun and moon, is less structured in the choral rhythm of the foreground. The Madonna's grief is represented within the circle described by the hands of the saints, while the Magdalene lifts her arms toward the cross as if to raise it up to heaven. A strict intellectual approach dominates the colour scheme, in which subdued olive greens, golden grays and browns predominate.

40395-7hermits.jpg	The subject of this painting is rather unusual. In a rocky landscape with forests and caves populated by animals and monks engaged in a variety of activities, we recognize St Benedict in a pulpit, St Bernard and his vision, St Jerome in penance, and St Francis receiving the stigmata. Such a composition does not adhere to any standardized iconography but appears to be a celebration of monasticism in general. The painting can be defined as a Thebaid, i.e. a depiction of the lives of the holy hermits of the first centuries of the Christian era, who retreated as hermits into the Egyptian desert around Thebes.

33453-17oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 516.The subject is taken from the Apocryphal History of Susanna. Two Jewish Elders, hidden in the garden, threaten Susanna that they will publicly accuse her of committing adultery with a young man unless she gives herself to them. She is eventually exonerated by the wise judge, Daniel, and the Elders are punished.The subject, like that of Bathsheba, clearly had a considerable fascination for Rembrandt and is evidence (of which there is plenty more elsewhere in his work) that he was a man of strong sensuality. He made numerous drawings of Susanna and at least one other painting, now in The Hague. That picture executed in 1636 was, in fact, used as the starting point for the present one, which appears to have been begun shortly afterwards, i.e. ten years before it was completed in the form we see it now. As X-rays show, the Berlin painting consists of three layers, the first of which reveals the agitated type of composition characteristic of Rembrandt's style of the 1630s. When he re-painted the picture in 1647, he revised the design throughout, changing it into something much calmer. It is now the handling which is lively, not the composition. The figure style, the lighting, the colour and even the relationship of the figures to the landscape setting are all typical of the mid-1640s. For the composition, Rembrandt used a painting of the same subject by Lastman, also now in Berlin, which he copied in a drawing.

15369-assumpti.jpg	Don Silvestro dei Gherarducci was a monk of the Camaldolese monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli. He was a widely famed painter and miniaturist whose work was particularly favoured by Lorenzo de Medici (1449-1492), the Florentine statesman and patron of arts and letters known as Lorenzo the Magnificent. With Don Lorenzo Monaco and Don Simone Camaldolese, Gherarducci made up the most important late medieval school of Florentine painters, and enriched Florentine art with a new decorative colour harmony. Although Don Silvestro is known to have painted a number of altarpieces and devotional panels, he is famed for his work as a manuscript illuminator.in this panel painting the Madonna, dressed all in white, is sitting on a throne within a mandorla that is supported by six angels, three at each side, as it is being carried up to heaven. The angels are depicted in the typical mid fourteenth-century style: small and ephemeral creatures with slim bodies covered by long dresses and, apparently, no legs. Their fine and youthful features are surrounded by halos; their expressions show a participating presence that expects no response

05995-davidhar.jpg	Jan de Bray - a son and probably also a pupil of the painter and architect Salomon de Bray - was one of the most important representatives of Classicism in Haarlem. Although he mainly painted portraits, he was also a very skilled history painter. De Bray could immerse himself totally in a story, and this enabled him to capture historical scenes on canvas in a highly original way.A good example of  one of his successful history paintings is David Playing the Harp. David, King of Israel, can be identified by the crown, the harp he plays and his white linen garment as described in the Bible. As he plays, he raises his eyes to heaven. It is just possible to see the Ark of the Covenant being borne in behind him. The Ark, a magnificently decorated chest, contained the Jews' holy objects. The Philistines had captured it, but it brought them so much misfortune that they longed to be rid of it. Here David and 'all the Israelites' bear the Ark back to Jerusalem, accompanied by 'shouting and blowing of trumpets' (II Samuel 6)

32629-noblewom.jpg	The witty conceit of painting a picture within a picture has been splendidly adopted by Pulzone for this portrait of a noblewoman.  The trompe l'oeil curtain draped across the upper left corner of the canvas, alludes to a convention more typical of Renaissance portraiture, in which drapery was ofter depicted as a backdrop to the sitter and it may also refer to the custom of covering paintings with curtains. The curtain folds hang very convincingly over the canvas, casting a sharp shadow across the surface, and wrapping themselves around the tacked edge of the fictive unframed canvas.Some critics identified the sitter as Maria de' Medici, born in 1573, the daughter of Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici, and later Queen of France when she married Henri IV in 1600. In 1594, the year in which this picture was painted, Maria would have been twenty-one years old. Most single-figure portraits of Maria post-date her wedding and show the sitter almost twenty years older

30965-kastrup.jpg	Of the Danish landscape painters, it was unquestionably Philipsen who had the soundest grasp of Impressionism and most consistently adapted its views on light, colour, and brushwork. His speciality was in fact animal paintings, but his pictures of spring or autumnal landscapes near Copenhagen shared the distinctive mood of Pissarro and Sisley. The shadows of trees and fenceposts in A Lane at Kastrup were done in the bluish violet characteristic of Impressionism.

22970-bacchus.jpg	It was Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete, who helped Theseus, whom she loved, to escape from the labyrinth with the aid of a ball of string, but all she had in return was to be abandoned by him on the island of Naxos. Here Bacchus came to her rescue. Classical representations show Ariadne asleep when Bacchus arrives, as described by Philostratus. But according to Ovid she was at that moment lamenting her fate, and Renaissance and later artists generally depict her awake. Bacchus took her jeweled crown and flung it into the heavens where it became a constellation. Ariadne was readily consoled by him and they were married shortly afterwards.In Carle van Loo's representation, the transformed crown can be seen held above Ariadne's head by the accompanying putti and is an artful representation of the constellation

The painting is assumed by some scholars to be earlier (c. 1425-30) and the 1439 is only the date of completion and framing.The attention which Van Eyck focused upon the tender embrace of mother and child is characteristic of late-medieval devotion.

38408-drawingc.jpg	Sweerts was born and trained in Brussels: he spent several years in Rome but was back in Brussels by 1656 when he received permission to open an academy in the city. He joined the guild in Brussels in 1659 but two years later travelled to the Far East as a member of a Catholic missionary expedition. He died in Goa in 1664.Sweerts painted a number of pictures showing young artists drawing from plaster casts and drawing from life outside the studio, but this is his only painting of an academy. The work has a special significance in Sweerts's life as we know that he ran an 'academie van die teeckeninghen naer hetleven' (an academy for drawing from the life) in Brussels. While learning to draw from the antique and from models in his master's studio was a part of every Dutch and Flemish apprentice artist's training, academies of this type were rare in the Netherlands. Among the few precedents were those set up by Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem, Hendrick Goltzius and Carel van Mander in Haarlem around 1590, and by Hendrick van Uylenburgh in Amsterdam in the 1620s. Sweerts, having lived in Italy for several years, presumably had Italian prototypes in mind such as the academy established by Baccio Bandinelli in 1531 in the Belvedere in Rome.Around the same time that he applied to open his academy, Sweerts made a series of etchings to be used in teaching young students to draw. Sadly, nothing more is known of Sweerts's academy

05246-02wayfar.jpg	In this circular painting Bosch reworked the figure of the wayfarer on the outer wings of the Haywain a decade or so later, this time placing him against one of his most delicately conceived landscapes. The rolling sand dunes at the right and the subdued tonalities of grey und yellow are sensitive transcriptions into paint of the rain-drenched Dutch countryside. The large foreground figure closely recalls the Haywain pilgrim, except that he appears even more haggard and poorly dressed. There are, however, some subtle differences. Except for the snarling dog, with its possible allusion to slander, the dangers of the world are here chiefly spiritual. They are embodied first of all in the tavern at the left, whose ruinous condition echoes the ragged clothes of the wayfarer. The tavern symbolizes the World and the Devil in general, its dubious nature revealed by the man urinating at the right, and by the couple embracing in the doorway. Another inmate of the house peers curiously through one of the dilapidated windows.The customer for whom the second woman waits may very well be the traveller himself. He has not just emerged from the tavern, but has passed it in his journey and his path leads towards a gate and the tranquil Dutch countryside beyond. Now he halts on the road, as if allured by its promise of pleasure. Whether the pilgrim will turn away from the tavern to pass through the gate is as doubtful.Some scholars assume that the picture represents an episode from the parable of the Prodigal Son.In this circular painting Bosch reworked the figure of the wayfarer on the outer wings of the Haywain a decade or so later, this time placing him against one of his most delicately conceived landscapes.

08427-boy_bask.jpg	"This painting (also called The Porter) belongs to a series of similar subjects that in part has been lot and in part is in private collections. It shows Ceruti's usual predilection for the humble and amiable aspects of everyday working life. His renderings of men at work and workers at rest earned him the nickname of ""Little Beggarman"" (pitocchetto); he was the bard of the otherwise unchronicled poor. This ""porter"" shows better than other works by the artist - which are more akin to genre scenes - his intense lyricism and idealizing abstraction. Devoid of indulgent description and reduced to essentials, the scene is composed on a system of opposed diagonals and has an atmosphere of subdued resignation. The boy, leaning against a large basket, is portrayed without apparent comment but the painting still suggests a life of hardship and Ceruti's sympathy with his subject"

21484-hagar.jpg	"Sarah, Abraham's childless wife, brought her Egyptian maid Hagar to him so that he would produce an heir with her. However, when she herself bore Isaac, she demanded of her husband: ""Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."" (Genesis 21:10) Hagar and Ismael wandered in the wilderness, dying of thirst. Yet God heard the lamentations of the mother and sent her an angel who showed her the way to a spring and prophesied that her son would be the founder of a great nation.In the painting, Hagar, who has been crying, is just lifting her head to look up at the angel in astonishment; her child, half hidden behind her shoulder, is also looking up incredulously at the kindly angel who has taken Hagar by the arm and is showing her the way to the water. It is the handling of colour, in particular, that highlights the unexpected aspect of the occurrence so clearly: against the gloomy brown of the wasteland, the sumptuous red and midnight-blue of Hagar's robes radiate like a lamentation of pathos. Her pale, exhausted face is turned towards the shining figure of the angel that seems to have brought light with it. Light bathes the figure, and radiates from the angel towards Hagar, rising in a pale cloud behind the angel and inflaming the orange of his hair and robe"

25112-5virgin.jpg	Clothed in a red mantle over a dark blue garment, the Virgin Mary sits on a bench which is draped with a green sheet. Behind her hangs a cloth of honour in green-gold brocade. The Child sits on her lap spreading his arms in a priestly welcoming gesture. Behind the bench is an angel approaching with a pear in his hand which he wants to offer to the Child. The symbolism of an apple or pear in the context of Salvation and of Christ as the new Adam is quite evident. The motif is certainly inspired by Memling. Through the window on the left there is a view onto a landscape with imaginary towers and on the right stands a chest on which there are utensils, a book and a red fruit (a cherry?). A rosary hangs on the wall. The reddish hair, the flesh colour with a whitish glow and the dark pupils are typical characteristics which were noticed early on in this master's oeuvre and which are quite noticeable here.

03438-09roche.jpg	"The painting is signed in Latin at lower right: ""IAC.s PO(N)TE/BASS.is/PINGEBAT."" Formerly it was on the main altar of the church of S. Rocco in Venice.This work shows an attempt to introduce a scene from life into an altarpiece, utilizing scenic devices derived from Mannerism but achieving very different results. There is an obvious kinship with Tintoretto, but Bassano has retained his own style in the impasto brushwork, the subtle taste for the picturesque and the peacefully slow movements. The novelty of this painting can be seen by comparing it with Titian's Pesaro Madonna. That work is composed similarly, on a diagonal in depth, and is also connected with a given social class, though a different one. In Titian's painting the scene is solemnly ceremonial and is laid at the door of a temple out of which the Virgin has just come. It is clear that the Venetian aristocrats and the Virgin all belong to the same exclusive elite. Here, however, the Virgin is relegated to a respectful distance, like a pendant image. The figures scattered about below, who are entirely absorbed by their own daily life and humble piety, do not notice her"

27086-woman_mi.jpg	Gerrit Dou called Frans van Mieris 'the Prince of my pupils'. Van Mieris was the son of a Leiden goldsmith and, like Dou himself, had been trained in the studio of a glass-painter before entering that of a painter. Van Mieris mastered Dou's highly finished technique and after his master's death was the leading exponent of the fijnschilder (fine painter) style. He spent his entire working life in Leiden, although (once again like Dou) he enjoyed a considerable international reputation: he received commissions from, among others, Duke Cosimo III de'Medici and Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, who unsuccessfully offered van Mieris the position of court painter in Vienna.This painting shows the traditional subject of a woman admiring herself in a mirror: in the work of Hieronymous Bosch, for example, it was a symbol of the sin of superbia (pride) but by the time it was painted by Gerard ter Borch and van Mieris it simply provided an opportunity for the painter to display his skill in rendering reflections and rich materials. Van Mieris highlights the shimmering satin dress and brightly coloured feather within the dark interior, encouraging the viewer to admire his craftsmanship and virtuosity.Despite his success van Mieris was constantly in debt and contemporary documents appear to support the accounts of an early biographer, Arnold Houbraken, who described him as a habitual drunkard. He was, however, well respected in Leiden and established a dynasty of painters: his sons, Willem and Jan, and his grandson, Frans van Mieris the Younger, imitated his meticulous style and continued to work in his manner until the 1760s

40738-06icon.jpg	The double door was the central entrance of a templon (an iconostasis) and once led to the sanctuary (bema). What is striking is the shape of the door with its twice-curved ogee arch, a feature that is known neither from Byzantine nor Russian royal doors. During the Byzantine period, double doors with a round arch were customary. They replaced the curtains which had previously been used to cover the entrances to the templon.The door is decorated with images painted on it over a gold background. The top left image shows the Archangel Michael in armour holding a raised sword, the top right image depicts Gabriel holding a staff and a sphaira (orb). Painted on the door's lower zone are the abbot Saint Zosimas and the ascetic hermit Mary of Egypt. They are represented at the moment when Zosimas administers communion to the former prostitute as a sign of forgiveness; she had atoned her sins as an anchorite in the desert for 47 years

23978-sanluca1.jpg	"The work (12 panels) was commissioned in 1453, when the artist was twenty-two years old, for the chapel of S. Luca in the church of S. Giustina, Padua. The figures represented, reading from upper left, are: St Daniel of Padua, St Jerome, the Virgin, Christ, St John, St Augustine, St Sebastian, St Scolastica, St Prosdocimus, St Benedict and St Justina.The original wooden frame in which Mantegna's signature had been incised was destroyed by lightning in the seventeenth century. Its loss radically alters the composition, as can be seen by the considerable difference in scale between the two registers. It is thus worth attempting a reconstruction, in order to grasp the meaning of the whole work.Probably commissioned by the donors to execute a Gothic-type altarpiece, Mantegna must have succeeded in altering the scheme substantially by inserting a thick molding between the two orders. This division set the two ranges much farther apart than they are today. Another device used by the artist to avoid the effect of caged images is the perspective in the centre of the composition whereby the upper panels were made smaller to suggest distance while the lower panels were made larger to imply that they are closer to the spectator. But the most sensational means is the stepped pavement, which must have been the ground plane of the suggested architectural construction. The whole must have made a sort of two-storied loggia, housing figures engaged in a Sacra Conversazione.Even without its original framework, the separate figures remain highly impressive. A lyric quality, unequalled in Mantegna's other work, is generated by the illusionistic effect of the figures, achieved by means of their ""wet drapery,"" which Mantegna must have rediscovered by studying classic Roman sculpture"

35443-74religi.jpg	In this composition, the only large-scale work on this subject by Rubens, he portrays the saint, who is revered as the patron of music, playing a spinet at the foot of a formal, architectural vista of pillars. Beyond the terrace-like room stretches an expanse of Flemish landscape, yet the presence of the angels emphasizes the sublime character of the scene. As her ringers touch the keys of her instrument, the saint is entranced by celestial music and in her face is reflected the heavenly paradise towards which she gazes, wide-eyed.The Berlin Saint Cecilia is one of the last pictures which Rubens painted, apart from official commissions towards the end of his life. As in so many pictures during this later period, Helene Fourment, who had become his second wife in 1630, served as the artist's model. The bold and rapid application of colour is vivacious and rich in delicate nuances: deep emerald green appears side by side with dark red and brilliant yellow, emphasizing the pale, enamel-like flesh-tones. There are many corrections to the painted surface which show that Rubens altered considerable portions of the picture while working on it, and even enlarged the panel on the left-hand side.The formal interpretation in the composition in no way detracts from the human, almost intimate, touches which Rubens has employed in depicting the saint. The casually worn cloak, the foot withdrawn from the shoe, the sleeping dog, and, last but not least, the features of Helene Fourment are all products of highly personal experience. The painter transforms the youthful body of his model into a monumental figure which combines, in a most moving way, portrait and sacred image.This painting, which was found in Rubens' house following his death (1640), was presented the following year by his family to Jakob van Ophem in Brussels as a token of their gratitude for the help he had given in administering the artist's estate. Later it found its way to Paris, where the young Watteau saw it and made a crayon drawing of it.

36497-virgin_a.jpg	The painting has been truncated at all sides sometime between 1747 and 1769. The losses in the lower zone are most considerable: here the allegorical figures are shorn of their lower parts, and the landscape with a tower construction in the background seems brusquely interrupted.In the painting, Christ appears among the clouds in the act of hurling punitive bolts of lightning on three figures of women who cling to each other fearfully below. They represent allegories of Lust (the young, partially nude figure to the left), Avarice (the elderly woman clinging possessively to her bag in the centre), and Pride (the woman clad in showy dress, jewels, and feathered headdress to the right). The Virgin, kneeling at Christ's feet, implores pity for the sinners. The surrounding angels echo her plea.Formerly the painting was attributed to Dosso Dossi.

35868-sleeping.jpg	Seventeenth century artists often painted people lsleeping, but usually it is obvious what the subject was doing before falling into the arms of Morpheus - a woman sleeping at a spinning wheel, a student sleeping at his books, for example. In these cases the theme is sloth, one of the seven sins, and the viewer was expected to observe the message and follow it. In this intimate painting by David Ryckaert, there is no association with work or study at all. Nevertheless, it seems that this sin is also the theme here

13713-2assunt1.jpg	The old Humilitati monastery of San Cristoforo in Vercelli was entrusted to the aristocratic family of the Corradi di Lignano in the fifteenth century. In the early sixteenth century Provost Nicolini Corradi had the old church torn down and a replacement built. Andrea Corradi's assumption of office as provost in July 1529 was accompanied by an elaborate campaign of decoration. The new church was decorated with a retable for the high altar and two fresco cycles in the transept, in the Cappella dell'Assunta and the Cappella della Maddalena, all by Gaudenzio Ferrari. The artist had returned to Vercelli in 1528 after a long period of activity in Varallo.The first frescoes were in the Cappella della Maddalena, to the right of the chancel. Gaudenzio Ferrari painted the enormous Crucifixion of Christ on the end wall of the side aisle above the altar. On the adjacent side wall four additional scenes from the legend of Mary Magdalene are arranged in two rows around the central window.After the completion of the frescoes in the Cappella della Maddalena in 1532, Andrea Corradi concluded a contract with Ferrari to decorate the chapel of the left transept arm, the Cappella dell'Assunta. The decoration was completed in 1534.In this chapel, the themes of the painted stories are devoted entirely to the life of Mary: The Assumption is above the altar and four additional scenes are on the side wall. In the scene Birth of Mary, the annunciation to her parents, Anne and Joachim, is integrated into the background. The adjacent field unites the presentation of Mary in the temple, in which the child entered temple service, with her betrothal in the foreground in which the high priest wed the Virgin and Joseph. The Birth of Christ has the earlier scenes of the Annunciation to Mary and the Visitation in the background. The Adoration of the Kings completes the group of four frescoes.The cycles in the two chapels, completed in succession, are closely related to each other. They correspond in not only in the form of the wall articulations but also in the structure of the content. Each of the paintings of the lower row in both cycles is a variation on the theme of the episode immediately above it and thus they comment on each other

33982-potiphar.jpg	"Joseph was the elder son of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob and of Rachel. His numerous older brothers were strictly only half-brothers, being the sons of Leah or of handmaidens. The events of his romantic life story have been depicted continuously in Christian art from the 6th century onwards. The medieval Church saw the episodes of his life as a prefiguration of the life of Christ, and it is to this that he owes his important place in Christian art.When in Egypt as a slave, Potiphar, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites and made him steward of his household (Gen. 39:7-20). Potiphar's wife 'cast her eyes over him and said, ""Come and lie with me.""' He refused her though she continued to press him. One day when they were alone together she clutched his robes, pleading with him to make love to her. At this, Joseph fled so precipitately that he left his cloak at her hands.

06257-01eleono.jpg	This view shows the altarpiece and the frescoes in the Chapel of Eleonora da Toledo in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence.In 1540, soon after marrying Eleonora of Toledo, Cosimo de' Medici moved from the Palazzo Medici into the Palazzo della Signoria, publicly proclaiming his dominance over all civic institutions. Cosimo remodeled the building to accommodate his expanding family and commissioned elaborate decorative programs of the histories of his ancestors, of his own military conquests, and of dynastic portraiture to fill its vast spaces. On the upper floor Cosimo constructed a small cubical chapel for Eleanor's private devotions, completely decorated by Bronzino with imagery that ostensibly referred to Christian redemption but which barely veiled his dynastic and political intentions. The wall frescoes all depict scenes from the life of Moses: the left-wall frescoes include the Miracle of the Spring (Moses Striking the Rock) and the Gathering of Manna, the right wall is covered by the fresco Crossing of the Red Sea, an uncommon subject in Christian chapels. The altarpiece currently in the chapel, depicting the Lamentation, is a replica Bronzino made in 1553 of his 1545 original (which was sent to France as a diplomatic gift and is now in the Mus�e des Beaux-Arts, Besan�on). Bronzino also removed the original flanking panels of St John the Baptist and St Cosmas and replaced them with side panels depicting the Annunciation. The frescoes of the vault represents Sts Michael, John the Evangelist, Jerome and Francis. For the decoration of the chapel Bronzino applied an unusual technique: the underpainting was true fresco and the finished layer in tempera. The combination of complex figural compositions, rich colours, and elaborate decorative motifs within the chapel's small space create a bejewelled effect typical of Mannerism as practiced at the court of Cosimo and Eleonora. The style employed by Bronzino in the chapel frescoes resembles the cool, calculated manner which can be seen in his portraits

09095-selfport.jpg	This Self-Portrait falls in line with the artist's native tradition - as practised with supreme mastery by his Flemish contemporaries. The realism which characterized portraiture in the Netherlands is obvious here in a work of great seriousness, which captures not just the artist's appearance but also his character. Notable are the expressive hands outlined against his austere black clothing. Finely drawn and modelled in a soft chiaroscuro, they give the portrait movement and naturalness, contrasting with the serious and static character of the face

The painting represents the realistic and symbolic victory after many years of bitterness, sacrifice and humiliation especially for Venice, which under Turkish pressure had to give up many lands, ports and commercial affairs over the years with the evident consequence of the rapid and continuous loss of power and wealth.The entire painting is a frenetic encounter between ships hooked in mortal assaults on the decks boarded by enemy armies; they pursue or ram each other in a desperate attempt to annihilate one another.

22336-sebasti1.jpg	Before he was definitively identified as Lieferinxe, this painter of the Proven�al school was given the name The Master of St Sebastian, after an ancon that he painted with images of Sts Sebastian and Roche, the protectors against the plague. Decorated with eight scenes of the life of St Sebastian, this devotional object was commissioned in 1497 for the church of Notre Dame des Accoules in Marseilles. Lieferinxe, born in Hainaut, Cambrai, and active in Marseille and Aix-en-Provence, took over painting when the original artist, Bernardino Simondi, died before finishing the work. Aside from this example, other panels from the same project can be found in the museums in Philadelphia (Philadelphia Museum of Art), St. Petersburg (Hermitage), and Baltimore (Walters Art Gallery). The Rome panel, together with one of the Philadelphia panels and the one from Baltimore, comprised the right section of the great ancon.The painting style of Lieferinxe, despite his Flemish training, fits most closely with the Avignonese school, and reveals connections to the Bramantesque culture of Lombardy

14085-madonna.jpg	"This is the right wing of a diptych, originally located in Melun. The left wing showing �tienne Chevalier and St Peter the Martyr is in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin.On the right-hand shutter of what was once a diptych is a slender female figure standing, with one breast bare. She has the bulging shaved forehead fashionable at the period. Her face and skin as well as the body of the Infant Jesus are a pale grey-white, as if painted in grisaille; the grey-blue of her robe makes for an impression of fatigue and languor. The throne, sumptuously adorned with marble panels, pearls, precious stones and great gold tassels, is surrounded by cherubs painted in vivid red and blue; their figures, recalling two-dimensional decorations, completely fill the rest of the panel. There is a tradition that Agn�s Sorel, this famous beauty of the period, was the model for this Madonna, and the extraordinarily fashionable and somewhat frivolous appearance of the figure, unbefitting the Queen of Heaven, gives some ground for believing it not too far from the truth. In The Waning of the Middle Ages Huizinga described this painting as a most appalling example of a dangerous blend of amorous and religious feelings. ""There is a flavour of blasphemous boldness about the whole,"" he wrote"

17492-02virgin.jpg	The theme of the Holy Family became popular in early sixteenth-century Flemish painting, particularly in Antwerp and most notably with Joos van Cleve and his workshop there. Unlike Joos, who placed his Holy Family in a modest domestic interior or before a parapet with Joseph reading devotional texts, Gossart envisaged Joseph, Mary, and the Christ Child at the edge of an enclosed palace courtyard where angels and elegant ladies intermingle.

13380-2closed.jpg	The realism of the figures of Adam and Eve at the far right and left on the open altarpiece struck contemporary viewers forcefully, and this style continues on the outside of the panels when the altarpiece is closed. The external decoration shows the Erithraean and Cumaean Sibyls, Prophets Zacharias and Micheas, the figures of Jodocus Vyd, the donor, and his wife Isabelle Borluut kneeling on either side of two grisaille (painted in gray to resemble statuary) representations of St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist, and the Annunciation with the angel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary. The angel and the Virgin of the Annunciation are separated by two small panels, one with the representation of an arched window looking out upon a city square, and the other with a wash basin and ewer set into a niche and a white towel hanging from a rail beside it.A striking feature is the disparity in the scale of the various figures: no less than four changes of scale exist of the outside of the wings. There are also disparities in approach; some parts are almost prosaically factual, others almost visionary in approach. Three orders of reality are present: a narrative representation of a sacred subject (the Annunciation), two highly factual donor portraits and two simulated sculptures. Yet there is a strong attempt to impose a uniform framework on these disparate elements through the governing factor of  the light, which falls uniformly in all the panels from the right, and also through the use in the upper panels of a beamed ceiling running through the whole scene, and, in the lower panels, of the same cusped trefoil arches to frame the figures.

18244-0605grec.jpg	The St Sebastian is El Greco's first life-size male nude, and it is one of the key works of the artist's first years in Spain.The Saint abandoned after his martyrdom and presumed death. The style is that of around 1580. The frontal placing of the nude figure and treatment of the forms avoids a three-dimensional emphasis. The greater prominence of the setting - and of actual depth, in the vista on the right - compared with the paintings for Santo Domingo, the Cathedral and the Escorial, depends on the subject. In comparable representations of Saints, as of the Magdalene or Saint Jerome in the wilderness, he continues to indicate a setting. Where the image alone is demanded, as in his series of Apostles, a setting is omitted. In this painting the forms of tree and rock and the silhouette of the foliage are made to continue the plane of the figure. It is perhaps the natural sequence in the process of dematerialisation that the more flexible elements, the draperies, preceded the nude figure and natural forms.El Greco did not use the pose again for a Saint Sebastian.

39405-6maryeg.jpg	In the Sala Inferiore there are two paintings of a solitary woman in a twilit, well-wooded and -watered landscape. Traditionally, but unconvincingly, the women are identified as St Mary Magdalen and St Mary of Egypt, penitent hermits who have nothing to do with context of the decoration of the room. The woman is the same in both paintings sitting in two adjacent spots by the same stream and wearing the same clothes. In one painting she faces the observer virtually head-on and in the other almost completely turns her back on us. In one pose she lowers her gaze to her closed book and in the other raises her eyes from the now open book in rumination. In all likelihood this is a dual picture of Mary as the protagonist of the story of redemption.St Mary Magdalen is captured from the front, engrossed in reading, and given prominence like the large tree trunk on the left by a phosphorescent light falling on a magically mysterious nature. She is succinctly defined in the final fleeting instant before the night shadows fall on the outline of the rustic cottages, on the rolling plains, on the ridges of the hills and mountains.Like the landscape with the figure of St Mary of Egypt, this work too was influenced by northern models: it suggests the paintings and prints of the Danube School (for instance by Albrecht Altdorfer and Wolf Huber), and woodcuts by Hans Baldung Grien, the Nuremberg graphic artist Virgil Solis, and the mysterious artist, known only by his monogram of HWG, who depicts St John the Evangelist on Patmos, surrounded by a fantastic landscape

These were done in pastel and in them she explored the finest shadings of her subjects' characters, the most fleeting of their moods.

The two London panels depicting the Agony in the Garden by Mantegna and by Bellini respectively define the artistic interdependence of the two brothers-in-law: the technical innovations and organization of the Paduan painter and the pre-eminence of the Venetian in the field of light and colour.This painting may have been made for private devotional use, a function for which this iconography is appropriate.

18999-haydn.jpg	Guttenbrunn's portrait of Haydn exists in two versions. It is possible that the first dates from his encounter with Haydn at the Esterh�zy court in the early 1770s, and the second from their encounter in London in the early 1790s. The second version is more detailed than the first, and was the basis for an engraving (1792) by Luigi Schiavonetti.The portrait shows Haydn in the act of composing: he is seated at a keyboard, gazing into the distance, testing out notes with one hand and putting pen to paper with the other.

35844-deventer.jpg	Salomon van Ruysdael, the uncle of Jacob Ruisdael, was, with Jan van Goyen, the greatest painter of Dutch inland waterways. He lived in Haarlem, painting small pictures for sale rather than on commission, mostly variations on the native landscape; late in life he also executed some still lifes with dead game. Water soon became the major element in his work, beginning with atmospheric descriptions of cottages silhouetted against rain-laden clouds, and progressing to views of lakes, ponds, rivers, canals and ditches with trees reflected in their calm or slowly running waters. After 1640 his work grew bolder, the intimate backwaters giving way to more open vistas, almost marine riverscapes from which trees disappear, to be replaced, as here, by boats sailing close to the wind and the distant silhouettes of cities.Like many of van Ruysdael's later pictures, this view of Deventer, not topographically exact and probably derived from an engraving, seems almost to illustrate a passage in the influential treatise by Karel van Mander published in Haarlem in 1604. In prescribing attractive motifs for landscape painting, van Mander recommends: 'The rivers with their sweeping bends, winding through the marshy fields...Moreover, let the water always search for the lowest level and, to heighten the artistic effect, build sea-towns stretching up to higher grounds...' Rather than invent the castles on cliff-tops which van Mander then describes, van Ruysdael has placed the belfry of the Grote Kerk nearly in the centre of the horizon line to provide a dominant vertical against the streaky sky, lightest where, in van Mander's words, it meets 'the heavy element of earth'.Set on the River Ijssel in the eastern province of Overijssel, Deventer is far from the sea, and the vessels flying the Dutch flag and tacking into the wind are proceeding upriver, inland. Yet van Ruysdael lends this commonplace view of commercial shipping the epic quality of a voyage on the open seas. Their sails silhouetted against the sky, the ships move in a diagonal line, outlined by a patch of marshy land and brightly lit as cloud shadows fall across the foreground. This diagonal, which leads our eyes to a vanishing point on the horizon, is reinforced by the receding shoreline on the right. It is an astonishingly bold and dynamic effect within the modest scope of the picture. Although three-quarters of its surface is taken up with sky, the focus of attention is on human achievement: stone-built church towers, mills harnessing the power of the wind, heroic sailing ships, fishermen hauling on their net - not least, the making of art from these everyday ingredients, with no picturesque motifs to frame the composition or stand between us and the flat waters and sandy ground
