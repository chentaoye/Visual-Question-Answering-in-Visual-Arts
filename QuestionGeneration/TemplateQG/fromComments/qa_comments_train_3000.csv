29363-0view1.jpg	The Strozzi Chapel contains one of the most important altarpieces of the Trecento, painted by Orcagna (Andrea di Cione) between 1354 and 1357. The frescoes in the chapel were probably painted at the same time as the retable by Nardo di Cione, the brother of Orcagna.In nearly a complete departure from earlier family chapels, the fresco program is devoted almost exclusively to a depiction of the Last Judgment, which takes up all three walls. The pictorial program of the frescoes is articulated like a triptych, with the Last Judgment on the west wall as the core of the ensemble and Paradise on the south wall as the pendant to Hell on the north wall.The picture shows the Strozzi Chapel from the east. On the west wall is the Last Judgment, on the south wall (left) the Paradise, on the north wall (right) the Hell can be seen.The figures in the stained glass window are the Madonna and Child, and the Dominican Saint Thomas Aquinas

09321-atalanta.jpg	In the Boeotian version of the legend, followed by Ovid (Met. 10:560-707), Atalanta was an athletic huntress. Her way with her suitors was to challenge them to a race in which the loser was punished with death. She remained unbeaten and a virgin until Hippomenes (elsewhere named Melanion) took her on. As they ran he dropped three golden apples, given to him by Venus, and since Atalanta could not resist stopping to pick them up she lost the race.  They later made love in a temple of Cybele, which offended the goddess so much that she turned them both into lions.In the picture Atalanta is shown in the act of stooping to pick up an apple as Hippomenes overtakes her. Colombel's Atalanta is clearly inspired by the woman in Guido Reni's famous painting of the same subject in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. Both are shown in profile with their athletic right arms reaching out for the apple. Less frantic, however, Colombel's stately figure is more decidedly Poussinesque.

Edmund Tarbell was one of the first to take this direction. His compositions of the 1890s, showing stylish ladies at leisure out of doors. The choice of theme was mainly responsible for Tarbell's popularity with affluent collectors in Boston. His influence and reputation were also consolidated by years of teaching at the Boston Museum School. People even talked of Tarbellites - that is other Bostonian figure painters whose technique and approach to their subject-matter betrayed an affinity with his presiding spirit.

03939-triptic4.jpg	The church Santa Maria della Carit&#224; in Venice was reconstructed in the middle of the 15th century. Various chapels were erected between 1460 and 1464 by noble families. Four chapels were decorated by altarpieces which are now associated with Jacopo Bellini and his sons: the St Sebastian Triptych in the St Sebastian Chapel; the St Lawrence Triptych in the Chapel of Lorenzo Dolfin; the Nativity Triptych in the Chapel of Andrea da Molin; the Madonna Triptych in the Chapel of Giacomo Zorzi. The four triptychs can still be seen in the church of the Carit&#224;, for which they were painted, now incorporated into the Gallerie dell'Accademia. The Nativity Triptych consists of a lunette (60 x 166 cm) representing the Trinity between Sts Augustin and Dominic; the left panel (127 x 48 cm) representing St Francis; the central panel (103 x 45 cm) representing the nativity; the right panel (127 x 48 cm) representing S Victor.The influence of Mantegna and Donatello is evident in the lunette. Here the figures stand out clearly on the gold ground, now devoid of all transcendental significance, respecting laws of perspective and symmetry as well as of tone and colour, bathing the central panel in light. The subject of the central panel recalls a work of 1447 by Vivarini, now in the Prague National Gallery.

22765-venus_mi.jpg	"Reared in the Dutch and Flemish school, a disciple of Hendrick Goltzius, Liss absorbed a wide variety of experiences in his youth; he acquired at the Haarlem school his zest for the popular approach to portraiture, with glowing colours and firmly clean-cut forms.Coming to Venice in 1621, he probably met Feti, whose influence mellowed his painting and made for more richly-modulated colouring and light. The material has a fresh look, and is edged with ""frills"", thus ushering in the first dawning of the Baroque in Venice.The Venus is a product of the artist's maturity from his Venetian period, which saw his attention turning from the genre scene towards themes of mythological inspiration. The sway and spell of his predecessors' artistry, in particular that of Veronese, as bred by the Venetian milieu is still there; but there is also a foretaste of that bucolic mythologizing which was a prelude to Sebastiano Ricc's pictorial ""symphonies"". The work is a link, then not only in the world of Venetian art, but in the painting of the whole of Central Europe.The toilet of Venus is a timeless theme of sensuous seduction.

It is an excellent example of her keen sense for the erotic and the sensuous.

22183-delaware.jpg	This famous event from the American Revolution was painted by German-born Emanuel Leutze, who spent most of his life in the United States. He painted the first version of this picture (destroyed in World War II) in D�sseldorf, where a school of Romantic painting flourished, and immediately painted a second version - this picture - which was sent to America and exhibited throughout the country. A print published in 1853 gave the painting the status of a national monument, in spite of numerous errors in historical detail (the flag, for example, as depicted here was not introduced until six months after the event).

43945-1deposit.jpg	"The earliest painting that can be ascribed to Rogier van der Weyden with any certainty is also the artist's greatest and most influential extant work: the great Deposition. It cannot have been painted very long after 1435, the year established by dendrochronological dating methods, which would also fit the circumstances of Rogier's life at the time. On the other hand, it must have been painted before 1443, the date of the earliest copy (in the Sint-Pieterskerk, Leuven). The Deposition was an altarpiece, intended for the chapel of the Confraternity of the Archers of Leuven, who commissioned it. (The two small crossbows in the lower spandrels of the tracery in the picture refer to the Confraternity.). Mary of Hungary (1505-1558), Regent of the Netherlands, acquired the painting from the Archers of Leuven before 1548. Later it came into the possession of her nephew King Philip II of Spain (1527-1598; king from 1556), who finally placed it in the monastery fortress of the Escorial he had founded near Madrid. At that time the Deposition formed the centre of a triptych, but there is no indication that the side wings were originally part of the work, it is more likely that the Deposition was originally a single panel.At about 2.2 meters high and 2.6 meters wide, the painting is very large by the usual standards of Early Netherlandish pictures; in terms of concept it is truly monumental. Ten figures in all cover the painted surface almost entirely, with their heads close to the upper edge of the panel. The body of Jesus has already been removed from the Cross, and is received by two elderly men, the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus. Surrounded by Jesus's mourning friends they are holding His dead body for a moment before setting it down. Mary is sinking to the ground in a faint beside her son, and is supported by John, the favourite disciple of Jesus, and by one of the holy women. On the extreme right, the despairing Mary Magdalene seems on the brink of collapse.The scene shown would have lasted for only a moment, but there is nothing momentary about its depiction, which is quite detached from the historical event. Rogier achieves this effect principally by placing the group in a painted niche like an altar shrine; the hill of Golgotha, the Place of Skulls where the Cross stood, is suggested only by skulls and arm bones on the narrow strip of stone floor. A connection is thus established with those gilded shrines holding painted statues that were a particularly costly and lavish form of retable. However, Rogier was not imitating a carved altar. He shows ""live"" figures rather than statues, and the life-like effect is emphasized by their appearance, almost life-size, in the place where mere wooden statues would be expected in an altar. Using such methods, Rogier gives them the three-dimensionality of statues but the look of a painting, which is much more life-like than sculpture.However, such considerations would have played only a minor part in Rogier's decision to set the scene in the painted altar niche. His primary concern was to emphasize the forcefulness of the depiction. Rogier even departs deliberately from what can be rationally imagined, and so breaks with the manner of realistic spatial depiction that had only recently been achieved in painting. The niche he paints is deep enough at the bottom of the picture to accommodate several figures, the upright of the Cross, and the ladder leaning against it; but in some areas at the top it seems to come close to the surface of the picture - the helper on the ladder is pressed tightly into the shallow upper space of the shrine, while the head of the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea just below seems to protrude from the picture. All the figures are brought forward by the golden back wall so that the space surrounds them closely: convincing as their actions may look individually, there would never really have been room for them all. The result is a sense of timelessness and an almost oppressive intensity.The painted niche offered Rogier another advantage: he could retain the gold background usual in medieval painting without offending against the demands of naturalistic depiction. The background of the painting is, in fact, a real gilded surface and also a pictorial representation of one - the back of the shrine.Rogier relates the figures to each other in a masterly composition, yet he emphasizes a number of different accents. The limp body of Christ is at the centre, and appears to be held quite naturally by the two men so that it is almost facing the observer, with hardly anything else encroaching on it. This is the part of the picture intended to inspire the greatest reverence, referring to the sacrament in which, in the Catholic faith, the host and the wine become the body and blood of Christ. During divine service the bread and wine would have stood on the altar below this picture, and when the priest raised the host above his head during the ceremony, the congregation would have seen him doing so directly in front of the painted body of Christ.The almost radiant body is immaculate and beautiful, undisfigured by the marks of scourging, and its delicate but almost swelling form has a distinctly sensuous softness. Only the marks of the five wounds are ugly gashes running with blood. However, the long trickle from the wound in Christ's side passes over the body like a delicate line that traces the curve of the stomach.The other main character in the picture is Mary. The Mother of God, sinking to the ground as if dead, forms a parallel to Christ, allowing the artist to create a link between the two main groups in a bold effect of composition, since they are moving in different directions: Christ is being carried away to the right, while Mary is falling to the left. At the same time, the correspondence between the figures illustrates an important theological idea of the time Mary's own compassionate suffering and her part in Christ's act of redemption. On the right of the picture not directly involved in the action, stands Mary Magdalene. Her magnificent, worldly garments, with the low-necked dress showing her full, sensuous breasts, indicate that she is the ""great sinner"" who has abandoned her depraved way of life and turned to Christ in repentance. In terms of composition, the Magdalene's figure closes off the picture on the right like a large bracket, matching the similarly bowed figure of John on the left. The curve of Mary Magdalene's cloak, sweeping forward into the picture, is echoed by the hem of the brocade robe worn by Nicodemus, and is continued in the left half of the picture by the folds in the Virgin Mary's blue dress. Such overlapping forms and lines determine the structure of the whole picture: the curve of Christ's body is continued in the Magdalene's left arm, and is crossed by the diagonal running in the opposite direction from the eyes of Nicodemus, through the hands of Christ and Mary, to the eye sockets of the skull. Christ's left arm too echoes the movements that seem to curve and turn on each other at the centre of the picture.The Deposition is among the outstanding masterpieces of Netherlandish art, and one of the mainstays of Rogier's fame. As the work of a painter aged 35 to 40, it can hardly be described as a youthful production, yet only with this painting can we begin to see Rogier more clearly as an artistic personality. Most important of all, the picture shows unmistakable similarities with some of the major works of the Master of Fl�malle"

24926-annunci.jpg	The effect of the altarpiece on the northern wall of this church is liable to bring spectators to a sudden stop. They will find themselves looking into the interior of a monumental Gothic church, painted in masterly perspective. Their glance will follow the long row of columns disappearing into the distance of the nave until it reaches the small figures at the very end. The capitals of the columns are splendidly carved; upon two of them stand statues of prophets below small canopies. The small figures stand out in gay colours against the grey tones of the architecture. The Virgin kneels before a Gothic lectern, her red velvet robe almost concealed by the spreading folds of a mantle of gold brocade; the purple dalmatic of the angel of the Annunciation is edged with a border adorned with figures. On the balcony of the church vestibule God the Father appears, accompanied by two angels, radiating a beam of light on to Mary

26593-08_3ce8.jpg	The second scene in the chronological order of the narrative, the Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Plants, is depicted in the large field of the vault of the eighth bay, between the triangular spandrels.In this scene the figure of the Lord appears twice: on the right, as he is about to give shape, with his outstretched arms, to the incandescent disk of the sun and the cold one of the moon; and, on the other side, as, with an imperious gesture, he summons forth tufts of grass and the first bushes from the bare earth. The scene is divided unequally: the great disk of the sun - the only element of colour that stands out clearly from the more subdued tones of the clothes, flesh, and the greyish white background of the sky - is to the left of the central axis of the field, and the whole of the right part is dominated by the figure of the Creator who, surrounded by four children, moves impetuously toward the viewer.On the left, in a more restricted field, and further back from the picture plane, the Creator is depicted once again - notably foreshortened and seen from behind - as he heads toward the earth, going away from the foreground. Together with the strong contrasts of light and shade, the movement in opposite directions of the two figures heightens the dynamic tension of the scene and conveys a sense of immediacy			
44096-6medici.jpg	This Sacra Conversazione may have been painted in 1450, the year in which Rogier visited Rome. Iconographical details indicate that it was probably commissioned by the Medici family (Saints Cosmas and Damian on the left were the Medici's patron saints, and a modified Florentine lily appears in the coat of arms). The painting is known as the Medici Madonna.The composition, in which the figures are grouped in a stepped, semicircular arrangement whose gentle curve is restated in the upper arch of the frame, may have been inspired by Domenico Veneziano's St Lucy altarpiece. A comparison of the two works nevertheless also reveals the fundamental differences between Flemish and Florentine painting around the middle of the 15th century. Rogier's figures stand close together; in comparison to Domenico's distinctly separate figures, Peter and John here appear directly connected. Their proportions are elongated (compare, for example, the two Johns) and they are given solidity more by the outlines of their robes than by the organic structure of their bodies.In the precision and texturing of his details, on the other hand, as seen in the plants and vase in the foreground, the glass bottle in St Cosmas' hand, and the sumptuous damask inside the tent-like baldachin, Rogier introduced his Florentine contemporaries to what must have been a whole new experience of painting.Italian clients valued the painting of the Netherlandish artist, so different from the ideals of Renaissance art, for its delicacy and for the artist's ability to capture the material nature of objects realistically in oils (particularly when painting shimmering light and reflections). They also admired his convincing depiction of human moods and emotions

38607-peas_dan.jpg	Teniers was born in Antwerp and was taught by his father. He was received as a Master of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp in 1632/3, becoming its Dean in 1645/6, and in 1663 he became a founder member of the city's Acad�mie Royale. For many years from 1651 Teniers worked in Brussels for the Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, Archduke Leopold-Wilhelm, and subsequently for his successor as Governor, Don Juan of Austria. Apart from his paintings, Teniers's duties as art adviser to Archduke Leopold-Wilhelm are best seen in the publication Theatrum pictorium of 1660, an illustrated catalogue of part of the Archduke's collection. Teniers made many of the small preparatory painted copies, prior to engraving (there are some in the Royal Collection and several in the Courtauld Gallery, London), and oversaw the etchings for the catalogue. He spent five years in England from 1650 to 1655, apparently buying paintings as part of his activities as a dealer. Teniers was a man of considerable wealth, purchasing a country estate in 1662 and finally being ennobled in 1680. His first marriage was to Anne, the daughter of Jan Brueghel the Elder, but she died in 1656.The painting, which would appear to date from the mid- or late 1640s, is essentially a genre scene of a type that had been pioneered by painters like Jan Brueghel the Elder, Frans Francken II and David Vinckboons. The broad characterisation of peasant types by Teniers is to some extent derived from Adriaen Brouwer, but the squat proportions of the figures, with their large heads and big feet, are typical of the artist's style. Not all the figures, however, are peasants. The couple in the left foreground, accompanied by a child and a dog, are bourgeois types. So too is the woman nearby being helped to her feet. Dress and coiffure suggest social distinctions that may give the painting extra meaning.The inn in the left half of the composition occurs again in a painting in Dresden, but the general layout of the composition with buildings on the left, a tree with or without a fence marking the centre, and a distant view on the right is a well-established format in Teniers's work. Otherwise it is the range of observation and contrasting actions that holds the attention. The bagpiper leaning against the tree, the man vomiting, the man near the centre leaning on his stick, the dancers, the woman looking out of the window of the inn are all memorable figures in a painting of varied emotions and changing rhythms. The figure helping the woman to her feet anticipates Watteau, who was a keen admirer of Teniers. Genre, landscape and still life are all combined in this composition, which provides abundant proof of the artist's skills.

18039-51angel.jpg	In contrast to iconographical tradition, Gozzoli has not depicted the arrival of the procession but shows the events in the chronological order in which they happened in the biblical account of Christmas: the corner pilasters flanking the choir separate the earthly procession from the heavenly sphere of the angels. The angels - unrecognised by the humans - are paying homage to the Christ Child on the altar painting, while the Three Kings are still travelling and the shepherds in the fields are yet to experience the annunciation of the birth.			
11317-505delac.jpg	As the acknowledged master of monumental civic decoration, Delacroix could afford to stand aside from one of the major enterprises of his time, the decoration of religious monuments. But the Saints-Anges chapel at the church of Saint-Sulpice provided the opportunity for a kind of last testament. By a decree dated 28 April, 1849, Delacroix was commissioned to decorate a chapel at Saint-Sulpice. However, the urgent demands made by his numerous civic commissions and the doubtful state of his health hindered him fulfilling the decree. Only twelve years later, in 1861, did he complete the chapel. Given that it was consecrated to the Holy Angels, Delacroix chose to represent Saint Michael Defeats the Devil on the ceiling, and Jacob Wrestling with the Angel and Heliodorus Driven from the Temple on the walls. Now badly weakened by illness, he relied heavily on the help of his faithful assistants, Pierre Andrieu and Louis Boulange.This time there was no critical consensus. There was praise for the delicate gradation of tones in the Heliodorus, which was compared to Veronese and Raphael, while Michelangelo was cited in relation to the muscular brutality of Jacob. But contemporary critics were blind to Delacroix's originality in replacing the traditional architectural background with a natural landscape. His very rich and various palette, the harmony of the colours, and, in particular, the subtlety of the greens in the foliage, prefigure the work of Corot. Delacroix here shows himself the father of Impressionism. Jacob Wrestling with the Angel has been read as a summary of Delacroix's life and work. Indeed the leitmotif of his career is the struggle - a spiritual combat - between his aspiration to classicism and his Romantic genius, between his admiration for Racine and his love of Shakespeare.

Vermeer seems to have painted a number of ""heads,"" and various cited 'tronie', as they were called, cannot be further identified. We only know for certain that the work was purchased at the beginning of 1882 for the collection A. A. des Tombe of The Hague for fl. 2.30 in the sale Braam of the same city. The des Tombe collection was a public collection and bequeathed the picture in 1903 to the Mauritshuis.This charming portrait of a girl is unfortunately in a very poor state of conservation and suffered from numerous extensive restorations. It is furthermore marred by an ugly pattern of cracks. Nevertheless, it became famous after its rediscovery and was dubbed the ""Gioconda of the North"" by many enthusiastic critics. Fortunately, enough of the original is left to permit the savouring of a truly outstanding and partly exotic work.The girl is seen against a neutral, dark background, very nearly black, which establishes a powerful three-dimensionality of effect. Seen from the side, the girl is turning to gaze at us, and her lips are slightly parted, as if she were about to speak to us. It is an illusionist approach often adopted in Dutch art. She is inclining her head slightly to one side as if lost in thought, yet her gaze is keen.The girl is dressed in an unadorned, brownish-yellow jacket, and the shining white collar contrasts clearly against it. The blue turban represents a further contrast, while a lemon-yellow, veil-like cloth falls from its peak to her shoulders. Vermeer used plain, pure colours in this painting, limiting the range of tones. As a result, the number of sections of colour are small, and these are given depth and shadow by the use of varnish of the same colour.The girl's headdress has an exotic effect. Turbans were a popular fashionable accessory in Europe as early as the 15th century, as is shown by Jan van Eyck's probable self portrait, now in the National Gallery in London. During the wars against the Turks, the remote way of life and foreign dress of the ""enemy of Christendom"" proved to be very fascinating. A particularly noticeable feature of Vermeer's painting is the large, tear-shaped pearl hanging from the girl's ear; part of it has a golden sheen, and it stands out from the part of the neck which is in shadow.In his Introduction to the Devout Life (1608), which was published in a Dutch translation in 1616, the mystic St Francis De Sales (1567-1622) wrote, ""Both now and in the past it has been customary for women to hang pearls from their ears; as Pliny observed, they gain pleasure from the sensation of the swinging pearls touching them. But I know that God's friend, Isaac, sent earrings to chaste Rebecca as a first token of his love. This leads me to think that this jewel has a spiritual meaning, namely that the first part of the body that a man wants, and which a woman must loyally protect, is the ear; no word or sound should enter it other than the sweet sound of chaste words, which are the oriental pearls of the gospel.""From this it is clear that the pearl in Vermeer's painting is a symbol of chastity. The oriental aspect, which is mentioned in the above extract, is further emphasised by the turban. The reference to Isaac and Rebecca suggests that this picture could have been painted on the occasion of this young woman's marriage. So to that extent it is a portrait.There is surely a similar explanation for the Head of a Girl dressed in a smart, grey dress (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). One must admire the artist's technique, which features application of the pigments in juxtaposition and melting, avoiding precise lines, and therefore blurring the contours of different colours so as to obtain effects that foreshadow those of the impressionists. The dark backgrounds that Vermeer chose in these two portraits enhance the plasticity of the models"

17930-beach_sc.jpg	In 1646 van Goyen made numerous drawings of Scheveningen, a fishing town on the North Sea coast, which he then used for paintings. His lively beach painting still offers the impression of spontaneous transcription, but he dramatized his drawings by raising the dunes and accentuating the cloud pattern. Most astounding is the apparent veracity of light filtered through packed clouds. Van Goyen's rather monochrome drawings could only approximate such a life-like atmosphere, and he must have created it in the studio from a remembered, mental image. Such painting, from the mind, was considered at least as important as drawing from life

35867-philemon.jpg	Philemon and Baucis was an old couple who, according to Ovid (Met. 8:621-96) once gave hospitality in their humble cottage to two travellers who had been turned away from other, richer houses. During supper, to the hosts' astonishment, the wine bowl miraculously replenished itself; their only goose, which they would have killed for the occasion, flew to the visitors for refuge. Jupiter and Mercury, for it was they, then revealed themselves to Philemon and Baucis, and took them up to the mountainside where they observed that the whole country was covered with flood waters, except for the cottage which had been changed into a temple. Granted a wish by Jupiter, the old man and woman chose to be priests of the temple. At their death they were changed into an oak and a lime tree.

16998-nuenen13.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 164, JH 558.In December 1884 van Gogh set himself the task of painting and drawing a large series of portraits of the peasants in Brabant. In this group of works he did not want to portray individuals but sought to characterize a type: the peasant. Rather than seeking beauty, he was looking for models that had rough, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips.The models he depicted were shown in traditional dress, and the painter focused in particular on their heads, rarely introducing extra details. For the present portrait he chose a young man smoking a pipe. He is dressed in a blue jacket with his white shirt showing at the throat. The flesh colours of the face are brightened by touches of red on cheek and lips. Also the glowing bowl of the pipe adds a little liveliness to the otherwise dark picture

He saw that pastels struck a balance between painting and drawing, enabling him to paint while drawing.

18335-1402grec.jpg	A late version of the subject treated twice in his Italian years. The scene is restricted to the main group, which follows almost exactly that of the original design of some forty years back, which in its turn used a Michelangelo design. A greater expressive force is attained by this concentration in the one group, and is infinitely enhanced by the vitality of the colour and handling. The disturbing effect of the empty space on the right of his earlier versions, and of the recessional perspective of the tiled pavement and the vista through the arch has been eliminated. The three-dimensional character of the figures and space is not described: the event alone is expressed, and creates its own space. The composition includes, on the right-hand side, a woman carrying a basket on her head and gesturing with her hand. Her identity and significance have not been satisfactorily explained.The episodal type of subject is unusual for El Greco in Spain - he does not repeat the Christ healing the Blind, the possible sequel to this event. The subject was, of course, of special relevance to the age of the Counter-Reformation. In any event, El Greco has raised it above the merely dogmatic or episodal. The Venetian motif of the reclining female figure of the early versions has been substituted by the male figure bending down, which may be a recollection from Raphael's tapestry cartoon of the Miraculous Draught of Fishes. The reliefs to the left and right of the arch represent the Expulsion from Paradise, an Old Testament parallel of the Expulsion from the Temple, and the Sacrifice of Isaac, less easily connected with the subject. In this late version, El Greco has introduced the overthrown 'tables of the moneylenders and the seats of those who sold doves' (St Matthew XXI, 12).A number of late versions exist, of which the National Gallery painting is the finest example. The splendid small version in the Frick Collection, New York, is probably the study for the larger painting

18178-musicalc.jpg	The vogue for pictures of musicians and drinkers started in the early 1620s, when both Honthorst and Terbrugghen began to turn out many of them. During the twenties pictures of this type had a direct influence on the genre paintings Hals did in Haarlem, it is to Terbrugghen that Hals probably owes the biggest debt.None of Hals's half-length genre pictures datable to the twenties bears a firm date. However, this Musical Trio is securely monogrammed and dated by the Haarlem artist Pieter de Grebber. Its debt to Utrecht Caravaggism is unmistakable in the types, gestures, and hidden artificial light source de Grebber used in his painting. It firmly establishes that the innovations made by the Utrecht Caravaggisti found their way to Haarlem as early as 1623. How did they get there so quickly. Perhaps Jacob van Campen (1595-1667) was the conduit. Although Campen secure position in the history of Dutch art rests on his work as an architect, he was also a painter and his early activity as one is part of the story of painting in Utrecht.

23414-adoratio.jpg	This Adoration of the Magi employs a conventional composition, however, it is also a good example of the evolution taking place in painting in the second half of the 14th century, especially in Italy, towards a closer imitation of nature, in a desire to represent reality. Thus, while the landscape is indicated in no more than conventional shorthand and is compositionally subordinate to the main scene, located in the immediate foreground, the artist has succeeded in creating a sense of real space between the figures, who are also depicted in more or less naturalistic proportion. This sense of three-dimensional space is achieved in the foreground through the arrangement of the Virgin's robe, the two angels on the right (who are modelled with great skill and harmony both in their colouring and volumes), and the empty spaces. We see a real ground and can appreciate how Joseph, situated in a second plane further back, contributes to the impression of depth.The painting illustrates how, in their striving towards the imitation of nature along the path to the Renaissance, artists first conquered the representation of the human body. Since the primary aim of painting was still to relate stories, mainly religious ones, landscape and other elements of secondary importance served simply as the backdrop to the principal events

39699-05sacre0.jpg	Sacred and Profane Love, Titian's masterpiece, was painted when he was about twenty-five to celebrate the marriage of the Venetian Nicol&#242; Aurelio (coat of arms on the sarcophagus) and Laura Bagarotto in 1514. The bride dressed in white sitting beside Cupid is assisted by Venus in person. The figure with the vase of jewels symbolizes `fleeting happiness on earth' and the one bearing the burning flame of God's love symbolizes `eternal happiness in heaven'. The title is the result of a late 18th-century interpretation of the painting, which gives a moralistic reading of the nude figure, whereas the artist intended this to be an exaltation of both earthly and heavenly love. In fact in the Neoplatonic philosophy that Titian and his circle believed in contemplating the beauty of the creation led to an awareness of the divine perfection of the order of the cosmos.In this painting of love in the open countryside Titian has surpassed the delicate lyrical poetry of Giovanni Bellini or Giorgione and attributes a classical grandeur to his figures. In 1899, the Rothschilds offered to buy this world famous work at a price that was higher than the estimated value of the Villa Borghese and all its works of art (4,000,000 Lire as opposed to 3,600,000 Lire) . However, Titian's Sacred and Profane Love has remained and virtually become the symbol of the Borghese Gallery itself

It shows Thomas kneeling in a religious rapture before a crucified Christ, flanked by St Catherine of Alexandria and the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, and St John, who seem to have moved out of the painting depicted on the walls of the niche behind them into physical space.

36132-stillife.jpg	Sanchez Cotan studied in Toledo and here he established the prototype of the Spanish still-life composed mainly from vegetables.Everyday objects: a melon, cut open to reveal its pale pink flesh, a knobby cucumber, a yellow quince that is past its best, a cabbage with thick leaves. Parallel to the picture plane, a smooth frame delineates the opening for a window. From the direction of the spectator, light falls upon the parapet, on which the slice of melon and the cucumber are placed so that they jut over slightly and thereby they seem to be almost within reach - a trompe l'oeil effect that was particularly popular in Netherlandish painting in the 17th century. The head of cabbage and the quince, suspended on threads that presumably have been attached to the upper frame, are dangling over the gaping darkness.Even if the objects are arranged so that they seem close enough to touch, they are nevertheless distanced. For all the naturalism with which they are depicted, the isolation of each object, heightened further by the black background, makes each of them seem extremely artificial and lends them a monumental, almost sculptural gravity. The centre of the picture is empty and the arrangement seems coincidental; the dimension of the painted picture is denied. The disturbing evocation of the painted picture is the main theme

Munk�csy's nerves were shattered at that time: he was afraid that he would not be able to paint any more. Passionate experiences vanished but he had other subject  matters to concentrate on. The contours of houses in this picture indicate a German town. The major figure in fetters is Hungarian, he looks like Munk�csy's tramp. Embarressment on the faces and in the gestures of market women is so lively as if Munk�csy painted a genre-picture and characters in the country in Hungary.The mother, another well-known figure from his pictures, embraces her child protectively. The red-haired man with a hump is raising his eyebrows and is trying to find out what is going on.

32315-13landsc.jpg	Poussin in old age was the grand old man of French painters in Rome. Esteemed by all and collected by discerning connoisseurs, he was revered as the man who had elevated painting to a much more serious plane than many of his Italian contemporaries, whose stature was often that of a decorator. In the early 1660s, however, a great change, which has to be described as a totally new phase, came over Poussin's art. Only a few pictures from this period survive, the earliest of which is probably the Landscape with Diana and Orion.The change is in the completely different handling of paint, which shows his preoccupation with surface texture, and a relaxation of mood. His sense of severity and order has disappeared and been replaced by a mood much more akin to the last works of Titian, such as the Diana and Actaeon in the National Gallery, London. In the New York picture the forms are less rigid than previously, and there is a return to the sense of rhythm last seen in his work of the 1630s. The landscape becomes a much more sensual interpretation of such types of painting as the Diogenes.In Greek mythology Orion was a hunter of gigantic stature. Drunk with wine he once tried to rape a princess of Chios, but her father punished Orion by blinding him. An oracle told him to travel east to the furthest edge of the world where the rays of the rising sun would heal his sight. On his journey he passed the forge of Vulcan whence he carried off an apprentice named Cedalion to guide him on his way. In due course Orion's sight was restored.Poussin shows the giant, bow in hand, striding through a wooded countryside towards a distant sea. Cedalion perches on his shoulders. Vulcan stands at the roadside pointing out the way. A cloud, wafting round Orion's face, suggests that his sight is veiled. Another myth tells how Orion eventually died at the hand of Diana who set his image among the stars. She is seen floating above him

07959-farnes03.jpg	In 1597 Cardinal Odoardo Farnese commissioned Annibale Carracci's great masterpiece, the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese in the Palazzo Farnese, the most splendid and influential ceiling decoration in Rome since that of the Sistine Chapel. Annibale's brother Agostino assisted him on at least two of the scenes until they quarrelled and Agostino left Rome. In contrast to the earlier interpretation which saw them as a Neoplatonic allegory of the victory of Celestial Love over physical passion, in recent years Annibale's frescoes have generally been regarded as a witty and joyous celebration of the classical gods in love.During the 1570s and 1580s fresco cycles with mythological subjects had been relatively unfashionable in Rome, since the climate of the Counter Reformation favoured religious decoration, even in secular buildings such as palaces and villas. It may be a measure of the Catholic Church's confidence in winning the battle for souls that it could increasingly tolerate such overtly erotic decoration, even in a cardinal's palace, albeit in what was probably one of the more private rooms. Besides celebrating love's power to conquer, it is likely that the frescoes were intended to complement the antique statues, some of the finest in one of Rome's most magnificent collection of antiquities, which were displayed there

15938-singer.jpg	The famous Singers (The Impassioned Singer and its companion-piece, The Singer with Flute) in the Borghese Gallery were attributed to Giorgione. However, this attribution is strongly debated. Some scholars think it to be the work of Domenico Capriolo (1494-1528), others assume that it was executed in the period following the death of Giorgione. The singers sing with an air of Baroque pathos surrounded by strong chiaroscuro effects, which in fact have induced many experts today to date them to the beginning of the 17th century

13635-12ferenc.jpg	"""An Evening in March"" portrays landscape in a realistic fashion. Yet Ferenczy's picture contains more than meets the eye: it is not only orthodox churches and white stone-walls, but the peaceful atmosphere of a town in sunshine, nature preparing for spring, the fragrence of cool air and the azure of the sky in Nagyb�nya: a late afternoon in May. It is surprisingly new what takes place in this picture: this is the very moment when sunshine appears in Ferenczy's painting, it is not sunshine glimmering through leaves but warm brightness flooding the picture. The twilight makes everything, stone-walls, trees, people and animals more colourful. There are long dark shadows stretching only along the earth in the foreground and the silhouettes of carriages are sharply projected on the white stone-wall as if figures of a shadow theatre. Ferenczy  again composed a picture: the long stone-wall and the Fekete-hill behind  it make up a long horizontal strip which runs along the picture-plane in the middle of it. The old birch tree on the left and the vertical form of the church tower make them a solid composition.This composition consists of  light and shadow besides forms and lines. The boundary of the horizontal line in the middle is drawn by light and shadow. The dark, shadowy foreground finds its counterpoint in colour and form in the bright sky. The monotony of the stone-wall is broken by carriages and their shadows. The counterpoint of the church and the church tower can be found in branches of pussy willows  with the bright azure of the sky glimmering through.It is largely due to the strong contrasts of light and shadow that it was lithographed (in fact, it was the only lithograph that was made on the basis of Ferenczy's works), although he simplified the composition for this purpose, made the contrast of dark and light stronger and light and shadow were contrasted in more homogeneous surfaces"

29938-drinker.jpg	Adriaen van Ostade, a native of Haarlem, is said to have been a pupil of Frans Hals. Certainly one can see the master's influence in his choice of subjects and in his approach, particularly in his early work, but he created an artistic idiom of his own and his development was essentially individual. He painted genre-scenes, recording the lives of ordinary Dutch townsfolk and peasants; in his pictures we see the interiors of cottages and poor village schools, crowded taverns and workshops. But he often depicted single figures as well: everyday characters such as the baker, the fishmonger or the barber-surgeon. Market scenes were a favourite subject of his.

The point of the game was that the players had to stay within a certain distance of each other - as can be seen from the picture, the right foot of one participant having to touch the other's left"

07139-flowers1.jpg	In the pair of flower pieces, now in the Prado, the bouquets are arranged in two identical gilt vases resting on a long wooden table in an unspecified interior space. Unlike the stone ledges and rocky outcrops favoured by contemporary flower painters in Madrid, the plain wooden tabletop, which had also been used in the still-life paintings of Francisco de Zurbar�n, was a favourite means of support in the flower pieces of Camprob�n. Pink, white and red roses predominate in the centre of the compositions and are accompanied by irises, lilies and carnations, with generous amounts of foliage punctuating the spaces between the blooms. Flowers spill out around the vases and hang down almost to meet the loose blooms resting on the tabletop, that include a branch of lilies and a sprig of orange blossom. The finesse and attention to detail with which Camprob�n depicted flowers is epitomised by the few loose leaves and fallen petals that he carefully depicted on the wooden table, motifs that also suggest that the flowers were in the fullness of their bloom.

38251-annunc.jpg	"At the age of seventeen the Genoese Bernardo Strozzi became a Capuchin monk (hence his nicknames of ""Il Capucino"" or ""Il Prete Genovese""), but in 1610 he left his convent in order to tto support his mother and sister by his work as a painter. When the former died and the latter married he was recalled by his order but disobeyed and, to escape imprisonment, fled to Venice where he spent the rest of his life. Influenced to some extent by the painters of Venice but mainly by Caravaggio and Rubens, Strozzi was a versatile and extraordinarily prolific artist, whose work comprises nearly every kind of painting - frescoes, altarpieces, genre scenes and portraits. His approach was natural and robust, his forms vigorous and his colours warm, even fiery. The Annunciation was painted during his late Venetian period"

26157-39dipty.jpg	The left panel of the diptych represents the Deposition, while the right the Weeping Women.There is an older variant of this composition, whose wings are now in a private collection and the Museu de Arte, S&#227;o Paulo. Despite its ruinous state, it also seems to be autograph.In terms of its iconography, the composition is a conflation of a Lamentation and a Deposition. By focusing in on the body as it is descended from the Cross, the scene loses its general anecdotal character and takes on instead a similar contemplative function to a Lamentation or Piet&#224; on the ground. The panels are conceived as a spatial unit with a continuous landscape. The cropping of the figures along the boundary between the two panels must have been filled in and compensated for by the now missing frame. The overall effect is thus that of a realistic close-up with a devotional function. The body of Christ in the New York-S&#227;o Paulo diptych is cut of above the knees and there are only two Holy Women in addition to Mary Magdalene. In the Granada version, Christ is shown to below his knees, his arms hanging over the shoulders of Joseph of Arimathea on the left and Nicodemus on the right, and there are three Holy Women present. There are further differences between the gestures, head movements and types. An instructive comparison can be made with a similar diptych on canvas, which is attributed to Hugo van der Goes. Careful comparison reveals that Memling drew upon Van der Goes particularly for the first diptych. There are also borrowings from the lost Deposition by the Master of Fl�malle, which was installed in St James' Church in Bruges. Memling thus created a new type by merging the compositions of the Master of Fl�malle and Hugo van der Goes

17230-4earlie1.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 483, JH 1793.In August and September 1888, van Gogh executed four paintings depicting sunflowers in a vase. He intended to decorate a room in the house, the so-called Yellow House, that he rent in Arles. He also painted a portrait of his bedroom in the Yellow House as part of the projected decoration of the house with works which would show Gauguin what he had been doing.Powerful effects of immediacy and invitation were achieved in the painting by the deviation from rigorous geometric perspective. The spatial effect of the relationship between the objects in the painting and the position in which we as spectators are placed has been perceptively described as 'phenomenological space', that is, spatial relations as we experience and remember them rather than as they are conventionally represented in paintings made according to the geometric perspective systems used by artists since the Renaissance. Thus, in addition to exploiting the expressive possibilities of colour, van Gogh was investigating the expressive possibilities of new representations of space.This copy of the first version was executed one year later in Saint-R�my

06982-01floor.jpg	Caillebotte was especially interested in light in the open, and fleeting impressions of a kind hitherto not considered proper subjects, while he was drawn thematically to human figures and aspects of urban life. His view of Impressionist realism was closest to that of Degas, however, he was also more open than the others to the world of hard physical work, and more emphatic in his willingness to take it as his subject.Caillebotte painted two versions of the Floor Scrapers, exhibiting both at the second Impressionist show in 1876. It was work he had seen at his parents' home. This was an aspect of Courbet's and Millet's realism adapted to the Impressionist idiom.

37916-oudevrij.jpg	In this painting a comical figure is greeting a young woman in an interior. The comical elderly figure making the theatrical bow to the young woman who turns to observe him is dressed as the Commedia dell'Arte figure of Pantaleone. Above the elderly jester hangs an empty birdcage. Steen painted a similar birdcage in many other paintings, for example the Beanfeast, dated 1668 (Staatliche Museen, Kassel). The Kassel painting also shows the same sort of Commedia dell'Arte figure who, beside wearing the same Pantaleone costume, plays a rommelpot, to emphasize his role as a fool who is after the attention of the comely girl.As in so many of his works, Jan Steen has here included a caricature of his own features in the face of the amused peasant who turns to observe the comic encounter behind him

00717-landsca2.jpg	Two extensive landscapes constitute the only known examples of a collaboration between Gian Paolo Panini, the most celebrated view-painter in 18th-century Rome, and Paolo Anesi, arguably the most accomplished landscapist of his time. Both paintings were almost certainly designed by Panini, as the numerous related preparatory drawings suggest, but the landscapes in both works were executed by Anesi. Anesi seems to have been responsible for the landscapes and distant figures in each painting, whilst Panini executed the main protagonists and buildings in the foreground. The present extensive landscape depicts carriages and elegant figures on a road, including Pannini himself, gardens and fields on either side. The pendant extensive landscape depicts villas and figures, including Panniini himself, dining beneath a pergola in the foreground.

39771-15girlfa.jpg	In the 1560s Titian began to record himself and his family. His daughter Lavinia, who was born after 1530, has been associated with the Girl with a Fan as well as with the Young Woman with a Dish of Fruit, and both portraits are characterized by a pride and affection that suggests a strong personal bond with the artist. The Prado Self-Portrait of c. 1560 shows Titian as withdrawn and distant in near profile, in contrast to an earlier Self-Portrait in Berlin, where he appears without the tools of his trade but as if staring critically at an unseen canvas as described by Palma Giovane.This painting is in exceptionally good condition, allowing one to admire the stiff silk of the dress conjured up by a dense weave of brushstrokes

39258-1prese.jpg	"This painting, consisting of two vertical halves now stitched together in the middle, once adorned the outsides of two organ wings. The monumental stairway indicates the musical connection; its 15 steps or ""grades"" refer to the 15 graduals, the psalms sung by pilgrims in annual temple processions. The singers' gallery above the organ was also painted by Tintoretto. The dark carving of the breastwork and the frames of the wings were partly gilded, like the stairway in the painting; Tintoretto picked out its undulating ornamentation in gold leaf. This ""Byzantine"" stylistic element is particularly effective in the shadowy area on the left, where it produces a sense of mystic illumination.

11661-farnese.jpg	"The Maiden and the Unicorn is part of the decor commissioned for the Galleria Farnese under the artistic directorship of Annibale Carracci. The fresco above the south-east wall was identified at an early stage as the work of his student Domenichino, yet scholars still disagree as to the extent to which it was executed alone.Whatever aspects of this painting may be comparable with Annibale's own compositions, this work betrays a very different temperament indeed. The strict avoidance of dynamic spatial diagonals and the grouping of unicorn and maiden parallel to the picture plane correspond much more closely to Domenichino's ""classicistic"" orientation and his preference for the art of the Renaissance, including the paintings of Raphael. Psychologically, too, much speaks for this painting's entire execution by Domenichino. The unicorn is not merely an attribute of the virgin. In the tradition of this allegory of chastity, the unicorn seeks refuge in the lap of a virgin. Domenichino emphasizes the shyness of these two sensitive creatures who have moved out of the centre of the picture towards the edge of the woods. Instead of the full-blooded sensuality of Annibale's figures in the Galleria Farnese, Domenichino conveys an expression of quiet and gentle introversion"

14463-309fried.jpg	"This painting may be understood as a sort of programmatic statement and resume of Friedrich's aims and intentions. A source of inspiration for the painting was the polar expedition mounted by William Edward Parry from 1819 to 1820 in search of the North-west Passage. The painting's icy palette corresponds to the Arctic setting. It is undoubtedly one of the artist's masterpieces, yet the radical nature of its composition and subject was greeted in its own day with incomprehension and rejection. The picture remained unsold right up to Friedrich's death in 1840.In the painting, now often called The Wreck of the Hope, the painter imbued the subject with unsurpassable dramatic intensity. The particular feature of this work is that the drama has already happened. The huge towering pinnacles are the slowly moving icebergs that have long become fixed here. The bold attempt by man to burst the bounds of his allotted sphere ends in death.When the artist was 13, an accident occurred, that, perhaps subconsciously, formed part of the shadow that seemed to darken his temperament throughout his life. While ice skating he was saved from drowning by his younger brother Christoph, but Christoph himself drowned in the icy water before his eyes. It can be hardly denied that Friedrich's various ""sea of ice"" paintings must be seen in relation to this traumatic experience"

10171-1salome5.jpg	The biblical source for the painting is Matthew 14:6-11 or Mark 6:21-28, where the daughter of Herodias danced for her stepfather, Herod, on his birthday. As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger.Cranach's panel shows the scene following the beheading. It is a fine example of the painter's talent as a narrator. The depiction of Herod overcome by his passion and tricked as a result forms part of a group in Cranach's oeuvre portraying the 'duplicity of women.'Herodias's daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.

16502-7penteco.jpg	Scientific examination has established that this little panel is the seventh, and last of a series of scenes from the life of Christ originally painted on one plank and formed a long low altarpiece of exceptional width. Other panels are scattered in museums in the United States and Europe, and comprise, from left to right the Nativity, the Presentation in the Temple, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, the Entombment and Christ's Descent into Limbo. The panels are united not only through their stories, scale and style, and the pattern of wood grain made visible through X-radiograph, but also in their unusual gilding.Although the uneven quality of the figures suggests the collaboration of assistants, the two men in the foreground, solidly painted on the ground and psychologically alert despite the decorative symmetry of their poses, are almost certainly by Giotto himself.

44303-c_cross.jpg	The Cross stands in an undulating landscape. The scene is profoundly peaceful, giving no suggestion of the place of execution as recorded in the Bible; the two thieves and the soldiers are missing. Only the mourners stand under the Cross, the Virgin on the left, supported by two female companions, and Saint John on the right, wringing his hands in anguish ; yet, far from conveying a deep sense of emotion, they seem almost like travellers who have stopped to pray by a wayside cross. The donor of the picture is shown kneeling beside the stony path, his hands raised in prayer, his eyes turned heavenwards.Almost the entire width of the background is taken up by a lake; a town and a fortified castle stand on its rocky shore. They are depicted with such precision as to suggest a definite locality, but the topographical details have never been identified with any known place. However, Lake Geneva suggests itself as one possibility, since the painter spent the greater part of his life in the Swiss countryside.The motif of the Cross in an open landscape was one with which Witz would have become acquainted through the Netherlandish painters. The nature of the composition, the attitude of the kneeling donor, the mourners in their loose, flowing robes, the landscape and, not least, the fleecy clouds in the sky recall Van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden. On the other hand, there is nothing in the artist's little-documented life-history to indicate how he came to be influenced by them.Witz was born at Rottweil in Swabia, probably in the first decade of the fifteenth century. From 1434 onwards he lived in Basel, where he painted the so-called Altar of the Redemption, the several panels of which have found their way into different collections. In Geneva he completed the altar for St Peter's Cathedral in 1444, but thereafter he disappears into obscurity, and in 1447 his wife was registered as a widow. Both the altarpieces show a highly individual and unmistakable style but give no real hint as to Konrad Witz's artistic antecedents. The Berlin Crucifixion is of special interest, in that it was clearly painted in the earlier period of the artist's life, before he settled in Basel. In it one can see the first manifestation of the new realism, which, in the second quarter of the century, begins to replace the courtly, elegant, so-called `soft' style

13035-crowning.jpg	The contrast between the serenity of Christ and the villainy of his captors is vigorously conveyed in this early work by Van Dyck. The composition, as so often, is based on a prototype by Titian, of whom Van Dyck was a passionate admirer. But the influence of Rubens is also crucial, and the presentation is typically baroque: the viewer is forced into the role of a close but helpless witness of the violence enacted. The effect is reinforced by Van Dyck's textures - for instance the exposed and brilliant chest of Christ against the gleaming precision of the axe above or the fluid musculature of the tormentor beside it

32768-05portra.jpg	Perugino was to have a great influence on Raphael and so were northern masters. In fact in the 19th century Raphael's Portrait of a Man which can be dated to the period of his youth (c. 1502), was thought to be by Holbein and then by Perugino, until Giovanni Morelli met with general consensus by attributing it to Raphael. This portrait, probably of a duke given the shape of the hat, is idealized in the perfect modelling of the volumes, flowing hair and vivid expression. The approach is very different from the realistic style of the northern painters, who sought to include all the true-to-life details including defects

Her downfall came when Henry learned of her premarital affairs. However, since no authentic portrait of Catherine is known, this identification has not held up.Because the painting belonged to the Cromwells for centuries, it is more likely that she was a member of that prominent family.

39662-01jerome.jpg	The rounded part of the panel is a later addition (perhaps by the artist), as shown by copies such as in the Accademia di San Luca, Rome. Ridolfi mentions the painting as being in the church of S. Maria Nuova, Venice, from which it was taken in 1808 to the Brera.A clearing in the woods is immersed in the reflections of a fiery sunset, and the stones and the skin of the old ascetic share the same old-gold fluorescence. This chromatic blaze is the real subject of the painting. In composition, the Mannerist framework of crossed diagonals is not an end in itself but accentuates the vitality of wild nature, and suggests that the wind is blowing. Having broken the old relationship between tonal painting and the twilight effects of Giorgione, Titian devoted himself to the monumental style without, however, any rhetorical preconceptions. Following the single principle of rendering the strongest visual emotion, he achieved the highest lyrical freedom. The success and popularity of this painting is shown by the existence of numerous replicas, copies and derivations, including one by Rubens in Haarlem and another by Brusasorzi in Rovereto

42005-solomoa.jpg	Solomon was the son of David and Bathsheba, and third king of united Israel; his wisdom was proverbial. Solomon's rein saw the construction of the Temple at Jerusalem.According to the biblical story Solomon was called upon to judge between the claims of two prostitutes who dwelt in one house, each of whom had given birth to a child at the same time. One infant had died and each woman then claimed that the other belonged to her. To determine the truth the king ordered a sword to be brought, saying, 'Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.' At this, the true mother revealed herself by renouncing her claim to the child in order that its life might be spared. The child was restored to her.The scene, widely depicted in Christian art, shows Solomon on his throne, the two suppliant women before him. An executioner stands holding the living child aloft in one hand, with a sword in the other. The dead child lies on the ground. The subject was made to prefigure the Last Judgment, and came to be used as a symbol of Justice in a wider sense.Though earlier this painting was thought to be a copy, the canvas is now considered to be an autograph work of Valentin. A prominent member of Rome's colony of transalpine painters, this Frenchman was active in the papal city from around 1613 until his death in 1632.A replica of this picture, with slight variations and dated to 1625-26, is conserved at the Louvre. In both versions, Valentin arranges his scene along a central axis that coincides with the figure of Solomon: to either side are counterbalanced groups, each centring on one of the two female protagonists of this biblical narrative. The figures are emphasized as much as possible by the strong and direct light.Between the original and the second version, variants in the arms of the woman to the right (gathered to her breast in the Parisian picture) have the effect of giving greater movement to the scene and better emphasizing the figure of the true mother. Differences in the idealization of the figures, the more refined and subtle definition of the light and chromatic range in the Louvre picture, and the more intense rendering of the chiaroscuro in the Roman painting lead to the conclusion that the Roman work is earlier than the French one and must have been executed around 1620. This conclusion is supported by the many similarities between the National Gallery picture and other confirmed works by Valentin that date to the same years.

15462-2sistin.jpg	"The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel, it is located in the third compartment on the north wall.Vasari wrote: ""...Domenico represented Christ calling Peter and Andrew from their nets, and the Resurrection of Christ, the greater part of which is now destroyed, for it was above the door..."" Later, the Resurrection vanished completely in the destruction of the wall.In the early 1480s Pope Sixtus IV brought a number of famous Tuscan and Umbrian artists to Rome in order to decorate his new court chapel, the Sistine Chapel. Ghirlandaio must already have made a name for himself with his commissions, primarily the frescoes for the Saint Fina Chapel, in order to be considered for a task of this importance. The chapel's ceiling would not be decorated with Michelangelo's famous frescoes until the reign of Sixtus' nephew, Julius II. Between 1481 and 1483, the walls of the chapel were covered with frescoes by Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Cosimo Rosselli, Piero di Cosimo and others - probably under the direction of Pietro Perugino.On the left are scenes from the life of Moses, and on the right scenes from the life of Christ, a typological arrangement that sees Moses as the predecessor of Christ. This cycle of frescoes became one of the major artistic achievements of the Italian Quattrocento. In accordance with the Pope's wishes, in each picture several episodes of a story were presented together, a practice that by this time was already becoming outdated. The two frescoes Ghirlandaio painted were the Calling of Saint Peter and Resurrection. By Vasari's time the second fresco had been largely destroyed and an entirely new version was painted in the 16th century.The surviving work is divided into two zones. In the foreground, on a shallow stage, Ghirlandaio depicted several groups of people, tightly packed together in rows. At the centre Christ is blessing the kneeling brothers Simon, Peter and Andrew, His first disciples. They follow Him and appear again in the background on the right. There they witness Christ calling James and John, who are sitting in a boat mending their nets with their father, Zebedee.The massiveness of the heavy garments worn by the figures in the main scene in the centre foreground is reminiscent of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel dating from about 1424 -1428. It is mainly Masaccio's Tribute Money that matches this one in terms of colour, landscape, figure types.It is at the sides of the picture field that Ghirlandaio dares to display his own developing style. The group of women on the left, including a woman in blue seen from behind, anticipates the female figures he paints in later works. In this fresco he also gives a free rein to the highly individual style of portraiture he had developed in the Vespucci and Saint Fina chapels. On the right, arranged in an exactly level row like pearls on a string, are members of the most influential Florentine families who maintained residences in Rome. In the centre stands Giovanni Tornabuoni, representing the Medici family's merchant bank. He later became a sponsor of Ghirlandaio and was made the Pope's treasurer despite the enduring enmity between Pope Sixtus IV and the Medici.His son Lorenzo Tornabuoni - in front of him, wearing a black garment - lived to see his wife die young and his family go bankrupt after his father's death. In 1477, Ghirlandaio painted two episodes from the life of Saint John the Baptist and two from the life of the Madonna for the mortuary chapel of Lorenzo's mother, Francesca Pitti Tornabuoni, in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. According to Vasari, these works were very famous at the time; unfortunately they no longer exist, though two charming portraits of Lorenzo's wife, Giovanna Tornabuoni, who died young, have survived.To the right of Giovanni Tornabuoni stands the humanist John Argyropoulos, wearing a white beard. He wrote commentaries on Aristotle and fled to Florence from Constantinople when the city fell to the Turks in 1453. A friend of Cosimo de' Medici, he spent fifteen years as a court scholar and professor of Greek at the University of Florence, until he was summoned to Rome by the Pope. He nonetheless continued to see himself as a Florentine, as Lorenzo de' Medici had accorded him civil rights there.The nobleman beside him, with white hair and no hat, is thought to be either Francesco Soderini from Florence, or Raimondo Orsini from Rome. The young man behind him, with the brightly shining face, is thought to be Antonio Vespucci. Separate from the other Florentines, behind Christ, stands Diotisalvi Neroni, an earlier friend of Cosimo de' Medici. He lived in a more or less willing exile in Rome, as he was involved in plots against Cosimo's son Piero.It was not only his skill in portraits but also his skill in landscapes, visible in the fresco in the Sistine Chapel, that made Ghirlandaio famous. The entire upper half of this work is devoted to an extensive landscape with a high horizon. The Sea of Galilee, hemmed in by hills and mountains, is snaking its way like a river into the background, where, in accordance with aerial perspective, the colours are paler and lighter. In the sky brightly coloured birds are swooping - birds derived from Benozzo Gozzoli's Procession of the Magi, painted between 1459 and 1461 for the Florence Medici palace, and also from works by Domenico Veneziano"

30639-chickven.jpg	This painting and a small group of other paintings were attributed in the 1940s to an anonymous artist called 'Pensionante del Saraceni', literally the boarder of Saraceni. He was believed to be French. The theme of the chicken vendor was popular with sixteenth-century northern painters, as well as with Lombard and Bolognese artists. Pensionante has studied the subtle atmosphere of Caravaggio's Gypsy Fortune Teller and created an intense relationship between the two figures. The soft, velvety quality of the light and modeling differs sharply from the chiaroscuro of other Caravaggesque painters.The theme of the painting, like that of Caravaggio's painting, is trickery. The young man holds out two coins for the two chickens to the vendor, whose crafty expression suggests a foolish pleasure in the transaction, behind his back his customer filches a third

The composition, known in two other autograph versions (one of similar size in Edinburgh from around 1590, and another smaller and later in the Prado from around 1600), has usually been interpreted as an allegory with some sort of moralising intent; it is unlikely that it was conceived simply as a genre scene.

25081-doctor.jpg	The attribution of the fresco is debated. Originally Vasari attributed it to Cimabue, however, this attribution was rejected at the end of the 18th century. Since then some critics attributed it to Pietro Cavallini or one of his followers; Jacopo Torriti or a follower, the young Giotto or a follower.  In the four compartments of the vault in the entrance bay the artist portrays the four Doctors of Church together with their scribes: in the south (at the left of the illustration) St Augustine and opposite him, St Ambrose; in the east (at the bottom) St Jerome, and in the west St Gregory. The architectural structures jut up from below into the gold background. The painter conveys a definite idea of the intellectual work of these saints through the great attention to detail and the perspectival accuracy.The picture shows the vault before the 1997 earthquake

35524-55mythol.jpg	"The Three Graces is one of the artist's final works. He had portrayed this theme several times since about 1620, but only later adopted the form that prevailed in classical Antiquity, with the three figures forming a circle so that one of them has her back to the spectator. ""They were the goddesses of pleasant charm, of charitable deeds and of gratitude . .. without them nothing would be graceful or pleasing. They gave people friendliness, uprightness of character, sweetness and conversation...They were presented as three beautiful virgins and were either completely naked or clothed in some fine, transparent fabric...They stood together all three so that two of their faces were turned towards the spectator and only one was turned away from him.""Rubens' late painting of three nude figures magnificently illustrates the artist's extraordinary handling of incarnate or human flesh tones. Rubens builds them up using the three primary colours yellow, red and blue. An unusually high proportion of blue is evident here. In this way, the human figure bears the same primary colours that make up the appearance of the world and the entire cosmos, and all that is gathered here in the landscape and flowers, the sky and the trees"

18418-2006grec.jpg	St Ildefonso (c. 606-667) was a Spanish prelate, born in Toledo, abbot of its Benedictine monastery at nearby Agli, appointed archbishop of Toledo in 657. Among his numerous theological writings was a defence of the 'perpetual virginity' of the Virgin Mary. His vision of the Virgin is represented in Spanish painting. It is related that he saw the Virgin with attendant angles seated on his episcopal throne in the cathedral. As he approached she threw over him a chasuble of heavenly origin.El Greco represent the patron saint of Toledo in full episcopal regalia, holding an elaborate gilt crosier through its green velvet sleeve wearing white kid gloves. He is wearing a spectacular chasuble  embroidered with floral arabesques and exotic birds, lined with pink silk, over a radiant white alb, and on his head an embroidered mitre. He reads a holy book with serious intensity while all around him the sky seems charged with high-voltage static.The saint is illuminated from the left, in contrast to the companion piece of St Peter, who is lit from the light. This, and the arched top of both canvases (reduced in both paintings) indicate that they were conceived to flank a window or central image. This was almost certainly The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception. Thus St Peter would have been intended to hang to the left of the altarpiece and St Ildefonso to the right. It is unlikely that these paintings were ever hung in the chapel, having been substituted with copies from the start

19145-37nohad.jpg	Hals new tendency towards restraint is seen in the two large group portraits of civil guards made during the 1630s: the Officers and Sergeants of the St Hadrian Civic Guard of Haarlem (c. 1633) and the Officers and Sergeants of the St George Civic Guard Company (c. 1639), both in the Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem. The vivacity of the setting is already slightly subdued in the group portrait painted 1633 by the subordination of the figures to a horizontal band, and this horizontal accent completely dominates the arrangement of the figures in the group portrait painted 1639. In both group portraits the figures are set  in the open air, but they lose rather than gain in plein-air quality. This is particularly true of the picture of 1639, which is dominated by a warm golden olive tone, while the one of 1633 still retains a good deal of the colouristic vivacity and charm of the 1620s, and also some of the compositional boldness and agitation of the earlier period.The picture of 1639, in which Hals's self-portrait is to be seen, is the master's last representation of a civic guard group.

03930-madchild.jpg	Jacopo Bellini, who had perhaps worked as an assistant to Gentile da Fabriano in Florence in 1423, interpreted the laws of linear perspective and plastic form adopted by the Tuscan artists working in Padua in a spirit which was in effect still Gothic. He had frequent contact with the Tuscan artists working in Padua, where in fact in 1453 his daughter Nicolosia married Andrea Mantegna. He shows a predilection in his paintings for the musical linear rythms and the bright range of colors typical of the International Gothic style and at times for a grave Byzantine solemnity though this latter is compositionally more spacious in his version. A typical example of this tendency towards archaism is the Madonna and Child Blessing where an impenetrable ground of small cherubs' heads etched in gold forms the base for the image.The painting is signed on the original frame: OPUS.JACOBI.BELLINI.VENETI

30030-08paal.jpg	"The art of L�szl� Pa�l gave many original features to Barbizon School. Of the great masters in Pa�l's time only Millet actually lived in Barbizon, and he followed the activity of the Hungarian artist and the other young painters who worked there with great interest, and was highly appreciative of his passionate paintings. Pa�l's work was first associated with that of Th�odore. Rousseau and later he was compared with Diaz de la P�na. Yet there is something that makes him quite different from them - his imposing power of rendering, and his highly nostalgic, nature-inspired delineation. In his best works, the romantic approach is combined with a realistic representation and expression of atmospheric effects.The painting ""In the Forest of Fontainebleau"" is bathed in sunlight, the forms are strict and there is still a vibrant translucent effect. His palette has an abundance of greens - glistening olives, the pale green of sunlit leaves, the sea-green of moss, the dark green of the deep mysterious forest - these and many more variations of green foliage shimmer in the dancing shafts of sunlight.Not one of his works was acquired by a museum during his lifetime, and his only official recognition, the ""mention honorable"" of the Paris Salon came when he was already seriously ill. In 1880 two of his pictures were bought for the collection of the National Museum. Thanks to Elek Petrovics, the Museum of Fine Arts, despite financial difficulties, bought a number of his works during and after the First World War, among them his painting"

05293-1triptyc.jpg	This painting was possibly one of the works formerly belonging to the Escorial, bought by Damiano de Goes, the Portuguese painter, between 1523-1545.Bosch's spiritual heroes were the saints who endured both physical and mental torment, yet remained steadfast. Among the saints, Bosch's favourite was Saint Anthony, the subject of his triptych The Temptation of Saint Anthony.St Anthony (Anthony the Great, or Anthony the Abbot, 251-356) was a Christian saint and hermit, born in Upper Egypt. On the death of his parents he distributed his property among the poor and retired into the Egyptian desert where he remained in solitude for many years. He is generally regarded as the founder of monasticism. During an epidemic, said to be erysipelas, in Europe in the 11th century many cures were claimed in his name and the disease became known as St Anthony's fire. Anthony, like some other hermits, was subject to vivid hallucinations resulting from his ascetic life in the desert. These 'temptations' assume two forms in art, assault by demons and erotic visions.The triptych features physical punishment on the left wing, a Black Mass in the centre, and the blandishments of food and sex on the right wing. St Anthony's triumph over such trials is mirrored by those of other hermit saints and by the Passion of Christ, whose arrest and carrying of the cross adorn the exterior of the Lisbon altarpiece.

21177-village.jpg	"Koninck is one of the last generation of Dutch landscape painters. In the 1660s, there was a general tendency to ""upgrade"" the various genres. During this period, the interiors of Vermeer and de Hooch became increasingly elegant, and even the still-lifes were freighted with ""noblesse"". In the work of Koninck, this trend even affected the landscapes, in which he positioned courtly figures and palatial architecture.In the 1650s, by contrast, when Koninck was at the height of his creative powers, he produced landscapes of exceptional purity, bringing the flat panoramic landscape to its greatest perfection. A soft and golden light is cast across the flat countryside, illuminating things that are, in themselves, uninteresting: sandy dunes, the occasional tree, some water, a village. There is nothing remarkable or jarring. The sensation is where the brown earth is bathed in sunlight to a golden hue.Koninck was influenced by Rembrandt's landscape painting, which represents a chapter in its own right within his enormous oeuvre. Rembrandt's influence is evident in the golden-brown tone of his paintings and in the way Koninck occasionally integrates unexpected and fantastic objects such as a glittering bridge spanning the water, a ruin or a fairy-tale castle"

26365-armyloui.jpg	On the death of Philip IV of Spain, Louis XIV claimed the Low Countries and the Franche-Comt� in the name of his wife Marie-Th�r�se. This policy of conquest led the king to the gates of Tournai in 1667 during the so-called War of Devolution. The city, badly protected by the old 13th century town wall, could offer little resistance. It was besieged on 21 June 1667, capitulated on the 23rd, and the king made a triumphal entry on the 25th. The treaty of Aachen, on 2 May 1668, marked its attachment to France.Here the artist has depicted, not the siege of the city, but the setting up of the camp with, in the middle ground, the deployment of the troops and, in the background, the city, recognisable by its superb cathedral. Camp life is described by a multitude of picturesque details, admirably painted and treated with vigour. The group of unsaddled horses to the left, a type of depiction in which Van der Meulen excelled, is particularly successful. A few touches of red, blue and yellow enliven the ensemble. Groups of trees carry the eye to the brightly-lit plain where the musketeers are parading in blue uniforms and the light cavalry of the guard in red. In the background Tournai, seen from the north-east, spreads out its monuments behind its medieval walls. To the left of the cathedral we make out the imposing St Martin's Abbey with its narrow spire and the massive tower of St Brice. On the other side of the five belfries and above the Romanesque nave, we glimpse the tower of the now demolished St Nicaise's Church. Preparatory drawings were done by the artist in situ during his journey in 1667, following the French troops.After joining Charles Le Brun at the Manufacture des Gobelins in 1664, Van der Meulen was commissioned with drawing the views of the cities conquered by the king. The Brussels painting belongs to the first series of the King's Conquests, painted for the Royal Pavilion in Marly and placed in 1684, covering the various campaigns in Flanders, Franche-Comt� and Holland. Designed as decoration, this series is remarkable for its variety and for its painting quality. Whilst the Brussels artist took French nationality in 1673, he never, in his art, denied his Flemish origins. Here he imparts a new dimension to the painting of battle scenes, achieving the right balance between military scenes, topographical descriptions and landscapes.

06806-the_nun.jpg	"Giuliano Bugiardini, following the teachings of the three great masters of his time, Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo (of whom he was a friend and assistant), developed a style not lacking in individual character, which is manifested here in the sharpness of the line and the use of plain, metallic colour tones.Ferdinando III of Lorrain, Grand Duke of Tuscany, bought the picture in 1819 as a masterwork by Leonardo da Vinci, but the attribution has been soon after changed and it is still not certain: among the artists suggested there are Mariotto Albertinelli and Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, besides Giuliano Bugiardini who is actually the author accepted. To the convent of Sant'Jacopo a Ripoli, represented on the right in the landscape, is due the surname of Nun given to the woman in the nineteenth century when  the portrait of this unknown beauty was referred to as ""Leonardo's nun"".

A highly refined patron of the arts, Flavio Chigi had a predilection for bizarre and picturesque themes. His collection reflected a curiosity towards lay culture that was foreign to the representational collecting of the seventeenth-century ""cardinal nephews"" up to this point. The Italian state acquired this painting from the Chigi collection in 1918.The painting depicts the Holy Family's flight into Egypt according to a text from the Apocrypha. Details like the presence of Salome (the midwife of Christ) and the miracle of the palms help locate the precise narrative moment and source. The Rest on the Flight into Egypt is datable to between 1630 and circa 1645, on the basis of the neo-Venetian and Poussinian influences that are evident in the picture. Examples of these include the setting of the scene in a luxuriant landscape and the insertion of a classical sarcophagus at the centre.One of the fixed points around which Caroselli's career may be reconstructed, this picture dates to before 1645, the year when the painter began to show more of the influence of Filippo Lauri, the landscapist who became his brother-in-law in 1642"

05649-birth.jpg	The Birth of Venus is the quintessence of Boucher's aims, blending the natural and the artificial to make a completely enchanted scene, exuberant and yet relaxed, an aquatic frolic and yet also an air-borne, sea-borne, vision which has authentic pagan feeling. It is a glimpse to make anyone less forlorn as these creatures rise dripping from the waves. The green water itself becomes an exciting erotic element as it swells and falls, bearing up the pearl-pale bodies that abandon themselves to it and offer their limbs like branches of white coral as perches for Venus's doves. In place of Tiepolo's romantic nobility there is a human simplicity. Despite the snorting dolphins and having Tritons, the tumbling putti and the tremendous twist of silver and salmon-pink striped awning, the goddess remains a ravishingly pretty., demure girl, half-shy of the commotion of which she is the centre. She, like the nymphs around her, is reality idealized, divinely blonde and slender, touched with a voluptuous vacancy, a lack of animation, which perhaps only increase her charm. The insolent consciousness of Tiepolo's people is replaced here by innocence bordering on stupidity; herself so desirable, the goddess seems without desires. Boucher keeps much closer than Tiepolo to the terms of ordinary experience; his idealizing touches are restricted to the refining of ankles and wrists, perfecting of the arc of the eyebrows, tinting a deeper red the lips and nipples. Both artists can be related to the sculpture of their period. Boucher belongs with the naturalistic nude statuettes of Falconet and Clodion; Tiepolo has much more in common with the extremes of gilded and rouged Bavarian rococo sculpture

43309-pomposa.jpg	Pomposa Abbey, dedicated to St Mary, is a Benedictine monastery in Codigoro near Ferrara, Italy. It was one of the most important in northern Italy, famous for the Carolingian manuscripts preserved in its rich library, one of the wealthiest of Carolingian repositories, and for the Romanesque buildings. The church is an example of a triple-nave Ravennan basilica with arcaded aisles and carpentry rafters, originating in the 7th-9th centuries.The church received an extensive fresco decoration in 1351 by Vitale da Bologna and his workshop. It included an apse with Christ enthroned in a mandorla among angels and saints, the evangelists, and the church fathers, as well as scenes from the life of St Eustace; nave walls with scenes from the Old and New Testaments, including numerous motifs from the Apocalypse; and on the entrance wall a Last Judgment. Besides a similarly comprehensive pictorial program encountered later (c. 1378) in the baptistery of Padua by Giusto de' Menabuoi, there are no other parallels in this period.

27052-h_altar.jpg	Around 1560-70 Catholics in the Holy Roman Empire, shocked by the continuing threats of iconoclasm and, perhaps, chastened by Protestant criticism of religious art, commissioned relatively few new, non-memorial paintings and sculptures for their churches. Most new works were intended for private devotional use. The revival of large-scale Catholic religious art occurred only rarely before the 1580s. One exception was the monumental high altar commissioned by Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria (r. 1550-79) for the Liebfrauenm�nster in Ingolstadt. Ordered in 1560 to commemorate the centennial of the University of Ingolstadt (1572), whose students worshipped in this church, it was the first true Counter-Reformation altarpiece in Germany. Hans Mielich, Albrecht's court artist, spent about six years designing the ninety-one different paintings that he and his assistants made for the front and back of this polyptych. It displays a summa of Catholic faith with its insistent emphasis on the Virgin Mary, the church patroness, and, on the reverse, St Catherine of Alexandria, patron of students. In the central panel, the Virgin and Child with angels hover in the air just above the duke and his family. The sculpted Coronation of the Virgin by Hans W�rner (fl. 1576-81) concludes the narrative

10666-coronat1.jpg	This panel, formerly attributed to both Jacopo di Cione and his brother, Andrea Orcagna, was probably part of a larger altarpiece. It has undergone two interventions. The base with Four Musical Angels was cut from the bottom of the Coronation of the Virgin at some date before 1828 - the year in which the panel entered the Christ Church Collection in Oxford. A second intervention occurred sometime after the cutting when the top and bottom additions were made to the panel. The current frame is not original.The Coronation of the Virgin is almost identical to the central panel of an altarpiece from Santa Maria Novella, Florence, now in the Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence.

06182-02left4.jpg	The picture shows a detail of the left wing of the Dijon Altarpiece.The Visitation is not a literal rendering of the Bible story. Broederlam gives us the essence of St Luke's text: Mary, already pregnant with the Infant Jesus, meets her cousin Elizabeth who, although supposedly barren, is now by the grace of God expecting a child in her old age. In the painting, the two women are depicted side by side. Mary wears a large blue cloak which she gathers round herself with one hand, while with her free hand she gestures towards Elizabeth. The older woman is dressed in red and green, her head veiled in a fine white material. Although the painter has followed the Scriptures by setting the scene in a mountainous landscape, according to the Gospel the two women meet inside Zacharias's house and not as here, outdoors, in the shadow of a steep rocky cliff

34418-holmes.jpg	The painting is signed (apparently strengthened): I.R. PI.t. and inscribed lower left: BRIDGET. HOLMES./ETAs SUAE:96. A:D:1686:The name of the sitter and her advanced age (96) are apparent from the inscription. Bridget Holmes was in fact a 'Necessary Woman' who lived to the age of one hundred. Her period of royal service began during the time of Charles I and continued into the reign of William III and Mary II. She is shown playing a game with a Page of the Backstairs.Riley was appointed Principal Painter to William III and Mary II jointly with Sir Godfrey Kneller in 1688. As a native-born artist he holds an important place in the development of English portrait painting and there is a line of descent that extends from him through Jonathan Richardson the Elder to Thomas Hudson, who was the first master of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Yet his official portraits were not always very convincing; a pupil, Thomas Murray, recorded Charles II's remarks on seeing his portrait: 'Is this like me? (oddsfish) then I'm an ugly fellow.' By contrast, Riley seems to have had more success with less formal commissions. As Waterhouse observed, 'It is obvious that Riley was most at home below stairs.' Indeed, two such portraits are known: A Scullion and Katherine Elliot (Royal Collection), the latter painted in conjunction with Johann-Baptist Closterman.The present portrait is conceived on a monumental scale with all the props (notably the curtain and the vase with a relief of dancing nymphs) of fashionable portraiture, a view that runs counter to the social status of the sitter. It is possible that some satirical or moral comment was intended by this juxtaposition. The vase has been identified by Timothy Clifford as one occurring in a print of 1582 by Cherubino Alberti, after a fresco by Polidoro da Caravaggio on the fa�ade of the Palazzo Milesi in Rome (Via della Maschera d'Oro). Reynolds also used the vase in the background of a number of portraits. The subject of this portrait by Riley is comparable with certain contemporary Dutch paintings (for example, An Interior with a Sleeping Maid and her Mistress by Nicolaes Maes - London, National Gallery). The colouring of the portrait is characteristically rich, but the drawing is unusually accurate for this artist

33471-06mythol.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 472.Among the early works by Rembrandt, two mythological scenes, the Abduction of Europa, and the Diana Bathing, take place on richly wooded riverbanks. Both are scenes of divine intervention on earth. In the first the god Zeus abducts Princess Europa, and in the other the goddess Diana turns the unfortunate hunter Actaeon into a stag who is then devoured by his own dogs. The settings for the compositions are quite similar: a shoreline curves from  the right foreground into the left middle ground; above it is an opening into a background that is blocked  at the back. The largest elements in the compositions are massive, looming trees. This compositional scheme derives fromformulas that had been wworked out by Flemish artists in the preceding decades.

40839-boleyn.jpg	"Whether the undated panel, the inscription of which describes Anne as Henry VIII's wife, was done in her lifetime is difficult to determine, as the picture could have been painted after her death for a member of her family. It was said of Anne that she ""was not one of the most beautiful women in the world""; ""she was of middling height, had a dark complexion, a long neck, a wide mouth... and fine black eyes.""Anna Boleyn (1507-1536) was the second wife of King Henry VIII of England and mother of Queen Elizabeth I. The events surrounding the annulment of Henry's marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and his marriage to Anne led him to break with the Roman Catholic church and brought about the English Reformation.Anne's father was Sir Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Ormonde. After spending part of her childhood in France, she returned to England in 1522 and lived at Henry's court and drew many admirers. A desired marriage with Lord Henry Percy was prevented on Henry's order by Cardinal Wolsey, and at some undetermined point the king himself fell in love with her.In 1527 Henry initiated secret proceedings to obtain an annulment from his wife, the aging Catherine of Aragon; his ultimate aim was to father a legitimate male heir to the throne. For six years Pope Clement VII, under pressure from Henry's rival Charles V, refused to grant the annulment, but all the while Henry's passion for Anne was strengthening his determination to rid himself of his queen. About January 25, 1533, Henry and Anne were secretly married. The union was made public on Easter of that year, and on May 23 Henry had the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, pronounce the marriage to Catherine null and void. In September Anne gave birth to a daughter, the future queen Elizabeth I.Anne's arrogant behaviour soon made her unpopular at court. Although Henry lost interest in her and began liaisons with other women, the birth of a son might have saved the marriage. Anne had a miscarriage in 1534, and in January 1536 she gave birth to a stillborn male child. On May 2, 1536, Henry had her committed to the Tower of London on a charge of adultery with various men and even incest with her own brother. She was tried by a court of peers, unanimously convicted, and beheaded on May 19. On May 30 Henry married Jane Seymour. That Anne was guilty as charged is unlikely; she was the apparent victim of a temporary court faction supported by Thomas Cromwell. "

42754-2castel2.jpg	The unusual feature of the iconography is that it is not Joseph of Arimathaea that holds the body of Christ as would be customary, but Nicodemus, identifiable because he is younger, has a dark beard and wears turban-style headgear. His hands are covered to avoid direct physical contact. Joseph of Arimathaea on the other hand appears in the background as an old man with a white beard and hair in a well-chosen three-quarters profile. His features are undoubtedly presented as a portrait so that one could imagine him as a prominent member of the monastic community, perhaps even the patron who commissioned the devotional picture. In view of the sketch-like, summary execution of some parts of this very well-preserved picture, it has been assumed that it was a preparatory oil sketch for a larger-format painting that was never carried out. An argument against this is the masterly, delicate palette of reds, yellows, greens and blues providing delightful contrasts with violet and pink.The composition is based on an etching by Parmigianino. Characteristic of Veronese's free treatment of motifs and stylistic mannerisms is the way he adapts the gesture of Parmigianino's Joseph of Arimathaea and the emotional intensity of individual figures

06207-eleonora.jpg	Daughter of viceroy of Naples Don Pedro di Toledo, Eleonora married Cosimo I de' Medici in 1539 and died in 1562. In this picture, datable around 1545, she is portrayed with one of their eight sons, the young John, born in 1543 and died, as his mother of malaria, in 1562. The intense blue of the background and the stateliness of the figure enhance the preciousness of Eleonora's dress (for long time, erroneously believed her sepulture cloth), while her aristocratic beauty betrays a sense of melancholy.It was painted towards 1545, at the happiest moment of Bronzino's activity as a portrait painter. The diligent and frankly enjoyed description of the details of the costume are transfigured, through the geometrical simplification and the calm fixity of the light, into a vision of an almost ecstatic detachment.Archeological work in the tomb of Eleonora, the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici, has revealed fragments of the dress worn in this portrait

02869-joseph1.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of six Scenes from the Story of Joseph painted by Bachiacca for the wedding chamber of the Florentine Pier Francesco Borgherini, who married Maddalena Acciaiuoli in 1515. Four of the six panels are in the Galleria Borghese, while the other two (Joseph Makes Himself Known to His Brethren and The Second Visit of His Brethren to Egypt) are in the National Gallery in London. Other painters (Andrea del Sarto, Francesco Granacci and Pontormo) also contributed to this commission with works devoted to the same figure from the Old Testament. The pictures were used to decorate the furniture of the chamber.Stylistically, the influence of Northern European painting and engraving (in particular Altdorfer and Lucas van Leyden), is evident in the strong chiaroscuro of the figures, the styles of their dress and the landscape.The scenes from the story of Joseph, son of Jacob, were popular subjects in religious painting, partly because the patriarch was considered a prefiguration of Christ. Despite the presence of the same figures, recognizable by their features and the clothes they are wearing, the identification of the episodes from the Bible story, often combined in a single panel, is controversial

There is also a covered Huan-Li porcelain sugar bowl.Willem Kalf spent a few years in Paris as a young artist. There, he encountered new tendencies in still-life painting and absorbed them in his own work. Shortly after his return to Holland, he developed his own personal style of painting, rich still-lifes of luxury items - silver cups and dishes, Chinese porcelain vessels and elaborate Venetian-style wine glasses - mysteriously lit, displayed before a dark background, and often placed on an eastern tablecloth. Despite the high quality and luxury status of the objects he rendered, the compositions of those still-lifes are often restricted in their opulence. Kalf would concentrate on a few items per painting, which he would render to their best advantage - perfectly arranged and dramatically lit.

19083-03xnoshr.jpg	The British reference to Shrovetide, the period of three days preceding Lent, corresponds with seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Dutch description of the subject as Vastenavond (Eve of Lent, or Shrove Tuesday). Known elsewhere as Mardi Gras, the occasion is celebrated with a carnival devoted to foolish behaviour and popular foods such as pancakes and sausages.The bearded man in the centre of the painting holds a foxtail in his right hand, while with the left he paws the shoulder of a young blonde. The assumption that the girl is no lady but a young man in drag is supported by the hairstyle, which looks peculiar for a woman of the time. She - or he - appears to sit in her middle-aged admirer's lap. The central figure is flanked by two familiar characters of the comic stage: on the left Pekelharing (Pickled Herring), and, on the right, Hans Worst (John Sausage). These names were assigned to stock figures in satirical comedies.The painting is one the rare multifigured subject pictures of Hals. In the crowded life-size composition the figures are tightly knit. The heads above the principle Shrovetide revellers are summarily sketched, a former owner found these heads too coarse and had them painted out; they were revealed when the painting was cleaned at the Metropolitan Museum in 1951

It is one of the loveliest portraits executed by Bronzino for the Medici family. The girl, who wears a medallion with the profile of Cosimo around her neck, is portrayed with an expression of lucid fixity, in perfect accord with the enchanted happiness of childhood, and her very slight smile creates a magical air of suspense.

26679-10_1pe3.jpg	The scenes painted in the pendentives at the sides of prophet Jonah are characterized by the use of pronounced foreshortening. This is the case with the tangled group of Israelites who, in the scene of the Brazen Serpent, writhe in the throes of death, and, above all, with the crucified figure of Haman in the Punishment of Haman.In the irregular field of the pendentive on the left is the story opf Esther, Ahasueras, and Haman. On the right of the pendentive, the king sends Haman to provide royal apparel for Mordecai, who is sitting at the king's door. On the left Esther reveals Haman's plot to Ahasueras. The whole fresco is dramatically dominated, in the central scene, by the punishment of Haman. The daring foreshortening of the body, which literally cuts through the picture plane, is reinforced by by that of the white frame of the door leading into Ahasueras' room. The Old Testament book of Esther describes how a young Jewess interceded with a Persian king to prevent the massacre of her people. For this deed she is still commemorated in the Jewish festival of Purim, when the story is read aloud in the synagogue. It tells of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) of Persia who reigned in the 5th centurt B.C. Having dismissed his queen, Vashti, because she had offended him the king chose Esther to replace her, not knowing that she was Jewish. Esther, an orphan, was 'fair and beautiful' and had been brought up by her cousin, Mordecai. The king's chief minister, Haman, an enemy of the Jews and the personal foe of Mordecai, decreed that all the Jews in the Persian empire should be massacred. Mordecai asked Esther to intercede with the king. To enter the king's presence without being summoned was forbidden on pain of death, even to the queen, but Esther, having dressed in her finest robes, took her courage in both hands and entered the royal chamber. Ahasuerus held out his golden sceptre to signify that he would receive her and Esther swooned with relief. She led up to the matter by first inviting the king to a banquet where, in due course, her intercession on behalf of her people succeeded. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai.Esther in the act of pleading with the king was regarded by the Church as a prefiguration of the Virgin in her role of intercessor on the Day of Judgment. This became established early on as the central episode of the Esther narrative in Christian art. The more secular theme of the 'Toilet of Esther' gained popularity with artists of the Renaissance and later.Michelangelo's fresco depicts three episodes of the story in the centre with the crucifixion of Haman (instead of the Biblical hanging)

26591-07_3ce7.jpg	A divergent meaning has been read into this fresco by the earlier biographers, Condivi and Vasari. The spirit of God with the heavenly host moves above the waters; so they thought in terms of the creation of the great Sea Monster. But the main emphasis is on the moving ('ferabatur super aqua' in Saint Jerome) and the hallowing gesture; the title 'God Blesses the World' is indicated. If we consider further that the creative spirit advances from the great depth of space suggested by his mantle, which is formed like a gigantic shell, we come to think of the Waters of the Abyss and the emanation of soul substance, frequently described as a watery element in the mythologies and metaphysical systems af mankind.This fresco depicts a stage prior to the creation of man. Three cherubim are half hidden in the cosmic cloak, as though foreshadowing the Holy Trinity. And, as though he embodied the World Soul, the figure of God the Father with his powerful hands fills almost the entire space. Michelangelo's realism, fed on the astonishing symbiosis of the Middle Ages and Antiquity, perfectly expressed the place, the task and destiny of man during his journey back to the source of being. His art illustrates the incarnation of the spirit, free will, and the perversely self imposed fetters of guilt and evil. However much melancholia assailed him, aware as he was of the flaw in creation, in the Sistina he has contributed to the world's deliverance. Whoever studies Michelangelo's frescoes there does something towards his own purification

This scene is vividly depicted in the last fresco of the northeast wall. Soldiers with their upright spears and lances, officers on horses, and several citizens form a compact wall of people around the saint, who kneels on the ground deep in prayer. Above the saint's lowered head, the executioner raises his sword and is readying himself to deliver the deadly blow.Here Altichiero shows most  interestingly the influence of Giotto in the solidity of his groups of figures posed in large natural spaces. He achieves brilliant results with this technique, softened by Gothic details. In addition to this, the Veronese painter took pains to portray everyday feelings.

05100-selfport.jpg	Until recent years the painting was attributed to Ludovico Carracci. However, in 1992 it was identified as the self-portrait of Orazio Borgianni on the basis of typological and stylistic similarities to the known portraits of that painter. Two self portraits of Borgianni are cited in the 1638 inventory of the Giustiniani collection, and in the will and testament of the painter. The rapid and essential brushstroke, with its almost impressionistic effect, contributes considerably to the lively expressiveness of the portrait and to the immediacy of its psychological qualities.This portrait should fall chronologically between the two other known portraits of Borgianni; the luxuriant and healthy face of 1614 and the emaciated and febrile face that must date to just before the artist's death in 1616. In this picture, Borgianni's face is at an intermediary stage as the artist's illness is just beginning to show its effects. On the other hand, the accentuated baldness of the sitter in the Rome canvas would suggest a dating later than both the other portraits. On the basis of these conflicting considerations, seems best to date the execution of this self-portrait to 1615. Such a date makes sense stylistically, as the painting corresponds well with Borgianni's late phase, characterized by dense handling of the pictorial material, the dark shadows and almost monochrome palette

33416-39newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 578.It is to the biblical pictures that we must turn to see Rembrandt's greatest contribution during his mature period. The deepening of the religious content of these works is connected with some shift in his choice of biblical subjects. During the 1630s Rembrandt had used the Bible as a source for dramatic motifs; for example, the Blinding of Samson. In his middle phase he turned to more calm and intimate subjects, particularly episodes from the life of the Holy Family. At the beginning of the mature period the figure of Christ becomes pre-eminent. Scenes taken from the life of Jesus, quiet episodes of his youth, his preaching and the deeds of his early manhood, and his resurrection form the main subject of the biblical representations.The emergence of the mature style is marked by works like Christ at Emmaus, in which Rembrandt expresses the character of Jesus without any concrete action or noisy stage-like effect. A moment before, he appeared to be merely a man about to break bread with two pilgrims. Now he is the resurrected Christ whose tender presence fills the room. Without any commotion, Rembrandt convinces us that we are witnessing the moment when the eyes of the pilgrims are no longer 'held, that they should not recognize him'. A great calm and a magic atmosphere prevail, and we are drawn into the sacred mood of the scene by the most sensitive suggestion of the emotion of the figures, as well as by the mystery of light which envelops them. The monumental architectonic setting lends grandeur and structure to the composition, and the powerful emptiness of the architectural background is enlivened by the fluctuating, transparent chiaroscuro and the tender spiritual character of the light around Christ himself. A simple pathos and a mild, warm feeling emanate from his figure. Nothing could be farther from the conspicuous theatricality of the works of the thirties.Rembrandt returned several times to the theme of the Supper at Emmaus, which explores the double nature of Christ, His humanity and His essential divinity. Rembrandt interpreted the theme in a different way each time; the composition of this version relies on Italian Renaissance examples and is one of the artist's most serenely classical masterpieces

29517-madonna.jpg	Neroccio's style remains almost unchanged in his several compositions presenting the Madonna with Child and Saints. The drawing is always perceptibly subtle and light, the colours do not glow with varnish, but enchant with their unlacquered, milky opaque effect. This painter, stemming from a distinguished patrician family, seems to have wanted throughout his life to express the nobility of the human face and the elegance of gestures and attitudes in his paintings. He did not make use of many innovations of the first half of the 15th century, and in fact one has the impression as if Neroccio, forgetting about his direct artistic antecedents, had intended to reach back to traditions of the previous century. And yet in fact he knew and employed the devices of perspective and used light and shadow in the modelling of his figures, but he was less interested in these. Neroccio had no wish to deny the two-dimensisonal quality of the surface he painted, and the application of foreshortening and the adding of depth to his composition concerned him only as long and inasmuch as they contributed to the harmonious effect of the composition as a whole. In the light that brushed the faces and hands he did not look for a method to achieve plastic unity and compactness, but rather for a means to expose as much of the beauties of detail as possible and to make the pictorial surface as rich as possible

15913-madon_fr.jpg	The altar-piece, called the Castelfranco Madonna, was in all probability commissioned by the Condottiere Tuzio Costanzo in memory of his son Matteo, who died in 1504: the Costanzo coat of arms can be seen on the base of the Virgin's throne. It can almost certainly be dated to 1505. Although it is not signed, the authorship is made indisputable by Giorgione's individual technique in laying on delicately shaded coats of paint without any underlying scaffolding from a drawing. The traditional scheme of composition is lightened by the novel use of such elements as the throne and the landscape, which takes up a good portion of the background.This smallish altarpiece echoes the artistic approach developed by Giovanni Bellini, who was probably one of Giorgione's teachers. Giorgione softens both the atmosphere surrounding the figures and that in the space before the viewer. This atmospheric veil has a palpable analogy with the methods of Leonardo da Vinci, who was known to have been in Venice in 1500 and it is possible that Giorgione had seen some works by the Florentine genius. Yet the figural proportions and the lacy landscape speak to a fully personal Giorgionesque idiom

11694-4magnol.jpg	The work, signed and dated about 1445, comes from the Florentine church of Santa Lucia dei Magnoli and shows the Madonna enthroned with Child among the saints (left to right) Francis, John the Baptist (whose face is the self-portrait of the painter), Zenobius and Lucy. The sacra conversazione is placed in a completely Renaissance architectural setting, where the perspective study get perfection with the foreshortening of the floor. The natural light and the absence of gold on the backgrond of the picture, make this altarpiece one of the first achievements of the new Renaissance art.The traditional tricusped frame of Gothic triptychs is transformed in the Magnoli Altarpiece into an elegant loggia decorated with lovely marble intarsia. Sheltered by this construction stands the throne, with the Madonna and Child and four saints. Each one of these characters has his own physical and moral individuality, conveyed not only by the very sculptural relief with which the beautiful faces are drawn, but also by the precise position they hold within the space so clearly defined by the architectural structure.If we compare this painting with the Berlin Adoration of the Magi, painted about five years earlier, we can see how Domenico's palette has changed: the dark and bright colours in the Berlin tondo, a legacy from Gentile and Pisanello, have been replaced by lighter colours and more delicate hues. But what really stands out in the Uffizi altarpiece is the presence of this pale and delicate light coming from a natural source, like an open window with a ray of warm sunlight streaming in, lighting up the peaceful composition and creating a shadow against the background, as evidence of its existence. This particular idea of lighting is Domenico's greatest debt to the art of Fra Angelico, and also one of his most extraordinary and original achievements

30661-relief.jpg	In 1630 the count-duke of Olivares decided to initiate a lavish program of artistic display by the construction of a new pleasure palace on the eastern border of Madrid which came to be known as the Buen Retiro. Here theatrical plays and spectacles would be staged, tournaments and jousts would be organized, and painting, sculpture, and tapestry would be displayed. Beginning in 1630 with a modest renovation of the royal apartment in San Jer�nimo, the project was expanded in 1632 and again in 1633, culminating in a sizable complex of buildings surrounded by enormous gardens adorned by fountains, alleys and hermitage chapels. Once the structure was finished, Olivares faced with the mammoth problem of decorating the new palace, a problem that was solved by hundreds of pictures from Italy and Flanders and by commissioning as many works from local artists as they could paint. As for the works by royal artists and their disciples, the decoration of the Retiro was the major event of the 1630s and thus is a microcosm of court painting during the decade.The Hall of Realms was the principal ceremonial room in the Buen Retiro Palace. Spanish palace decoration during the reign of Philip IV tended to be loosely programmed in comparison with Italian examples. However, the paintings in the Hall of realms, executed in 1634-35, offer an exception to the rule, for her the count-duke Olivares and his advisers invented a coherent, if straightforward program designed to magnify the power of the Spanish monarchy.The principal element are twelve paintings of important military victories of Philip IV's reign, which demonstrate the invincibility of Spanish arms. These are complemented by ten scenes of the life of Hercules, who was claimed by the Spanish Habsburgs (and virtually every other ruling house of Europe) as the founding ancestor of the dynasty. The final component is a group of equestrian portraits  of Philip III and Margaret of Austria, Philip IV and Isabella of Bourbon, and the heir to the throne, Baltasar Carlos, which embodies the idea of dynastic legitimacy and succession. From the 27 paintings the largest share went to Francisco de Zurbar�n, who painted the Hercules scenes and the Defence of Cadiz. Vel�zquez obtained all five equestrian portraits and the Surrender of Breda. Vicente Carducho obtained the commission for three battle painting, while his pupil F�lix Castelo was awarded one. Eugenio Caj�s and his assistants and followers were given four subjects. The two remaining works fell into the hands of Juan Bautista Maino and Antonio de Pereda. The The Relief of Genoa is Pereda's contribution.Pereda had an extraordinary facility in the genre of still-life. In certain passages of the battle painting, particularly in the silvery reflections of the pikemen's armour, he employs the same microscopic vision as in his still-lifes. However, the rest of the composition falls into the pattern used by the older court artists working on the decoration of the Buen Retiro. In fact, there is a marked similarity between the figure styles of Pereda and Carducho

30334-mystic_m.jpg	It is the oldest dated work securely attributed to Pietro Paolini, the problematic Lucchese painter. Documented as having been baptized in 1603, Paolini began working with Angelo Caroselli in Rome between 1619 and 1629. The National Gallery canvas, painted immediately after his return to his native city from a Venetian sojourn of 1629-31, offers a lucid synthesis of Paolini's defining artistic experiences up to this point.The composition of the canvas is characterized by a distinct division between the upper and lower parts of the picture: the two zones are so different that they almost seem to be the works of two different painters. The two saints in the foreground, Saints Dominic and Francis, of extraordinary quality, fully reflect the new Roman cultural climate defined by Caravaggio: they are close to Caroselli's prototypes, though interpreted with a more monumental and idealizing dimension that distances them from the manner of Paolini's master. The upper part, meanwhile, showing the Virgin enthroned between saints, looks back to the traditions of Roman classicism as well as the artist's more recent experience of Venetian renaissance art

00795-perugia.jpg	The picture shows the Perugia Altarpiece in a modern, early twentieth-century frame. The left and centre predella panels are copies of originals now in the Pinacoteca, Vatican.The altarpiece is one of Angelico's most beautiful paintings. Until recently it was believed that its patron was Benedetto Guidalotti (1388-1429), archbishop of Recanati. New research, however, indicates instead that his sister Elisabetta (died 1460) may have been responsible for the project. Prominently located in the transept of San Domenico, the triptych conveyed the devotion of the Guidalotti to the Virgin and the saints worshipped in the church.

26627-00_3pr1.jpg	On entering the Chapel (generally through the east door, for contrary to prevalent custom the altar with the 'Last Judgment' occupies the west wall), one can see the Prophet Zechariah enthroned above. In ecclesiastical tradition Zechariah is young, but Michelangelo painted him as a man hoary with age, with a long beard and an ample green cloak, perhaps indicative of the unfathomable depth of his prophecies. This may be the earliest figure; it is extremely powerful but still somewhat clumsy, hardly suggesting a being who has received illumination. The old man is reading from his book, perhaps reciting the passages on the reconstruction of the temple, which he advocated.Some scholars thought that Julius II and his counselors took it as a reference to the rebuilding of Saint Peter's. Zechariah prophesied the coming of a king riding into Jerusalem on a donkey, that is, Palm Sunday; and the Descent of the Holy Ghost, the Pentecost - both of which played a prominent part in the Church ritual of the Vatican. A crest with the oak of the della Rovere is placed on the console of Zechariah. Twin genii peer over the shoulder of the Prophet with the book.Zechariah was one of the twelve 'lesser' prophets. Michelangelo chose two more, Joel and Jonah, from among them, in addition to the four major prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel. The remaining thrones are occupied by five of the twelve traditional Sibyls

44032-2columb.jpg	The picture shows the Adoration of the Magi, the central panel of the altarpiece executed for the St Columba church in Cologne.The composition of the central panel demonstrates a masterly balance between freedom and discipline. The Virgin and Child are shifted slightly to the left of the middle axis, which appears to run through the central pillar and down into the hat of the kneeling king. In fact, however, even these two details lie slightly left of centre. This left-hand bias is compensated by the figures of the second kneeling king and the third, youngest king, visually strongly accented by his expansively angled pose. The asymmetrical ruins of the stable correspond precisely to the composition of the main group. Insofar as Rogier arranges his figures from left to right in the style of a relief and orients his architecture parallel to the pictorial plane, he remains true to the principles underlying his Descent from the Cross. Here, however, he displays a more sovereign mastery of the organic structuring of the human figure and the partial creation of spatial depth.The anachronistic little crucifix at the centre of the picture anticipates the purpose of Christ's life on earth, His act of redemption. The donor, with a rosary, kneels on the extreme left, divided from the rest of the scene by a small wall

09035-10muses.jpg	In the last decade of his life, Claude concentrated on a limited number of themes, many of them from Virgil's Aeneid. The Apollo and the Muses on Mount Helion (Parnassus) of 1680 in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is a good example of his use of idyllic mythology during his last years. His technique remained as refined as in his earlier years, but his compositions often lost the earlier sense of perfect balance in the trees of different sizes and densities on each side of the picture. Sometimes, as in the Boston picture, the whole appears rather awkward, especially in reproductions which tend to emphasize the patterns made by the landscape against the sky. In front of the original, however, these awkwardnesses disappear because one becomes aware that the artist is concentrating entirely on atmosphere, to the exclusion of everything else.The mythological story depicted on the picture is the following.Apollo, as the God of Poetry and Music (in this role named Apollo Musagetes), dwells on Mount Parnassus, accompanied by the muses, the goddesses of poetic inspiration and the creative arts in general. The running brook is the Castilian spring, which, like another, the Pierian, was a source of inspiration and learning where we are advised to drink deep.The painting was executed for the Principe Colonna, and was in the family collection until at least 1783. It is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 193)

16989-nuenen04.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 27, JH 503.In Nuenen between January and August 1884, van Gogh depicted the figure of the weaver working at the loom in several pen drawings, watercolours and oil paintings. In this small village of Northern-Brabant, to where his parents moved in September 1882, more than four hundred people took up weaving, an activity of domestic industry during the winter months, when agricultural labour was suspended.The chronology of the series could be determined by the development in representing the loom. As time went by, van Gogh depicted the loom with more and more precision, abandoning the anecdotal elements and concentrating on the work process and on the machine itself.In the present version the machine depicted in a narrow, dark place is virtually imprisoning the weaver, the geometrical elements appear as prison bars. The worker's face is devoid of expression and his head appears to be shut in a guillotine. Whereas the artist's earlier weaver pictures were characterized by stronger colour contrasts, here the darker brownish tones play the leading role

02763-thr_swan.jpg	Asselyn's early works, dated 1634 and 1635, are little views of ferocious cavalry skirmishes which suggest he was apprenticed to Jan Marsten the Younger, a Haarlem battle painter who was a pupil and follower of Esaias van de Velde. Soon afterwards he was said to have travelled to Rome and remained there until about 1643-44. No painting can be documented to his Roman sojourn but on the basis of stylistic evidence a sufficient number establish he was there, and had close contact with the Bamboccianti as well as an opportunity to take a hard look at Claude's landscapes. Additionally, he made drawings, often animated with wash, of the grand and modest sights of Rome.Asselyn returned to the Netherlands via France where he married in Lyon in 1644-45. Then he moved to Paris where he worked with Swanevelt. By 1647 he was in Amsterdam where he spent the remaining five years of his life. During the brief period he specialized in Italian views saturated with silvery and golden atmospheric effect; he was one of the first to bring Claude's pure and light way of painting landscapes to Holland. He also painted winter and night scenes and views of his native land, and pictures of animals and birds as well. His Threatened Swan depicts a life-size swan defending its nest against a dog swimming towards it.With menacingly outspread wings, the swan is vigorously defending its nest against the dog swimming up from the left. The scattered feathers and the low angle from which the bird is viewed emphasize its fury.The painting was transformed at a later date into an allegory on the vigilance of the Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt by inscriptions added by an unknown hand: under the swan 'De Raad-Pensionarie' (the Grand Pensionary); on one of the eggs in the nest 'Holland'; and above the dog, 'de viand van de Staat' (the enemy of the State). Thus the swan was meant to represent the Grand Pensionary protecting Holland. The enemy was presumably De Witt's adversary, England

32253-05sabin1.jpg	Although Poussin spent almost the whole of his working life in Rome, he was the greatest as well as the most influential painter of 17th-century France. His authoritative interpretations of ancient history and Greek and Roman mythology left their mark on European art down to the time of David and Ingres. Here he shows Romulus, ruler of the newly founded city of Rome, giving a prearranged signal with his cloak for the Roman soldiers to carry off the Sabine women to become their wives, thereby establishing themselves permanently in their new home. The Sabine men, who had come unarmed to what they thought would be a religious celebration, are put to flight. The subject enabled Poussin to display to the full his unsurpassed archaeological knowledge and his mastery of dramatic interpretation

05421-ruins.jpg	Many of the Dutch Italianate painters concentrated less on actual Italian themes than on the bright Mediterranean light. There was evidently a demand in the 17th century for paintings of shepherds and cattle in an imaginary and hilly foreign land in which enthusiasts undoubtedly recognized Arcadia. Jan Both, Nicolaes Berchem, Karel Dujardin, Jan Asselyn and Adam Pynacker were masters of the genre.There are several versions of this typical Italianete landscape by Both (in Dresden, Richmond etc.)

24845-altar.jpg	At the end of the fifteenth century the French court favoured the Flemish style. At that time the most important painter in France was the Master of Moulins, whose identity has still not been established. He was a court painter in the service of the king and the Duke of Bourbon, and he travelled between the capital and Burgundy. In spite of his Flemish training and the influence of Hugo van der Goes, his style is French; this is particularly evident in his use of ample forms of a clear-cut and elegant modelling and in his aristocratic quality.The Master of Moulins represents the last percussions of the influence of Hugo van der Goes, and does so with exceptional vigour and grandeur. In the triptych in Moulins Cathedral the Virgin and Child are surrounded by a garland of angels lit from the radiance emanating from the glory against which they are seated, with the most magical effects of light. In the wings, Duke Pierre II of Bourbon, with a rueful countenance, faces his formidable wife, of whom he was said to have been the humble servant rather than the husband. The painter's gift for characterization is carried a stage beyond the normal by his habit of repeating the features of his sitters in the faces of their patron saints. His colour is of an astonishing brilliance; his forms of great elegance

38086-shipping.jpg	Although some specialists in marine painting who worked during the last decades of the 17th century are not without interest - among them Abraham Storck who painted imaginary Mediterranean ports - neither they nor Bakhuizen were able to maintain the high standard set by van de Cappelle and Willem van de Velle the Younger. In the late marine paintings, over-agitation and overly emphatic contrasts take the place of subtle co-ordination. The perspective effect is overdone, and the tonal designs harden. As in the work made at the beginning of the century, novelties and anecdotal tendencies become more important than the impression of nature. Too many things happen in the late seascapes. In the tempests, stormy seas and dramatic skies compete as rivals for our attention, and in the calms, a minute realism overburdens them with detail

41107-09vision.jpg	In a mandala of two concentric circle-shaped rainbows the Almighty is seated upon a throne crowned with a stone canopy in front of which are seven burning lamps. God is surrounded by four winged creatures covered with eyes: a lion, a bull, an eagle and a man. Between the two rainbows are seated twenty-four elders `robed in white and wearing gold crowns'. They are playing the viol and the harp while the lamb is about to clasp the sealed book between its forefeet. All this is a literal though simplified rendering of Revelation 4:2-7. At bottom left sits John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos and to the right the donors, Hermann Scherfgin, councillor and burgomaster of Cologne, and his wife Bela Hirsch, are witnessing the vision.The work was created c. 1450 and was probably intended for St Laurenz's Church in Cologne, where the principals had a priedieu. The anonymous master is referred to as the Master of the Vision of St John.The composition of the apocalyptic vision is in keeping with the Cologne tradition.

33235-cardoon.jpg	This painting derives from a composition by Juan S�nchez Cot�n (Still Life with Cardoon and Francolin, Princeton, Piasecka Johnson Collection) who was one of the originators of still-life painting in Spain. Although his powerful example continued to exercise its influence upon still-life painters in Toledo and Madrid during the first third of the 17th century, few artists responded in such a literal manner as Ram�rez did on this occasion. The lateral elements of the painting are copied from S�nchez Cot�n's prototype, while the central motifs appear to have been added by Ram�rez. S�nchez Cot�n's original painting does not contain the irises and grapes that are present in this still life. Ram�rez appears to have taken S�nchez Cot�n's painting as his model, to have elaborated on it by inserting new elements into the composition and to have signed it as his own invention. By filling the magical void in the prototype, Ram�rez shows himself to have been the more prosaic master

44725-farnese5.jpg	In the two rooms on the piano nobile suited for a larger public, the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani and the Sala del Concilio, Taddeo Zuccaro painted a cycle depicting, in a total of twenty-three scenes, the history of the Farnese family.The depiction of events from family history already had a long tradition in the Farnese family. Vasari painted a cycle in the Cancellaria, Rome, and Salviati in the Palazzo Farnese, Rome. Yet no cycle of paintings before Caprarola had depicted the history of the Farnese in such an extensive manner, from medieval times up to the present day.The Sala del Concilio, the room connecting to the large Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani, is dedicated entirely to the deeds of Paul III. The ceiling shows the coronation of the pope in the centre, surrounded by four further events.The walls rehearse a series of the pope's acts that had already been depicted in the Cancellaria or in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. Four large scenes are depicted on the four walls of the rectangular room: Paul III Receives Charles V on His Victorious Return from Tunis; Paul III Appoints Cardinals; Paul III Makes Peace between Charles V and Francis I in Nice in 1538; and Paul III Opens the Council of Trent in 1546.The picture shows the scene of Paul III Opens the Council of Trent in 1546.

07829-matthew.jpg	There are also two paintings in the Scuola di San Giorgio degli Schiavoni that are not part of the cycle, the Agony in the Garden and the Calling of Matthew, dated 1502.The Calling of Matthew is much closer to the last episodes of the St Ursula cycle than Agony in the Garden, especially in the precise construction of the colour planes within a composition that is almost exactly similar to that of Giovan Battista Cima's Miracle of St Mark, a work painted around 1499 and now in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin. The scene is not set in Capharnaum, but on the Venetian mainland, as we can see from the style of the gate and the buildings around the square, where Matthew, responding to the calling of Jesus Christ and the Apostles, abandons his post as tax-collector (the receipts attached to his worktable indicate that that was indeed his job). Notice the typical wooden parasols placed so as to keep the sunlight off the worktop.

18365-1516grec.jpg	El Greco treated this subject of Christ on the Cross several times throughout his career. The present version is one of only three surviving large-scale versions of this composition. In it El Greco has chosen to use the 'Cristo Vivo' iconography, in which the Christ figure is shown alive and without indication of His suffering or wounds. The original source for the figure is almost certainly a drawing by Michelangelo that was commissioned by Vittoria Colonna and is today in the British Museum. He most probably knew this particular design from a print, a notion supported by the reversal of the figure of Christ in the painting from the original drawing.The present painting exists in numerous autograph and studio versions in both large and reduced format

22508-7erato.jpg	This idyllic, playful composition, which has been considered the allegory of music for a long time, intimates complicated relationships. Nothing seems to indicate, however, that it belongs to one of a series of paintings symbolizing the seven liberal arts. We have no certain data on its original purpose.The painting probably shows the Muse Erato leading a swan by a golden leash. The swan, an attribute of Apollo, may be associated with Musica as well; its symbolic role is based on the fact that it miraculously sang before its death; thus the concept of the swan song.There is a lyre of a peculiar form in the painting. Such a fantastic instrument more than likely would have been unsuitable for playing. Its frame is a head of a stag, and the strings are stretched across the cross-bands mounted on the antlers. The painter even placed a piece of bone next to it. The stag has been used by painters to represent Hearing because of its keen ears; thus it may be connected with the concept of music.It is proposed that in the form of a winged putto even Zephyrus may have a role in the depiction of music, since the swans sing only when the mild western wind blows, while the musicians require a certain breath of personal glory to inspire them to play. The putti who play with the swan, on the other hand, may belong to a third female figure, Leda. Jupiter, in the form of a swan, seduced her, and their love bore two sets of twins, although in paintings usually only two children are depicted. This detail reveals that Leonardo da Vinci's painting - lost and only known from copies - influenced Lippi

24889-triptyc1.jpg	In the Middle Ages the same stories were constantly depicted anew within the culture of prayer. In Late Medieval art, however, the focus narrowed to a few specific themes and motifs. The devotional images were distilled from a larger context (e.g. the Piet&#224; from the Lamentation). Despite all the innovations in the stock of images, the traditional Madonna and Crucifixion, (which are also themes derived from a narrative) remained the most popular. Many of the small Late Medieval paintings of the Virgin and Child were augmented with secondary figures, with the result that the old theme began telling a new story. This is exemplified by this charming little painting of the Cologne Scholl.The shape of the triptych undoubtedly derived from Italian art, but all its other features place it firmly within the tradition of painting in Cologne. They include the bodyless figures, whose existence is determined solely by the undulating movement of their robes. The rich, full tonality lends weight to these mild-mannered forms. Even Jesus's tormentors in the scene of the Mocking of Christ cannot ruffle the mood of serenity.The two saints seated on either side of the Virgin are John the Evangelist with the chalice (left) and John the Baptist with Lamb of God, which is to be sacrificed. The Virgin's most striking attendants are the four elegant ladies in the foreground. They are the four holy noblewomen, who, particularly in Cologne art, often appear as the Virgin's close friends. On the left is St Barbara with her tower, and beside her St Christine with the millstone with which she was martyred. Across from her sits Princess Catherine with her wheel and sword, who is looking at Mary Magdalene holding the jar of ointment with which she anointed the dead Christ.The left wing has two scenes from Christ's Passion and death, and on the right wing we see His triumph over death at the Resurrection the Ascension.The central panel of this triptych is widely considered to be autograph; the wings may have been made in the master's workshop

It depicts a standing boy on the left, his back turned towards the viewer and averting his eyes as a seated greybeard raises an admonishing forefinger to the right.Naaman was a commander of the army of Syria. He was a good commander but he suffered from leprosy. Naaman's wife had a servant girl from Israel who said that a prophet there would be able to heal him. Naaman tells his lord this and he is sent to Israel with a letter to the king. The king of Israel didn't know what to do, yet Elisha came to the king asking to see Naaman. Elisha advised Naaman to bathe seven times in the river Jordan. Although sceptical, Naaman was convinced to do as Elisha had counseled him, and he was cured. Out of gratitude he offered Elisha six talents of silver, but the prophet refused. His servant Gehazi, on the other hand, considered that Elisha may have insulted Naaman by his refusal, followed him and asked for two Talents and some clothes, which he was duly given, and hid in his house. When questioned by Elisha he denied everything, infuriating his master, who saw through his servant and struck him down with Naaman's disease.

18902-01aurora.jpg	The Casino dell'Aurora is the only portion spared from nineteenth-century demolition of the Villa Ludovisi (later Villa Boncompagni Ludovisi) in Rome. Originally the Casino, erected around 1570 and enlarged in the nineteenth century, was a three-story structure on a cruciform ground plan. During the pontificate of Pope Gregory XV Ludovisi the villa and its casino were used mainly for official functions such as dinners for the college of cardinals. The Casino was decorated by paintings on the ground floor and the second floor in the seventeenth century.The ceiling of the central room on the ground floor was painted by Guercino depicting Aurora on Her Triumphal Chariot. This composition was a deliberate response to Guido Reni's Aurora in the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome. Guercino's coworker was Agostino Tassi who was responsible for the architecture (quadratura) painted in fresco technique. (Guercino painted in tempera instead of fresco.)In its combination of heraldic and allegorical elements, the pictorial program in the Casino dell'Aurora anticipates the pictorial idiom later perfected by Pietro da Cortona in the Palazzo Barberini

16950-2portina.jpg	This large triptych is the most important work of the Flemish artist Hugo van der Goes, constituting the basis for a reconstruction of the artist's entire oeuvre. It was painted in Bruges and was commissioned to the artist by Tommaso Portinari, an agent of the Medicean bank who resided in the city with his family The painting was intended for the high altar of Sant' Egidio, the church of the Arcispedale of Santa Maria Nuova founded in 1288 by the banker's ancestor Folco Portinari. Shipped from Bruges by sea, with the financial aid of the banker Niccol&#242; di Giovanni Capponi, it arrived in Pisa by way of Sicily. The painting was then transported along the Arno and finally completed its tortuous journey at the Porta San Frediano in Florence on 28 May 1483. From here it was carried to its destination by sixteen strong porters under the surveillance of Meo di Tingo, an envoy of the Arcispedale. In 1567 the triptych was dismembered.When the work arrived in Florence, it immediately caused a sensation among the people and attracted a considerable following among contemporary artists. The triptych had an enormous impact, noticeably influencing the art of manuscript illustration in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries as well as illustrious representatives of Umbrian painting like Luca Signorelli

26272-07menzel.jpg	Menzel's oils of the 1850s and 1860s presented dazzling tableaux of a vastly wealthy, conspicuously refined Potsdam court under Frederick the Great (1712-1786), depicted as if on the same gargantuan plane as Versailles, in a Prussian palace more French than the one near Paris. Canvases such as A Flute Concert were images the monarch may have wished painted in his own day, yet none of his artists were up to this task.The Flute Concert depicts the king playing the flute in his music room at Sanssouci. He was a gifted musician who played the transverse flute. He composed 100 sonatas for the flute as well as four symphonies. His court musicians included C. P. E. Bach, Johann Joachim Quantz, and Franz Benda. A meeting with Johann Sebastian Bach in 1747 in Potsdam led to Bach writing The Musical Offering.

Documents demonstrate that a range of patrons sought his work throughout the 1420s.

23638-altar0.jpg	Benedetto da Maiano's tomb altar is located in a chapel erected to house the relics of St Fina. The chapel was build by the architect Giuliano da Maiano (1432-1490), the elder brother of Benedetto; it was completed in 1472. The same year Benedetto was commissioned by the city council of San Gimignano to create a tomb for the saint.The creation of Benedetto has an unusual form: part tomb monument, part reliquary shrine, part altar. This reflects the unusual nature of San Gimignano's veneration of the Fina relics. Fina was worshiped as a local saint, but since she had not been canonized she could not be honoured with an altar of his own. Her bones could not be placed beneath the altar table for the same reason. Her head had been separated from the rest of her remains in the fourteenth century, and it was placed in the tabenacle-like opening of the retable - possibly in the shrine created in 1402. Her body lies in a sarcophagus elevated above the retable. The combination of a sarcophagus and a Madonna tondo makes one think of this as a tomb monument; however, the frieze atop the retable is more typical of an altar predella, which the work was in fact long thought to be

03408-02emmaus.jpg	"Although undated, the painting is likely to go back to about 1538, a particularly felicitous period in Jacopo Bassano's art.Lorenzetti (1911) places it in the early part of the artist's stay in Bonifacio da Pitati's workshop and pointed out the obvious links with the latter's painting on the same theme, now to be seen in the Brera. There is a certain contrast between the solemn, hieratic figure of Christ and the rough and realistic close-up of the innkeeper on the one hand, and on the other, the little scene of the crouching dog being teased by the cat from a distance. The postures of the two disciples, the laboured perspective of the table, and some genre episodes were to recur in his later ""Supper"" version, now in the Borghese Gallery, Rome. The still-life in the centre of the work standing but against the linen tablecloth is a marvel of pictorial observation.

14474-405fried.jpg	Friedrich was preoccupied by the passage of time. The ages of man are mirrored by the seasonal cycle, and his vivid representations of winter snow and leafless trees contain the promise of spring growth, as in The Oak Tree in the Snow, which is both an image of striking naturalism and a complex allegory, painted late in Friedrich's life in a mood of retrospection. The German oak, a symbol of strength, is cruelly chopped and denuded, like Germany itself for much of the painter's life; its dead branches speak of a lost past. Yet at its roots spring new leaves, and the blue sky, reflected in the icy water, brings hope of renewal. This picture needs no figures, for the oak is really a collective figure of the German people.Oak trees run like a leitmotif throughout Friedrich's oeuvre, often in conjunction with a dolmen. They are a reminder of the artist's personal roots and are at the same time charged with nationalist sentiment.

26703-lu05zer.jpg	"""Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel. Zerubbabel begat Abiud. Abiud begat Eliakim."" (Matthew 1:12-13)The tablets in a number of lunettes bear three names: in these cases one of the three refers to the group depicted in the spandrel above. Except for the four corner spandrels the spandrels form part of the sequence of the ancestors of Christ.In the absence of any information, the identities suggested for the figures are hypothetical. The arrangement of the figures seems to be inspired by the quest for symmetrical correspondence. A man and a woman, both accompanied by a child are seen sideways on; they are seated with their backs to each other, but turn their heads toward the viewer, their gazes fixed on the same point. Bareheaded, her legs covered by a yellow mantle, the woman hugs a child wrapped in a red shawl with white stripes.The intensity of the colours in the group on the left is counterbalanced on the right by darker tones. Enveloped in a violet cloak and wearing a wide green hat adorned with a yellow ribbon, the man turns, his face less sullen than those of some of the other figures in the lunettes. The child is clinging to the man as if he wishes to attract his attention, with an expression of slight anxiety on his face"

Yet it is likely that these pairs of panels initially were joined to one another by attached hinges.

These are strict profile portraits facing one another. Ghirlandaio's husband and wife are not rulers but high ranking members of Florentine society.
