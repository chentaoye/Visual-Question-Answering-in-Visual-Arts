18850-a_weepin.jpg	In this picture, pure red and blue in the angel's sleeve and the sky, and pure white and black paint, are intermixed and blended with an earth colour to produce a wonderful range of ashen violets and misty ochres, against which the body of Christ on his luminous shroud glows like a golden-tinged pearl. The subject is a free version of the traditional Venetian theme of two angels holding up the dead Christ beside his tomb for the viewer's pious meditation; it does not illustrate any biblical text. The wounds of Christ are discreetly suggested. Pathos arises from the juxtaposition of beauty with grief, of close observation in the studio with poetic invention, and the borderline between them is as blurred as the melting contours between flesh and stone, feather and cloud

It was suggested - not convincingly - that the Portrait of a Monk in the Louvre, which has approximately the same size, formed the right wing.Both the Virgin and the Child bear some resemblance to their counterparts in Michelangelo's Bruges Madonna, particularly in the sweet but somber countenance of the Virgin and the twisted torso of the Child.

21479-angelica.jpg	Angelica is the daughter of a king of Cathay in Orlando Furioso, by the Italian poet Ariosto (1474-1533), a romantic epic poem about the conflict between Christians and Saracens at the time of Charlemagne. Angelica was loved by several knights, Christian and pagan, among them the Christian hero Orlando (Roland). He was maddened (furioso) with grief and jealousy because she became the lover of, and eventually married, the Moor Medoro.In this painting, in front of a landscape, Medoro carves the name of his beloved onto a tree.

19803-shrimp_g.jpg	"Hogarth originally wanted to become a history painter, but this ambition seems to have been thwarted by a singular lack of interest on the part of his contemporaries. Posterity, too, has chosen to remember a very different Hogarth. He characterized the individual personalities of his sitters, revealed the unique within the typical, and in his tongue-in-cheek portrayals of human nature he documented the social mores of the age in areas beyond the sphere of the ""historic"" event. Then, as now, he was regarded as the painter of the private, the forgotten and the overlooked.In the improvised composition of this oil sketch of The Shrimp Girl, we see Hogarth's painterly talent at its very finest. Here, he succeeds in creating a spontaneous reiteration of his observations with all the impact of a first impression. The freshness of the moment is not transposed here into a smooth painterly technique, but is echoed in the vigorous and fleeting brushwork.This spontaneous and fresh study recalls the style of Frans Hals and it can be considered a precursor of Impressionism"

22587-4madonna.jpg	"Lippi probably received the commission for this painting from Monsignor Vitelleschi, the Archbishop of Florence from 1435 to 1437. Vitelleschi owned a palace at Corneto, and had close family ties to that city's Augustinian convent of San Marco, where Lippi's Madonna and Child seems to have once been housed. As a dated work it is an important monument for the reconstruction of Lippi's career. (The painting is dated on a card at the base of the throne which reads ""A. D. M. MCCCCXXXVII"")The painting is characterized by its spatial and perspectival structure, and a plastic quality in the figures that directly recalls the work of Masaccio. It documents a precise phase of the artists career before the influence of Fra Angelico became prevalent and before the artist began to distance himself from his interest in perspectival space.  Lippi painted this work after his return from North Italy, where more consistent contacts with French, German, and Netherlandish painting can be assumed. The close affinity between Lippi's style in this period and Flemish painting has led some scholars to hypothesize a voyage to Flanders in around 1435. If indeed Lippi did make such a trip, he would have come into direct contact with the work of Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden.The figures are substantial, especially the Child, whose large head, thick limbs, and heavy trunk are almost grotesque, as is the Child's inexplicable pose. The Madonna, with her nearly round head, a characteristic type for Lippi, her rigid right arm and squarish, stumpy hands with short fingers, and the ponderous, almost exaggerated draperies continue in his art. The perspective is also somewhat forced, but the sharply foreshortened upper shutter of the window is adventurous. Another effective feature of the painting is the vigorous light and shadow used both for building forms and for illumination within the interior space, although the source of light is not consistently distributed"

Her father lead the Greek forces against Troy. The expedition was at first prevented from sailing by unfavourable winds, so Agamemnon consulted a seer, Calchas. He was told that, because he had killed a stag sacred to Diana, he must propitiate the goddess by sacrificing his daughter to her. Iphigenia accepted her fate out of patriotic motives.

16471-4crucif1.jpg	The crucifix was first attributed to Giotto by Lorenzo Ghiberti, who in his Commentaries quoted other works of the master in the altars of the church of Ognissanti, like the Virgin of Ognissanti and the Dormitio Virginis. Originally it was probably located on the presbytery, dominating the nave and the faithful, near the Virgin of Ognissanti.In poor condition, it was kept in a room adjacent to the basilica and attributed to an artist close to Giotto and possessing great pictorial capacities.The work was restored from 2005 onwards by Opificio delle pietre dura from Florence and was attributed to Giotto himself, for a date which is around 1315. On November 6, 2010, the crucifix was reinstalled inside the left transept, enhanced by proper illumination.Intended for the procession, it is in conformity with the monumental representations of Christ in the cross of the time, namely: the Christ on the cross is in the suffering position; the body falling; the belly prominent on its perizonium; the head leaning forward touching the shoulder; the prominent ribs; the bloody wounds; the superimposed feet.The crucifix has small panels with scenes on the ends of the cross: the Virgin Mary on the left clothed in blue, St John on the right, hands clasped, and on top the titulus in red is surmounted by a blessing Christ accompanied by the Book. The background contains patterned gold behind the body of Christ.The cleaning and retouching of the blackened cross has revealed individual brush strokes and the bright colour of the lapis lazuli used by the artist. This expensive pigment now dominates the background of the work. Infrared photography and X-rays studies unearthed clear proof of the authorship of Giotto

40997-07wilton.jpg	This is the right panel of the Wilton Diptych (named after the house in which it was preserved), the finest work in England in the International Gothic style. Although it is a painting of extraordinary beauty and must be from the hand of an artist of the highest rank, critics disagree as to whether  he was English, French or Italian.St Edmund, king and martyr, St Edward the Confessor and St John the Baptist present the kneeling monarch Richard II of England in the left panel to the azure assembly of the Virgin and Child, attended by angels, on the right panel. The left scene is set in an earthly forest, the right in the flowering garden of heaven.The artist, who was probably one of the king's painters, has lavished more care on the delineation of the personal emblems and insignia of the king than on his actual personality. There was no need for the latter, since this donor image was meant for the eyes of the donor himself. The monarch wears around his neck the white hart badge which Richard adopted in 1390 as his personal insignia. It reappears on the reverse of the left panel. Both it and the French insignia of broom-cods (seed-pods) are woven into the king's iridescent gold mantle. The white hart badge is also worn by each of the eleven angels, who thus become royal retainers. One of them holds the banner of St George. The event commemorated here has been conjectured as Richard's coronation in 1377, his seeking divine sanction for a crusade in the mid-1990s, or his meeting with the French king in 1396.But need it refer to a specific historical moment? Surely it is an outstanding example of a private image, a portable diptych that would follow the king on his travels. Every time he knelt before it he would be transported among the timeless company of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the angels

17070-paris20.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 310, JH 1274.In the autumn of 1886 van Gogh met an Australian painter, John Russell, who had just spent the summer painting with Monet in Brittany. It was probably Russell who first explained Monet's work and the principles of Impressionist painting to van Gogh. In the following months he explored these novel insights and made the acquaintance of other artists of the Parisian vanguard.Yet when one examines this landscape, painted in the summer of 1887, these encounters seem to have had little impact. Admittedly the palette is different from those of the Drenthe and Nuenen periods, and the paint is applied in small strokes and not broad, undifferentiated bands. But in compositional structure the painting is typical of van Gogh's previous landscapes, especially of Drenthe. The viewpoint is low and intimate. The canvas is crudely divided into three horizontal bands, grass in the foreground, then the wheat, and, above rather than beyond, an expanse of blue sky which does not achieve any of the atmospheric or luminous subtlety of Impressionist painting. The sky is not the source of light, and thus the colour in the painting, however much it is richer and brighter in tone than before, does not represent the fall and diffusion of sunlight. Moreover each object, each blade of grass and stem of wheat, is carefully delineated. Forms are not dissolved into colour and light. The wheat field is not a mere 'appearance', but is almost physical in its tactility

06016-praise.jpg	"In a still-life from 1656 by Joseph de Bray (now in Dresden) a poem by the Remonstrant preacher and poet Jacob Westerbaen: 'In praise of the Pickled Herring' is prominently featured on a marble slab. The present painting, executed by the same artist in the following year, features the first lines of another poem by Westerbaen, ""Cupid's removal"" below the Pickled Herring verses. In this poem the author describes how Cupid disturbs a drunken brawl of the gods, whereupon they send him into exile. In Westerbaen's publication the two poems are not combined on one page, as de Bray suggests in his painting, but by combining them, the painter clearly and specifically emphasizes the herring's qualities as an aphrodisiac"

Those aspiring to be kings and rulers would vie for her endorsement to gain acceptance from among the people. Large parts of Greece fell to Philip of Macedon because Philip bribed the Python priestess to prophesy he would conquer.

04748-marriage.jpg	The subject marks the climax of the story of Cupid and Psyche as recounted by Apuleius in The Golden Ass (Books 4-6). The theme became popular with artists during the Renaissance and was also frequently depicted in the seventeenth century. The marriage of Cupid and Psyche took place in heaven on Mount Olympus after Psyche had endeavoured in vain to win back Cupid's love on earth by a series of ordeals set by Venus. The chief protagonists in this banquet of the gods are seated facing the viewer in the centre of the composition. Venus and Mars embrace with Vulcan to the left and Bacchus to the right. The immediate foreground is dominated by Neptune and Mercury, who conveyed Psyche to heaven in order for her to be reunited with Cupid. Jupiter and Juno are set further back in the picture space on the far right. Apollo, holding a lyre, can be faintly discerned top left, while Fame accompanied by putti blows a fanfare. The story of Cupid and Psyche was not always depicted simply as a narrative, but sometimes in broad philosophical terms as an allegory of carnal and spiritual love.The composition of the painting is inspired by a large engraving of the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche by Hendrik Goltzius, made after a drawing of 1587 by Bartholomeus Spranger. The rectangular format of the engraving was favoured by Bloemaert for another version of the subject now at Aschaffenburg, Bavaria. This compositional dependency on Spranger's work is echoed in the similarity of style, which in turn suggests an early date of about 1595 for the painting. Bloemaert here provides a perfect demonstration of Mannerism in the complicated twisting poses, the severe foreshortening, the restless movement, and the dramatic gesticulation. These stylistic tendencies are given an added visual complexity by the circular format that was also often used by Goltzius for his prints of mythological subjects.The painting formed part of a large group of pictures sold by the dealer William Frizell to Charles II in 1660. Of these, eleven were claimed by Frizell to have been in the collections of Rudolf II in Prague and Queen Christina of Sweden, including the present picture. However, no such painting seems to have been listed in the inventories of the collections of either of these famous patrons of the arts and so Frizell's claim remains unconfirmed.

07478-12magda.jpg	This picture and The Rest on the Flight into Egypt must have been painted around the same time, for the same girl sat for the Magdalene and the Madonna. On this occasion, however, there are none of the usual signs of a religious scene such as a halo. A young girl, seen from above, is seated on a low stool in one of Caravaggio's favourite cave-like settings, with a triangle of light high up on the wall behind her. Discarded jewellery - a string of pearls, clasps, a jar (perhaps holding precious ointment) - lies on the floor. The girl's hair is loose, as if it has just been washed. Her costume, consisting of a white-sleeved blouse, a yellow tunic and a flowery skirt, is rich. Bellori, who gives a careful description of this picture, which he came across in the collection of Prince Pamphilj, regards its title as an excuse; for him it is just a naturalistic portrayal of a pretty girl. This seems to show a willful failure to understand Caravaggio's intention or the wishes of the man who commissioned it, Monsignor Petrignani. The repentant Mary Magdalene, like the repentant Peter, was a favourite subject of Counter-Reformation art and poetry, which valued the visible expression of the state of contrition 'the gift of tears'. Caravaggio's heroine is sobbing silently to herself and a single tear falls down her cheek. She is, as it were, poised between her past life of luxury and the simple life she will embrace as one of Christ's most faithful followers. It is a sign of the painter's skill that he makes this inner conflict moving at the same time as he makes its representation delectable.Although nothing painted in the sixteenth century is as emotive as the statue in wood of the haggard saint carved by Donatello (c.1456-60), by the time Titian's bare-breasted Magdalene of the 1530s (Palazzo Pitti, Florence) had become the more modest and affecting Magdalene of the 1560s, there had been a move in religious sensibility towards the humble and pathetic, a change which thirty years later Caravaggio could take for granted

37525-2farnes.jpg	This fresco in the bedroom of Villa Farnesina was based on a Raphaelesque drawing that may have followed suggestions from Raphael himself.Chigi's bedchamber was adjacent to the banquet hall, and he had Sodoma decorate two of its wall, probably in conjunction with the decoration of the hall. The surfaces of the walls open up onto a narrative with large-scale figures, as if inviting visitors to enter. The main painting shows the wedding of Alexander the Great and Roxane. The composition is based on an ekphrasis (graphic description of a visual work of art). Lucian described a painting by the ancient master Aetion: Alexander handing the crown to Roxane in their wedding chamber. The princess is sitting on the bed, with Hephaistion and the god of marriage, Hymen, standing to the side; cupids are playing with the ruler's weapons and armor. Sodoma followed the description very precisely, he tried to recreate the ancient painting. However, the stage on which the figures are placed and their distribution in the composition follow a contemporary model: Raphael's frescoes in the Stanze, inspired above all by the Fire in the Borgo

37001-theford.jpg	Signed at bottom left: J. Siberechts en. anvers. 1672The painters of the Netherlands have always found in their own countryside an almost inexhaustible treasury of themes. Fertile fenland stretching into the distance, carefully maintained farmsteads, fords, meandering lanes with carts stuck in the mud, bluish waterfronts - these are the motifs repeatedly found in the works of Jan Siberechts, one of the most popular of the Flemish landscape painters. And these landscapes are peopled with figures closely associated with the toil of the land: a buxom country woman sits on a milking stool in front of a barn, a girl with her skirt tucked up drives a cart across a ford, a young herdsman rests while his flock grazes. In these contemplative paintings the mood is gentle; their appeal lies in the sparse arrangement of the motifs, the harmonious structure and bluish-grey colouring.In this picture, with its low horizon, light plays a very important role in connecting the foreground with the depths of the picture. It conveys movement and change and creates a feeling of harmony between man, beast and landscape

25151-anthony2.jpg	In 1940, several panels, until then universally attributed to Sassetta, were reassigned by Longhi to another hand, today generally known as the Master of the Osservanza (active c. 1430-50). The most striking are scenes from the Life of St Anthony which were commissioned by the Augustinians. They held Anthony (251&#151;356) in special esteem as the founder of Christian monasticism, whose example converted St Augustine (Confessions, Book VIII).In the second scene, St Anthony Distributing his Wealth to the Poor, Anthony returns home to his Sienese palazzo: seen first in profile as he comes downstairs, purse in hand, and then out in the street, still in his fur-lined crimson finery, but this time among the needy - the barefoot, the stooped, the widow in her patched gown, begging for her children. Two blind men are about to pass one another, one of them bravely led by a patch-marked, wire-haired smiling terrier. Although the staging of this contemporary street seems so simple, no previous artist had so tellingly choreographed the movement of passers-by, nor the engagement of a patrician with the common people.This typical Sienese palazzo, with its colonnetted Gothic windows and colour-washed facade in burnt sienna, is enlivened by constant invention: shutters, plants, metalwork sconces, interior glimpses. To compare this street scene with Duccio's Healing of the Blind Man is to recognize both a shift towards naturalism, and a real continuity

26136-36ursu06.jpg	6. Martyrdom in CologneScenes 5 and 6 form a continuous whole, and are enacted upon the eastern bank of the Rhine. The Roman rulers, who wished to snuff out this escalation in the practice of the Christian faith, called upon their relative Julius, leader of the Huns, to await the pilgrims in Cologne and to put them to death. The attack begins in the distance on the opposite bank, shown on the extreme left (the ship being fired upon is the one in the far right background of the previous panel). The massacre on board the two ships is depicted in the foreground. Etherius is stabbed to death in Ursula's arms.The king of the Huns, meanwhile, takes a fancy to Ursula, but when she fails to respond to his advances he shoots her dead with an arrow. It is difficult to identify the other characters depicted in this final panel. A woman and an older man standing behind Ursula witness her execution with intense sympathy. They are clearly citizens of Bruges, and unconnected with the legendary company. Perhaps they were involved in the ordering of the shrine. The turbaned figure is another odd presence. Memling, and other painters of his era, often portrayed Old Testament kings or Roman emperors in this manner. He might thus be one of the Roman potentates, unless he is the king of the Huns who makes known his feelings for Ursula with a gesture of his hand.The townscape features, from left to right, the Bayenturm, St Severin's, with the towers of St Maria Lyskirchen before it, St Maria im Kapitol, Gross St Martin and the Cathedral

04386-zmadonna.jpg	Many pictures have been attributed to Alonso Berruguete's Italian period and much has been claimed for them. These claims, which situate the artist in the vanguard of early Mannerism, are often supported by the questionable attribution of eccentric, unclassical paintings, which seem to lack true stylistic unity. One of the plausible candidates for his authorship is this tondo of the Madonna and Child with the Young St John, which both reflects and distorts the style of Michelangelo- The intimate embrace of the two figures and the ambiguous gesture of the Child, who places a finger in the side of his mouth, are characteristic of the unstable world of early Florentine Mannerism

32795-31doni1.jpg	This is the companion piece of the portrait of Maddalena Doni.The merchant Agnolo Doni married Maddalena Strozzi in 1503, but Raphael's portraits were probably executed in 1506, the period in which the painter studied the art of Leonardo most closely. The composition of the portraits resembles that of the Mona Lisa: the figures are presented in the same way in respect to the picture plane, and their hands, like those of the Mona Lisa, are placed on top of one another. But the low horizon of the landscape background permits a careful assessment of the human figure by providing a uniform light which defines surfaces and volumes. This relationship between landscape and figure presents a clear contrast to the striking settings of Leonardo, which communicate the threatening presence of nature.But the most notable characteristic that distinguishes these portraits from those of Leonardo is the overall sense of serenity which even the close attention to the materials of clothes and jewels (which draw one's attention to the couple's wealth) is unable to attenuate. Every element - even those of secondary importance - works together to create a precise balance.These works, linked not only by the kinship of the subjects, but also by their evident stylistic homogeneity, mark the beginning of Raphael's artistic maturity.The two portraits, which Vasari mentions, were originally in a hinged frame so that they could be opened and closed like a book. In a portrait diptych like this, a form very popular in the Renaissance, the man's portrait was usually on the left, the more important side heraldically

30483-resurrec.jpg	"In the latter half of the seventeenth century this painting was placed in the Chapel of Saint Ignatius, located in the area known as La Storta, 12 km outside Rome on the Via Cassia. The picture, probably born out of devotional motives, is a worthy example of the mature works of Passignano.It conforms to the pictorial requirements of the Counter-Reformation, which encouraged paintings designed to explain theology according to the dictates of Church teachings. Typical, for example, was the use of ""captions"" drawn from passages in the Bible. Passignano created two distinct zones in his canvas: below, there is the darkness of the sepulcher, with the guards asleep next to a nearly spent fire; above, a radiant and triumphant Christ encircled by angels."

38714-duet.jpg	"Engravings portraying young men playing lutes in the company of young women were created with various texts during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As part of a series depicting the five senses, such couples may have referred to Hearing; they may also have symbolized sanguine temperament, or, in some cases, ""earth"" from among the four elements, or the age of twenty. In each case, however, the common factors are youth, earthiness and full-bloodedness; these have been depicted since the Middle Ages, and all had to do with love: ""Learn to play the lute and the spinet, The strings can caress the heart!"" advised the poet Jacob Westerbaen (Gedichte II, The Hague, 1672). The lute often appeared on the cover illustration of hymnbooks as an erotic symbol, or as the attribute of Voluptas or Luxuria.It is thus very likely that the ornamental, double-stringed lute with its large rosette appears in Terbrugghen's painting to express a similar idea.In the painting of this Caravaggist artist from Utrecht the singing youths are characterized by exuberant gaiety, fully matured bodies and bright colours. The unusually colourful clothes, however, do not seem to be in accord with the fashions of the contemporary Dutch bourgeoisie. They resemble the dress of Burgundian actors from the previous century; thus they emphasize the ""Bohemian"" character of the two figures. The feathered beret, which was commonly used to indicate sensuality, bears special attention. The low-cut dress of the young woman is also a hint: an Amsterdam iconographic text from the sixteenth century prescribes a similar dress to express indecency. This must have been intended as a moralizing element in this otherwise rather tempting, happy scene, as these frivolous-looking paintings were always created with the aim of teaching a moral lesson."

34967-2mustai.jpg	The best preserved Carolingian fresco cycle can be found in a remote valley in Graub�nden, in the monastery church of M�stair. The church is dedicated to St John the Baptist, and it is generally believed to have been founded by in about 790, and probably by Charlemagne. One can assume that the frescoes were painted soon after the completion of the monastery church. Located in the apses, the paintings remained undiscovered until 1896 and were finally completely uncovered by 1950. Parts of the frescoes had been painted over in the twelfth century by artists belonging to the School of Salzburg.The artists who executed the paintings did not belong to Charlemagne's court school. Extensive commissions were taken on by itinerant artists who came from Italy and were trained in Byzantine style. The Byzantine influence can be found not only in the shapes but also in the treatment of the pictorial narrative, that is the manner in which the individual scenes are emphasized by the articulation of the architectural elements around them.The frescoes on the interior walls of the church date mostly from the early 9th century. At the top level are scenes from the live of David while most others are from the live of Christ. The west wall shows the Last Judgment

26558-02_3ce2.jpg	The eighth scene in the chronological order of the narrative, The Deluge, is depicted in the large field of the vault of the second bay, between the triangular spandrels.In the doctrine of the typological relationship between the Old and New Testaments, the Deluge was considered to prefigure baptism, while the Ark was the symbol for the Church itself. The lustral water of the baptism removes the original sin, while that of the flood cleansed the world of sinners. Noah was saved from the water by the wood of the Ark, just as the wood of the Cross offers salvation to those who are in the Church. Three different patterns of behaviour may be distinguished in human beings: while the righteous take refuge in the Ark (the Church) and find salvation therein, the damned attempt to assail it, and others are lost due to their excessive attachment to worldly things, and seek safety carrying their possessions with them.In fact, in the foreground of the fresco, the latter seek to flee from the threat of the rising waters by crowding onto the rocky islet on the right or by wearily climbing up to the high ground on the left. In the distance, the wicked, having reached the platform surrounding the Ark, hurl themselves against the vessel from which they have been excluded. Lastly, those who have reached a boat that is about to capsize, between the Ark and the hill in the foreground, are also engaged in a fierce struggle. The scenes of violence are countered by the behaviour of those who do not seek their salvation at the expense of others, but display compassion and a profound sense of solidarity toward the weakest individuals who have been overwhelmed by the same calamity.The large field, with the Deluge, is divided into several sections with some wonderful details, but these are not properly integrated. Their lack of coherence is partly justified in view of the elemental catastrophe but it offends the aesthetic sense, not to mention the fact that this Deluge seems to be a dry affair. One has to compensate by looking at the groups of figures reminiscent of antiquity yet full of new experiments and of movement; of naked human beings toiling, carrying or being borne away and resigned to their inevitable fates.The destructive forces of nature and the elements are hardly indicated. This lack, noticeable in many of Michelangelo's drawings is a logical one. He sees all passion and torment, all toil and victory in human terms; for him it is not the event itself which is decisive but its effect on those who experience it, expressed in movement and gestures. In their distress men may commit wrongs near the capsizing boat and round the ark, but the scenes of mutual assistance and mercy preponderate, and it is precisely this which raises the perplexing question: why should all these people perish? It is a great composition but one which still shows the influence of Signorelli and other painters; too involved, full of unsolved problems and over-crowded with detail. The unifying synthesis is yet to come

19999-7selfpor.jpg	"Holl�sy's ""Self-Portrait"" is one of the most upsetting pictures of Hungarian painting. The artist, who experienced a lot of disappointments and who is still optimistic, is examining himself. He portrays himself with great simplicity, with colours and forms vaguely defined, as an integrated part of his surroundings. A man approaching his final day, who has reconciled with his fate is looking into the eyes of the spectator to show what has become of his art. He is miles away from naturalistic details such as  the glitters of surfaces bathing in the sunshine or dust stirred up do not belong to his art: his portrait is the manifestation of realism"

She bore Joseph two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, who became the patriarchs of the Israelite tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim, respectively.Her story is elaborated in the apocryphal Joseph and Asenath. There, she is a virgin who rejects several worthy suitors in favour of Joseph, but Joseph will not have a pagan for a wife. She locks herself in a tower and rejects her idolatry in favour of Joseph's God Yahweh, and receives a visit from an angel who accepts her conversion. A ritual involving a honeycomb follows, and Joseph now consents to marry her.

43152-marcus_a.jpg	"Louis XV had Marigny commission a cycle of paintings on the virtues of great rulers. At the Salon of 1765 Vien presented this painting. Diderot commented it: ""The pose of Marcus Aurelius is not displeasing; it is simple and natural; but his face is without expression; it is truly unpained, without commiseration, steeped in all the apathy of his cult."" Diderot's conclusion was that the painting was a ""composition without warmth or liveliness, no poetry, no imagination.... they are just so many pieces of card cut out and placed one over another."

36320-cecilia.jpg	There is a long history of attributions of this painting to various artists. The attribution to Saraceni is accepted by the majority of art historians. However, the attribution to a non-Italian, Guy Fran�ois, has been sustained by all the French critics, notwithstanding the absence of any confirmed Roman works by this artist.If the painting is compared with certified works of Saraceni and with those of Guy Fran�ois (all executed after his return to Le Puy) it seems evident that neither of the two painters can be convincingly considered the author of this masterpiece. It is true nevertheless that one can identify in the execution of the painting some of the signature details shared by both artists, and some details peculiar to the style of one or the other. The most distinctive element of the picture, however, is the extraordinarily inventive composition, dominated by the enormous wings of the angel and by the diagonal of the bass viol. This instrument, along with the large lyre in the foreground, stretches across the entire surface of the canvas, as if to measure the space within. The courageous and original composition has no convincing analogues in the work of Fran�ois, which is always rather more conventional. On the other hand, this composition seems to fit well alongside proven works by Saraceni, beginning with the Flight into Egypt at the Eremo dei Camaldoli (1606).The depiction of the subject is related to the vigorous revival of the cult of Saint Cecilia in the first few decades of the seventeenth century, following the 1599 discovery of the virgin martyr's incorrupt body during the course of excavations at the Roman church of Santa Cecilia.In this painting the patron saint of musicians and musical instrument makers is a beautiful young woman, who appears surrounded by instruments in this interior created by green and red draperies. She is tuning her lute with a delicate movement, according to the instructions of an angel next to her. Her devoted attention indicates that her skill in the handling of instruments is derived from God. The painter depicted the spiritual meeting of the angel and Cecilia through a poetic mood and the inner brilliance of the soft profiles.The elegance of forms and gestures is coupled with gentle and natural realism. The dominant element, as it fills nearly one-third of the composition, is the six-stringed viola da gamba, which the angel holds in his right hand. The viewer is overwhelmed by the near-concrete realism of its shell, material and outline. Next to it on the ground lie two wind instruments; in the centre under the opened sheet music, a violin. The painter even included a small harp in the right background. On the other hand, the organ is missing; thus there is nothing to refer to the text of the St Cecilia legend.

32985-08carryx.jpg	The painting was executed for the Santa Maria dello Spasimo in Palermo, partly by the school of Raphael. (It is called Lo Spasimo di Sicilia.) The church was dedicated to the grief and agony ('spasimo') of the Virgin when she witnessed the sufferings of Christ, and the true subject of Raphael's altarpiece is indeed the mutual gaze of Christ, stumbling beneath the weight of the Cross, and his distraught mother, who reaches out her arms in vain.When the painting was being transported by sea to Sicily, it is supposed to have gone down with the ship, and to have drifted into the port of Genoa.

05654-diana_re.jpg	This painting is unquestionably Boucher's masterpiece. As a decorative artist, Boucher had amazing facility; in this painting, done for the Salon in 1742, he wished to excel himself. It places him in the ranks of the great masters, and on looking at it one begins to realize how gifted he was, even though he did not always make full use of his talent.The slender nudes and the hunting theme recall the School of Fontainebleau, of which certain traditions persist in the eighteenth century. The paint surface is intact, and the old varnish, which contains no artificial colouring, gives it a slightly golden tone.The painting is a masterpiece in the true classical manner; the technique is not too obvious, all the values are harmoniously balanced, and the elegance of the drawing and the purity of the forms are more important than the more sensual charms of colour.

16928-death_v.jpg	The major painting of Van der Goes's third period (between around 1478 and 1482) and very likely one of the last works he painted is the Death of the Virgin. The panel is almost square in shape. The scene is set in a totally enclosed room. The apostles are grouped around Mary's bed. The Virgin's fine blue robe contrast with the purple sheets that cover the bed. Her livid gray face is framed by the immaculate whiteness of her wimple, and of the cushion on which her head rests. Her hands are joined, her fingers look quite bony. Her eyes have lost their lustre. She looks up one last time towards the heavens, where her Son appears to her in His glory with arms outstretched, to display the wounds in his hands. He is dressed in a blue robe and a large red cloak held up by two angels. The picture represents the moment at which life has already gently slipped away, but death has not yet completed its work.The painter uses the apostles to ring the changes on the different varieties of grief, and their profound sadness contrasts with the detachment of the Virgin herself. Their clothes have been creased into countless shifting folds which cut across one another at right angles. Van der Goes is revealed as a penetrating analyst of religious feeling, of grief and devotion, and of the agitation they can cause. This work, like all those he painted during his last period, represents the eruption of sacred experience into a profane world. The artist achieves this through an abundant use of colours which strike the viewer as unreal, as if they were themselves transfigured. In this way, Van der Goes seeks to identify his painting with the mystery of transcendence itself.To this end too, the gestures of his figures are emphatic. He uses techniques or the progressive reduction of pictorial space and the transformation of figures, which he paints half-length, not full length

This was the first time that C�zanne had painted such a monumental canvas. Two other versions are in The Barnes Foundation, Merion, and in the National Gallery, London.The figures in all three compositions are remarkably simply and coarsely painted. The female creatures frolicking on the riverbank are not graceful, rather they are sturdy, angular, oddly proportioned and plump, and have nothing erotic about them.

20322-bouq_urn.jpg	The main line of eighteenth-century Dutch still-life painting is represented by the Amsterdamers Rachel Ruysch and Jan van Huysum, who both specialized in elaborate flower and fruit pictures. They were the most popular still-life painters of the period; their works commanded high prices and were found in famous collections throughout Europe, and their colourful paintings still have wide appeal. The status they were accorded in their time indicates there were powerful patrons and collectors who took exception to the teachings of academic theorists who minimized the significance of still-lifes by placing them at the lower end of the hierarchy of kinds of painting.In the hands of Rachel Ruysch and Jan van Huysum Dutch flower pieces brighten up again. Their technical perfection and love of minute detail recall the still-lifes painted a century earlier by Bosschaert and his followers, and like their predecessors they did not hesitate to include flowers of different seasons in their arrangements. However, neither Ruysch nor van Huysum arranges blooms into evenly lit symmetrical bunches in the way that early-seventeenth-century painters did, and their lively chiaroscuro effects and delightful ornateness show an unmistakable affinity with Late Baroque and Rococo art.

He stands apart from his colleagues in resisting the general predilection for dark settings with the light coming from a single or one principal source. The transparency of his colors and the brightness of his tones are combined with a very individual sense of space in which something of the late sixteenth century goes hand in hand with a love of realistic detail typical of the new age. Three of Maino's works that claim attention are the Adoration of the Shepherds and its companion-piece, the Adoration of the Kings (in the Prado) as well as the Pentecost in the Toledo Museum

42589-16ladyv.jpg	"Signature: Signed along the lower edge of the frame of the painting on the extreme right: IV Meer [IVM in monogram]. Inscribed on the underside of the lid of the virginals: MVSICA LETITIAE CO/ME/S/MEDICINA DOLOR/IS/ [Music is a companion in pleasure, a remedy in sorrow]Provenance: The provenance of this painting is rather uncertain in its early stages. It may have been part of the collection Diego Duarte in Antwerp, 1682. Then in the Amsterdam sale of 1696, no. 6: ""A young lady playing the clavecin in a room, with a listening gentleman; by the same; fl 80."" Afterward, possibly in another Amsterdam sale, 1714. However, the description alludes only to a ""woman playing the clavecin in a room,"" without mentioning the listening gentleman. Hence, doubt. Joseph Smith, English consul in Venice, bought in 1741 a number of Dutch paintings from the widow of the painter Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741). One was described in Pellegrini's inventory as A Lady at the Spinet - without mention of the gentleman. When Smith sold his collection to King George III, it contained a painting attributed to Frans van Mieris: A Woman Playing on a Spinnet in presence of a Man seems to be her father. The Mieris is certainly our Cat. No. 13, but whether we have here the painting formerly owned by Pellegrini remains questionable. From the collection of George III to the English royal collection.The greatness of Vermeer is dependent upon the economy of his style and the precision of his technique, which served to create an enigmatic mood that has become the hallmark of his mature paintings. The apparent simplicity of the compositions, which to a large extent rely on a limited number of studio props, and a restricted number of settings, belie artifice.There is general agreement that A Lady at the Virginals dates from the 166Os, but it is difficult to be more exact. The subject prompts comparison with Vermeer's Concert Trio in Boston (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum), but the bolder, more dramatic use of perspective, emphasising the longitudinal axis of the room, is closer to paintings of the late 166Os such as Lady writing a Letter with her Maid (Beit Art Collection, Blessington, Ireland), The Love Letter (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum) and The Geographer, dated 1669 (Frankfurt, St&#228;delsches Kunstinstitut). This treatment of perspective is typical of the style developed by painters working in Delft during the 1650s.The relationship between music and love as a theme was frequently explored by Dutch seventeenth-century painters with varying shades of meaning. Vermeer's subject matter is often understated, but at the same time objects contained within the picture reinforce the meaning, which in some instances is interpreted on a quasi-philosophical basis. Thus, the two instruments - the virginals and the bass viol - here signify the possibility of a duet symbolising the emotions of the two figures.Similarly, the painting behind the man can be identified as Cymon and Pero (also known as Roman Charity) in which a daughter feeds her father, who has been imprisoned, from her own breast, a theme that clearly has connotations that are open to interpretation in the context of love. Cymon and Pero is in the style of a Dutch follower of Caravaggio (possibly Utrecht school), although the original has not been identified. Interestingly, a painting of this subject is listed in the 1641 inventory of items belonging to the artist's mother-in-law, Maria Thins.The keyboard instrument has been identified as being comparable with those built by Andries Ruckers the Elder. Examples with identical decorative devices on the lid, keywell and fallboard, as well as similar inscriptions, are in Bruges (Museum Gruuthuse), Brussels (Mus�e Instrumental du Conservatoire) and Amsterdam (Rijksmuseum). The lining paper on the keywell, decorated with flowers, foliage and sea-horses, also occurs on instruments depicted by Metsu (A Man and a Woman seated by a Virginal) and Steen (A Young Woman playing a Harpsichord), both in the National Gallery, London. There are specific sources for the patterns used on the lid and the fallboard, but no source for the pattern on the keywell has yet been discovered.The mirror above the woman reflects not only her head and shoulders, but also the artist's easel. The fact that there is a diminution in scale of the head in the mirror and that the image itself is slightly out of focus denotes the use of a camera obscura. However, while the box visible behind the easel in the reflection may indeed be a camera obscura, it may also be a paintbox.The mood of this interior by Vermeer is created as much from the confrontation of the two figures as from the juxtaposition of mundane objects within a space precisely proportioned and subtly lit"

06909-merrycom.jpg	In the late 1610s Willem Buytewech began to paint scenes of fancily attired youth drinking, making music, and courting. In this characteristic work a brightly coloured group of four men and two women fully occupies a shallow interior, pressing on us their enjoyment of music, wine, and those notorious aphrodisiacs, oysters. But rather than communicating an obvious narrative, the figures are posed in attitudes of merriment, swagger, and romance.This company originally alluded more blatantly to illicit pleasure, as the man at left held a chamber pot, a fixture of brothel scenes. The offensive item was painted out early in the twentieth century, when the man's hand was repainted as resting on the chair.

18368-1603grec.jpg	On 18 June 1603 El Greco signed a contract to make and decorate an altarpiece for a miraculous image of the Virgin of Charity belonging to the Hospital de la Caridad in the small town of Illescas halfway between Toledo and Madrid. According to the contract the main altarpiece and the decoration of the vault were to contain four canvases: The Madonna of Charity, The Coronation of the Virgin, The Annunciation and The Nativity. This project was executed in collaboration with the artist's son, Jorge Manual Theotokopoulos. Under a separate contract a further painting, St Ildefonso was made.Although El Greco treated the subject of the nativity several times, this is his only version depicting the Holy Family without other human participants. In the shadows to the left, an ass contemplates the scene. In the foreground the foreshortened head of an ox, his horn echoing the curve of the circular format, looks up from below.Presently the painting is in the vestry of the church.

22287-1foscar1.jpg	The interior of the foresteria is divided into a large main room, flanked by other spaces, the guest rooms. Frescoes cover the entire wall surface of the main room, executed by Domenico Bruni and Pietro Liberi.The dimensions of the main room seem greatly expanded by the extraordinary theatrical effect of the illusionistic architecture, which creates the impression of a vast courtyard, open to the sky and surrounded on four sides by monumental loggias. The trompe l'oeil decoration is the work of Domenico Bruni, who signed and dated his undertaking in Latin letters placed on plaques that are painted and inserted into the frieze of the first stringcourse.Figural compositions are for the most part secondary to the architectural layout, and the only place figures appear, besides the ceiling, is along the two short walls where there are depictions of The Temple of the Arts and Mars Accompanied by Learning, Truth, and Eloquence. These paintings are attributed to Pietro Liberi

43991-0bladel.jpg	In the middle of the 17th century this triptych, known as the Middelburg Altarpiece, was in the Flemish city of Middelburg, founded by the rich Bruges burgher Pieter Bladelin and his wife around 1444. The donor of the work, also known as the Bladelin Altarpiece, is therefore usually thought to have been the founder of the city himself. On the other hand, Middelburg passed into other hands after the death of the Bladelins, who had no children, and there is no evidence that the altarpiece did not arrive there at a later date. Furthermore, it shows only one donor, although Bladelin's wife was cofounder with him of the new city. The donor depicted, wearing the same fashions as the Duke of Burgundy and obviously a member of the upper classes, must therefore be considered unidentified.In the centre panel the donor is shown kneeling in an attitude of prayer beside the Virgin and Joseph, adoring the naked Child. In the background is a town, perhaps representing Middelburg, near Bruges. The stable of Bethlehem resembles the ruin of a Romanesque chapel. The painter may have had in mind the remains of the palace of King David, who was reckoned among the forbears of Jesus. In the foreground the building is supported by a single pillar which bulks so large beside the tiny figure of the Child that it must obviously be regarded as symbolic. It can be interpreted both as a symbol of sublime power and of the place where Christ was later scourged.The message of the centre panel alone would be incomplete without the scenes portrayed on the two wings. The three panels together are an allegory of the world dominion of Christ and show not only the ruler of Middelburg and Brabant but also kings in both west and east paying homage to the Child. Tradition has it that, on the day of Christ's birth, a prophetess, the Sibyl of Tibur, showed the Emperor Augustus a vision of the Child and his Mother in the heavens. Here the ruler of the West (the Duke of Burgundy) falls humbly on his knees, removes his crown and swings a censer as a token of sacrifice. In the right-hand wing the three kings of the Orient are depicted; deeply moved and fearful, also kneeling before the vision in the heavens; this is the star of Bethlehem, which appears in the clouds with the embodiment of the Child, to guide them on their journey.Not only in terms of the subject matter but also in the formal composition of the work, the painter has related the side-wings to the central scene. In so doing, he abandoned the uncoordinated scheme of the multipartite altarpiece familiar throughout the Middle Ages. One need only compare earlier works by Rogier van der Weyden such as the tripartite Altarpiece of Saint John the Baptist - to realize the extent of his advance. The bold use of space which the painter makes in each individual scene of the Saint John triptych becomes even more marked in the Bladelin Altarpiece, where the compass of the picture extends over all three panels, and this is also reflected in the abandonment of any dividing architectonic framework.Rogier was one of the first great painters of the north to visit Italy. Around 1449/50 he must have been in Ferrara, Florence and Rome; and it would have been soon after his return from the south that he received Peter Bladelin's commission. There are few indications of Italian influence in the Middelburg Altarpiece. It is perhaps to be traced in the left wing, where the attendants, standing stern-faced and silent at the picture's edge, recall Quattrocento portraits in Florence.Peter Bladelin (d. 1472), Treasurer to the Duke of Burgundy and founder of Middelburg, donated the altar triptych to the town church. It has been replaced by an early copy; the Berlin Gallery bought the original panels in 1834 from Nieuwenhuis in Brussels, who had previously purchased them in Middelburg

11311-413delac.jpg	This painting decorates the ceiling of the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre.Delacroix's greatest virtuosity was reserved for a  project which came in 1850, between the decoration of the Senate and Palais Bourbon libraries and the monumental Salon de la Paix at the Hotel de Ville, and was the most important commission of Delacroix's life. It was nothing less than the decoration of the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre. Following a fire, Le Vau had reconstructed this historical gallery for Louis XIV, while the decoration was entrusted to Charles Le Brun. Then in 1678, Louis left Paris for Versailles, and work ceased. In 1793, in the wake of the French Revolution, the Louvre became a museum, and the Second Republic deemed the completion of the decoration a republican duty.Le Brun had intended a subject dear to the heart of the Sun King: Apollo on his chariot. For Delacroix, to make his mark at the very heart of the Louvre and to do so not by exhibiting paintings but by decorating the central part of a ceiling was a thrilling opportunity. Before he began, he felt the need to study the works of Rubens in Belgium.In his Apollo Slays Python, Delacroix retained Le Brun's ambition to portray the mythological figure of Apollo in the gallery of that name. But Delacroix enhanced Le Brun's allegory with a further allegory close to his own heart: intelligence wrestling with barbarity and light struggling with darkness. By emphasising the contrast between the two parts of his composition, the world of the sun above and that of darkness beneath, Delacroix transformed Le Brun's project and raised it to the plane of an eternal symbol.The subject, which Delacroix took from Ovid's Metamorphoses, is effectively the victory of Good over Evil. But it takes the form of beauty vanquishing the ugly and genius dispelling stupidity

23149-perugino.jpg	This splendid portrait - at the Uffizi since 1704 - has been much discussed, as the painter and the figure have been mysterious for a long time: it once was thought to be Martin Luther painted by Holbein, then Andrea del Verrocchio by Lorenzo di Credi, or again a portrait of unknown man. The comparison with the Pietro Perugino's self-portrait painted in the Collegio del Cambio at Perugia led to the identification as Pietro Perugino, and the attribution went to his most celebrated pupil, Raphael. Recently the attribution to Lorenzo di Credi was again proposed.Both the identity of the sitter and the authorship of the painting are still matters of debate. The attribution to Raphael is supported by the majority of contemporary scholars.In the painting, particularly noticeable is the influence of North European portrait-painting, in the realistic rendering of the face, in the characterization of the man, but above all in the insertion of the figure in the narrow confines of an interior, with a small window offering the partial view of a distant landscape

00341-st_peter.jpg	In this work, as often occurs in the painting of Allori, the composition is slightly over-emphatic. Saint Peter, kneeling in the foreground, enveloped in his billowing garments, seems in fact to be acting on a stage. The setting, instead, is made pleasant and gracious thanks to an almost archaic use of perspective, to that sea rising high on the horizon, ruffled by light foaming waves, and to the small boat, tossed by the waters, brimming with small figures.

25231-3garam.jpg	"The picture shows one of the panels of the Garamszentbenedek Altarpiece.In contrast to the external panels of the altarpiece, which all represent scenes taking place out of doors, a rhomboid-patterned golden surface provides the background to the Passion scenes depicted on the internal wings. These panels are chiefly connected with the courtly art of Burgundy and with the entourage of the Duc de Berry.In the lower field of the right-hand panel Christ, in front of a crowd of furious soldiers, carries the cross on his shoulder to Golgotha. The Virgin and a holy woman follow him, while the end of the cross is supported by Simon of Cyrene, depicted on a smaller scale. Christ's words are to be ead on the inscribed scroll: ""Daughters of Jerusalem weep not over me, but weep for yourselves and for our children."" The long beam of the cross is placed along the principal diagonal line of the picture and the halo of Christ covers the point of intersection of the beams. The striking veins of the wood give a particular emphasis to the huge cross. Thomas de Coloswar may have been attracted by this task, engrossing him to such an extent that he forgot about connecting the annual rings on the different sides of the cross.Despite the brutal countenances and the coarse gestures of the soldiers the basic tone of the scene is not dramatic. Christ's face is expressing sadness rather than suffering, nor is the Virgin tortured by the agony of the moment; she is rather submerged into more profound sorrow, surprassing the actual event. The process, mentioned in the introduction, can be observed in this picture in the course of its development; a process in which the artist picks out certain motifs from the narrative of events , and transforms and displays them for the purpose of private devotion. The thick cross seems to push back the soldiers figures and even the figure pulling Christ by a rope round His waist is ousted from the foreground. The giant figure of Christ becomes rigid as if it were a character in a tableau vivant: He stops in His course, addressing the holy women. And yet, this is not a really epic scene either: turning to the spectator He looks into space, and the inscribed scroll, whose semicircular part touches the Virgin s mantle, tells the spectator His words to the women. The scroll separates and, at the same time, points to the figure of Christ, almost putting Him into a frame. By this it makes the hand of the soldier in red, who strikes Him with a stick, symbolic. There is only one single step to leaving out the mercenaries' figures - and the devotional picture is complete for the purpose of private worship. The same tendency is shown by the mode in which the Virgin's figure is depicted. Her face does not reflect the shattering effect of the events which are taking place, but rather presents a state of inward reflection and of meditation"

08573-1variou3.jpg	C�zanne developed a completely new way of depicting objects in space. He reinvented still-lifes on the basis of their two-dimensionality, and used purely artistic means to give them depth. He used dual viewpoint to show objects from two different viewpoints. He avoided linear perspective in his depictions of objects, he could paint them so that their size was in proportion o to their importance in the composition as a whole.C�zanne set up all his still-lifes in his studio. Some of the objects he used are still in his last studio on the Chemin des Lauves in Aix. Apart from the fruit, many of the objects, such as jugs, pots and plates, frequently recur in his compositions.

34472-mother2.jpg	"The icon with the motif ""Mother of God of the Passion"" was extraordinarily popular in the Cretan icon-painting of the late 15th and the 16th century, and is venerated both by Orthodox and by Catholic Christians.This type takes its name ""Mother of God of the Passion"" from the fact that the Christ-child, sitting on the left arm of His mother, is turning towards the Archangel Gabriel, who is depicted floating in from the right holding out a Cross. From the other side the Archangel Michael approaches, holding further symbols of the Passion, the Spear and the Holy Sponge.Possibly the ""invention"" or at least the popularisation of this icon type is due to the important painter Andreas Ritzos. Three signed Madonnas of the Passion by him are known. The painting style of these signed icons corresponds so closely to that of the Mother of God of the Passion in Recklinghausen as to allow an attribution of the latter to Andreas Ritzos too. In all the icons, a striking feature is the perfect technical execution, and the smooth surfaces of the flesh depiction, which are modelled by a large number of delicate, parallel white brush-strokes"

15155-01quarat.jpg	The central panel of the Quaratesi altarpiece shows the Virgin and Child. This panel is flanked by four saints each on a separate gabled panel (now in the Uffizi, Florence). Christ with his foreshortened halo leans out of the little roundel in the gable above the Virgin. All elements were further harmonised through subtle adjustments of composition and colour. Gentile's sumptuous decorative effects can now best be appreciated in the gold brocade, for the once-brilliant cloth of honour behind the Virgin and Child, painted translucent red over silver leaf and green over gold, has darkened and blotched with age.Despite its regal magnificence, the central group retains a graceful intimacy. The Virgin, an ideal beauty of her day with fair hair, broad forehead and rosebud mouth, looks out gravely as the Christ Child smiles contentedly, showing his tiny milk teeth. Keeping firm hold of his mother's cloak, he turns from her to the adoring angel, with a daisy - symbol of his innocence, picked in Heaven, the garden of eternal spring - held daintily between his pudgy finger and thumb

04508-portrait.jpg	The unidentified sitter - no more than fifteen or sixteen years old - stands before an extensive landscape and stares at the spectator with self-confidence. The view of the walled city of Florence in the middle ground at left indicates that he was Florentine.Formerly the painting was attributed to Botticelli, only in the 1930s it was recognized as a work by Biagio d'Antonio, a prolific Florentine painter, a contemporary of Botticelli. Biagio was one of the team of artists including Botticelli, Cosimo Rosselli, Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio, and Luca Signorelli who decorated the side walls of the Sistine Chapel in 1481-82.Biagio's talent for portraiture is evident in the animated faces he painted in the Sistine Chapel. The present painting is one of the three surviving autonomous portraits by Biagio, all of them bust-length portrayals of young men standing before landscape background. The portrait in the Metropolitan Museum is the earliest, reflecting Verrocchio's sculptural style, it probably dates from about 1470

28479-tobias.jpg	An artist who owed much to Pieter Bruegel the Elder was Joos de Momper, one of the landscape painters preceding the generation of Rubens who made a real contribution to the development of that genre. Although he had also made the usual journey to Italy, it was the example of Bruegel that he followed in his many rocky landscapes, and his vision that was reflected in the vast scale of the composition and the interpretation of perspective in distant views. He usually left the staffage to be painted in by fellow artists specialising in figure painting, as in his Tobias' Journey.The story is recounted in the Book of Tobit. Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight

09024-02ermini.jpg	Princess Erminia was a character in the epic poem La Gerusalemme liberata by Torquato Tasso. In this tale she falls in love with the Christian knight Tancred, and betrays her people to aid him. Once she discovers that Tancred is in love with Clorinde, however, she returns to join the Muslims. She subsequently steals Clorinde's armor then joins a group of shepherds.In his paintings Claude creates a loose space, almost always leading the eye to infinity at some point, and often with a wide line of horizon. This space is filled with atmosphere which penetrates the trees standing in it and forms the continuum of the picture. Recession is established often without the use of linear perspective, by the subtle degradation of colour, usually in objects such as trees which have no sharp outline. Moreover, these objects may be disposed on a horizontal plane, as are, for instance, the trees covering the valley in the Erminia, in which the eye is led from the river to the extreme distance simply by the change in colour of the groves

09705-10gangel.jpg	The picture was kept in the museum at Viterbo with an attribution to Romanelli until the Second World War. Documentable as an autograph work of Cortona's, the painting was commissioned directly from the painter by Pope Alexander VII in 1656, along with a pendant of St Michael the Archangel. The painter presented the two pendant pictures to Alexander VII when the pope named him to a papal knighthood. The pope returned the favour by presenting Cortona with a gold chain.The work has had a good critical fortune, and was copied by both Gaulli and Maratta. A drawing of the subject by the former is conserved in Berlin, while a print is also known to have been cut after the painting.

17772-502goya1.jpg	Though it was no doubt painted earlier, the first record of The Clothed Maja and the first mention of the paintings together is in an inventory of Godoy's collection dated 1 January 1808, where they are called 'gipsies'. In an article on Los Caprichos published in Cadiz in 1811, it is as Goya's Venuses that they are mentioned amongst his most admired works (they are also called Venuses in Goya's biography by his son). The next mention of the Majas is towards the end of 1814, when Goya was denounced to the Inquisition for being the author of two obscene paintings in the sequestrated collection of the Chief Minister Godoy, 'one representing a naked woman on a bed...and the other a woman dressed as a maja on a bed'. On 16 May 1815, the artist was summoned to appear before a Tribunal 'to identify them and to declare if they are his works, for what reason he painted them, by whom they were commissioned and what were his intentions'. Unfortunately Goya's declaration has not yet come to light.As a pair of paintings of a single figure in an identical pose, the Majas are a highly original invention. The theory that the clothed woman was intended as a cover for the naked one is very credible. It is not surprising that the Majas attracted the attention of the Inquisition in Madrid in 1814. As late as 1865 Manet's Olympia (which bears such a close resemblance to The Naked Maja that it is difficult to believe that the artist had not seen Goya's painting) created a furious scandal when it was exhibited in the Paris Salon

37909-lovesick.jpg	"Amongst the genre scenes that brought Steen popularity and fame, there are almost twenty showing a doctor's visit to a bourgois home. As theatrical as any Commedia dell'arte play, they present scenes full of misunderstandings, secrets, assumptions and indiscretions. The ""illnesses"" of the patients are generally unforeseen pregnancy or lovesickness. The bed with the painting of lovers hanging over it, and the statue of Amor on the draughtscreen of the door immediately indicate to the spectator what is going on. The basin of coals in the foreground with the burning thread - quack doctors diagnosed pregnancy by ""reading"" the smoke - and the maid with her suitor at the door are further typical features of this genre. The patient, whose pulse the doctor is counting, has a note in her hand on which the following words are written: ""Daar baat gen/medesyn/want het is/minepeyn"" (""No medicine can cure the pain of love"").Though hardly a profound insight, these words constitute a moral of the kind that is almost invariably to be found behind these types of Dutch paintings. For all the autonomy of the subject matter, a painting without such a ""deeper"" meaning would have been inconceivable at the time, and indeed did not actually emerge until the 19th century"

05647-armida.jpg	The subject was inspired by the 16th-century epic poem 'Gerusalemme Liberata' (Jerusalem Delivered) by Torquato Tasso (1544-95). Rinaldo and Armida are a pair of lovers in the poem which is an idealized account of the first Crusade which ended with the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 and the establishment of a Christian kingdom. Armida, a beautiful virgin witch, had been sent by Satan (whose aid the Saracens had enlisted0 to bring about the Crusaders' undoing by sorcery. She sought revenge on the Christian prince Rinaldo after he had rescued his companions whom she had changed into monsters. The pastoral story of hate turned of love, of the lovers' dalliance in Armida's magic kingdom, and Rinaldo's final desertion of her, forms a sequence of themes that were widely popular with Italian and French artists in the 17th and 18th centuries.The artist was admitted to the Academy by presenting this painting.

03305-predell2.jpg	In 1485 Domenico Ghirlandaio received the commission for the Adoration of the Magi for the main altar in the church of the Spedale degli Innocenti. The prior of the church, Tesori, also commissioned the predella with stories of the Virgin and the great cornice of the altarpiece. The latter had been executed by the carpenter Francesco Bartolo on designs by Giuliano da Sangallo, while the scenes of the predella are the work of one of Ghirlandaio's pupils, Bartolomeo di Giovanni; this is confirmed by the records and the workmanship of the fine, slender figures which are characteristic of him.The predella, with the Martyrdom of St John the Evangelist, the Annunciation, the Marriage of the Virgin, the Deposition, the Presentation in the Temple, the Baptism of Christ, the Consecration of the Church of the Innocenti, had been dismembered at the time of the restoration of the great altar (1615). In the 19th century the seven panels were in the Sala delle Adunanze. Later they were reunited with the painting, which was now devoid of Sangallo's fine cornice that was destroyed in the restoration of 1786.The picture shows one of the seven predella paintings

33542-63portra.jpg	"Catalogue number: Bredius 218.Around 1640 Rembrandt painted a number of portraits of distinguished, withdrawn figures, all bathed in subdued light. These include Nicolaas van Bambeeck, a relatively well-off wool merchant from Amsterdam and of his wife Agatha Bas. She was the daughter of Dirck Jacobsz. Bas, several times burgomaster of Amsterdam from 1610 onwards. In other words, the two spouses came from somewhat different social backgrounds. The sublime matching portrait of the magnificently dressed, innocent-looking young woman belongs to the collection of Queen Elisabeth II of England.The two portraits were conceived as a unity in every way. A strong, formal bond was created between the two through the repeating of a broad trompe-l'oeil ebony moulding, forming bays from where the standing models lean slightly forwards and which was probably picked up by the moulding of the frames in which the two portraits were originally mounted. Through the artistic trick of having fingers and attributes run over the edge of the trompe-l'oeil moulding, the artist causes the fictional space of the figures to subtly flow over into the viewer's real space. Nicolaas van Bambeeck's pose, itself inspired by Titian's Portrait of Ariosto, was frequently imitated by Rembrandt's contemporaries in other portraits.The spouses' characteristics are revealed largely by a number of oppositions in their body poses, in the sign language of their hands, in their facial expressions and in highly significant details such as crushed gloves versus an open fan, their respective attributes. What we have here is a subtle play of thesis and antithesis, which can obviously only be recognised as such when both portraits ""dialogue"" directly with each other.The two canvases went their separate ways as early as 1814, and the full effect of one portrait on another can today be demonstrated only by placing photographic reproductions together. But even before the paintings were separated, both underwent treatment that drastically changed their appearance: for an unknown reason they were considerably trimmed back on all four side, thereby losing most of the trompe-l'oeil effect. There are certain paintings that one can never again look at with an open mind, once one has tried to reconstruct them in one's imagination as they originally looked"

40242-rovere_8.jpg	The Roverella Polyptych is considered as one of Tura's most important work. Originally it was located in the church of San Giorgio fuori le Mura in Ferrara where it was partially destroyed by a bomb in 1709. It was commissioned by Lorenzo Roverella, bishop of Ferrara.According to the most accepted version of reconstruction the Madonna Enthroned constituted the central panel, this fragment showing St George belonged to the left panel, while on the right a panel representing Niccol&#242; Roverella with two saints was located. On top of the altarpiece there was a Piet&#224;.

03834-132portr.jpg	From the 1470s, and simultaneously with his intense sacred output, Bellini had been engaged in work as a portraitist (in fact the Portrait of J�rg Fugger, the first known dated work by Bellini, is of 1474); although not particularly prolific, this activity was highly significant in terms of its results. The influence of Antonello da Messina in this field was highly evident in some instances. The Portrait of a Young Man in Red of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, datable to between 1485 and 1490, is one of the clearest examples of this, even though the psychological rapport between the person portrayed and the spectator is less immediate than in Antonello da Messina.Although the concept and design of this portrait, considered to be among the finest of late quattrocento portraits extant, are derived from a Flemish prototype, the monumental simplicity of design, impersonal mood, and generalized surfaces betray the classical traditions of Italy

18728-guard108.jpg	The motif of the slender, graceful bridge spanning a narrow lagoon was repeated by Francesco Guardi in several of his works. In one of his drawings in the Correr Collection in Venice the arrangement and details correspond almost precisely to this picture. In Guardi's vedute the buildings and the topography of the town play a relatively small role. The painter seems to have been mainly interested in the pictorial message he intended to convey, in the general impression created by the hues resolved in light, the vibrating patches of colour, and in the total effect of the multicoloured figures. It is this free and easy, almost detached, manner of representation which renders his works so modern.The painting belongs to a series of four landscapes, all in the Budapest Museum

Buckingham was extremely unpopular, and the failure of his aggressive, erratic foreign policy increased the tensions that eventually exploded in the Civil War between the Royalists and the Parliamentarians.Buckingham, a connoisseur, had bought Rubens's collection of ancient sculpture, gems, and coins.

05676-i_letter.jpg	This painting is also referred to as The Two Confidantes, The Messenger, The Lovers' Secret Mail. It typifies the pastoral idiom Boucher had already made his own by the late 1740s. He never concerned himself with the verities of country life, but employed the shepherdess type as an idealized protagonist for his decorative pictures. In this example he lavished his brush on the women's satin dresses, their powdery skin, and the casual perfection at their hair.The painting is the pendant to the Interrupted Sleep (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), another pastoral subject matching in size, composition and amorous theme. The paintings were produced for Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, marquise de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV. They were described as overdoors for Pompadour's residence at Bellevue outside Paris

36821-port_man.jpg	Sebastiano Luciani was born in Venice, where he worked as the pupil and follower of Giovanni Bellini and later of Giorgione. After 1511 he moved to Rome, where he came under the influence of Raphael and Michelangelo, who were working there at that time, and he gradually abandoned the soft, picturesque Venetian style of his early work to become one of the most important representatives of the School of Rome. He was frequently commissioned to paint portraits of the Roman nobility. In 1531 he was given the sinecure of Piombatore Papale (keeper of the Papal seals) and thereafter called himself Sebastiano del Piombo.When Portrait of a Man was bought for the Museum in 1895, it was generally believed to be a portrait of the poet Antonio Tebaldeo by Raphael; in the Ducal Gallery of Modena, too, it had been attributed to Raphael. But at the beginning of the twentieth century it was decided that this picture and several other paintings of the same type, also attributed to Raphael, were in fact the work of Sebastiano - the main reason for the decision being the Venetian character of the landscape background. The posture and clothes of the sitter indicate that the portrait was painted in Rome between 1515 and 1520

12519-2adorat.jpg	The elector Frederick the Wise of Saxony ordered this painting for the Schlosskirche (the church in the castle) in Wittenberg. It was once believed to be the central part of a polyptych, with, on the side wings, the story of Job, in Frankfurt and Cologne. However, this hypothesis has already been called into question. The elector of Saxony then donated the painting to Emperor Rudolph II in 1603. An exchange with the Presentation at the Temple by Fra Bartolomeo brought it in 1793 from the gallery in Vienna to the Uffizi.This altarpiece was probably conceived without the lateral panels, in contrast with the actual practice in Nordic countries, and at variance with the situation of the Paumgartner altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich). D�rer framed and delimited a large space by an architecture composed of arches of a very refined perspective. The three kings arrived at this slightly elevated space from the back and after having climbed two steps. A single figure, sharply foreshortened, followed in their footsteps from the distant background. Only the upper half of his body is shown where he now stands at the bottom of the two steps. He is Oriental and wearing a turban. The heavy traveling bag he holds probably contains precious gifts for the infant Jesus.The Madonna is clad in azure clothes and cape, a white veil covering her head. She is holding out the infant, who is wrapped in her white veil, to the eldest king. He is offering the infant a gold casket with the image of Saint George, which the infant has already taken with his right hand. This is the only action that unfolds in the principal scene, except for the Oriental servant's gesture of putting his hand in his bag. All the other characters are motionless; immersed in thought, they look straight ahead or sideways, creating the effect of a staged spectacle set with immobile characters.The architecture of the fictive ruins behind the Madonna is beautiful and imaginative. D�rer had previously experimented with this design in drawings and engravings. The background is stupendous: the limpid sky, in which the cumulus clouds chase one another; the light Nordic city, climbing up the cone-like mountain; the road bending into the archway where people stop, following behind the three kings. These are represented with much imagination and variety, as far as the fashion and colour of their clothes and the differences in their expressions. In the far right are a lake and a boat.This imagination and variety continue in the extraordinary depiction of the kings, in lavish clothing, with their precious jewels, and with the beautiful goblets and caskets that they bear as gifts. It is telling here that D�rer was also an expert goldsmith. According to the Nordic tradition, also adopted previously by Mantegna in Italy, one of the kings is a Moor. The physiognomy of the young king with long blond curly hair, standing in the middle of the painting, bears, according to recent interpretation, a resemblance to a self-portrait of D�rer.D�rer was passionately devoted to the study of animals and plants, which he reproduced faithfully from life. He often distributed these images in his landscape passages, and particularly in his drawings and engravings of the Madonna. We find some here as well: in the foreground, to the right, a flying deer, already known from various watercolours, which here symbolizes Christ; the plantain (plantago major) seen directly behind, whose healing properties were once much appreciated, recalls the spilled blood of Christ; in the foreground, now to the left, on the millstone beside the carnation, a small coleopterum surrounded by a few butterflies, the ancient symbol of the soul, which here may be a symbol of the resurrection.The panel of the Uffizi represents the richest and most mature actualisation of all D�rer's altarpieces, before his second trip to Italy, and therefore before the Feast of the Rose Garlands, painted in Venice (N�rodn� Galerie, Prague)

39705-07anadyo.jpg	"The word ""Anadyomene"", which means ""one who has surfaced"", is a reference to the birth of Venus.

This scenes are located on the wall opposite to the window wall of the chancel. They are from the seven scenes depicting events from the lives of the two founder saints.The miracle scene depicts the healing of the son of a Byzantine officer who was possessed by a demon. The exorcising saint, assisted by a kneeling brother, dips his finger into an oil lamp suspended in front of an image of the Madonna, aware that the drop of oil will drive out the demon. Raphael's altarpiece of the Transfiguration, the lower part of which shows the apostles healing a moonstruck boy, served as a pattern for the possessed boy.The burial scene represents the transfer of the saint's corpse from the monastery of St Agatha, where Nilus had died, to Grottaferrata. The unusual view of the saint lying on his bier, in extreme foreshortening and with naked feet, quite clearly resembles Caravaggio's altarpiece The Death of the Virgin, whose installation in Rome in 1606 had caused a scandal

03065-dianaact.jpg	The story with Diana and Actaeon was a favourite with the late Mannerist painters. This is understandable, because the myth, particularly in Ovid's playful, witty and lively presentation, contains both stimulatingly erotic and shivering horror story elements and thus was perfectly suited for the contemporary spirit. In Balen's painting Diana's figure is placed in the centre in a regal position. Over the head of the virgin goddess, Cupid is holding a crown of flowers. The action is developed in depth and the light falling on the women bathing in the clearing in the background indicates that the scene is located in a shadowy wood.

19700-vase1.jpg	Tom�s Hiepes lived and worked in Valencia, where he enjoyed considerable local fame as a still-life and flower painter. This painting, the magnificent floral arrangements Vase of Flowers, reflects his ability in flower painting. The format and style of Hiepes's flower paintings appears to have changed little throughout his career, he painted flowers with the same painstaking technique, love of symmetrical order and idiosyncratic charm that distinguished many of his still-lifes.Hiepes's flower pieces are reminiscent of earlier Flemish works in terms of the number and variety of ornamental flowers depicted. This painting with sunflower includes no less than twenty-six species, far more than any other Spanish flower piece in the period. Hiepes also differed from other flower painters in Spain in the accuracy of his depiction of flowers, including the relative size of different blooms.The floral arrangements depicted in Hiepes's work, however, are unlikely to have been copied from real bouquets before the artist. It would have proved impossible to bring together in one place and at one time all of the flowers depicted in the paintings, since these bloom at different times of the year and most flowers would have wilted before the painting was finished. Moreover, it would appear to be an impossibility for so many large flowers to fit into the narrow neck of the vase. Hiepes must have painted each bloom individually into his flower piece, probably from single flowers or from other graphic sources. The degree of separateness between these in his paintings appears to betray this practice.The images on the Italian vase depict scenes of a classical triumph. Similar images decorate the vases in other flower pieces by Hiepes. Three gilt figures of crouching nude slaves are trampled underfoot by the Roman emperor and appear to support on their backs the whole arrangement of flowers. The decorative splendour of the vase certainly makes it a suitable recipient for such a magnificent display of flowers.

29247-101muril.jpg	This painting was painted at the beginning of Murillo's career. It is without doubt one of the first of the genre scenes in which he shows street urchins. Later his taste for the picturesque sometimes became merely anecdotal, but here the sincerity of his observation and the vigour of his technique place Murillo in the pure tradition of the Spanish 'tenebrismo' of the young Vel�zquez and of Zurbar�n.

19864-3warham.jpg	William Warham (1450-1532) was the last of the pre-Reformation archbishops of Canterbury, a quiet, retiring intellectual who nonetheless closed his career with a resolute stand against the anticlerical policies of King Henry VIII of England. Lord Chancellor from 1504 to 1515, William Warham was the man who crowned the young royal couple Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon (1485-1536) in 1509. He remained faithful to the Roman Catholic Church all his life and when, after 1529, Parliament took more and more steps to restrict the authority of the Pope during the conflict over the King's divorce, the archbishop protested. Nonetheless, he died a natural death at a ripe old age in 1532, and unlike many others, like St Thomas Becket, the earlier archbishop whom he revered, did not have to pay with his life for his fidelity to the Catholic Church.Whereas in The Solothurn Madonna the gold settings of the precious stones adorning the miter of St Nicholas are simulated with yellow paint, in this portrait of Warham, Holbein used real gold applied with a brush for rendering William Warham's episcopal miter. This is typical of his works in the period after his journey to France

10974-200david.jpg	David owed his rise to fame - after many reversals - to a painting for the execution of which he took his family to Rome, in order to absorb himself totally in the world of antique forms. It was The Oath of the Horatii.When he arrived to Rome, David rent a studio in the Via del Babuino. He worked in a very methodical manner on The Oath of the Horatii, drawing from life models and draped mannequins, and some very detailed studies survive for many of the main figures. He had accessories such as the swords and helmets made by local craftsmen so that they could serve as props. Drouais is supposed to have assisted David, painting the arm of the rear Horatii brother and the yellow garment of Sabina. The painting was finished at the end of July 1785, and was then exhibited in David's studio. David signed the painting and added the painting's place of origin to the signature and date: L David / faciebat / Romanae /Anno MDCCLXXXIV. The painting created a sensation, even the Pope wanted to view it.The story is from the 7th century B.C., and it tells of the triplet sons of Publius Horatius, who decided the struggle between Rome and Albalonga. One survived, but he killed his own sister because she wept for one of the fallen foes, to whom she was betrothed. Condemned to death for the murder of a sibling, Horatius' son is pardoned by the will of the people.Because of its austerity and depiction of dutiful patriotism, The Oath of the Horatii is often considered to be the clearest expression of Neoclassicism in painting. The painting's uncompromising directness, economy and tension made it instantly memorable and full of visual impact. Each of the three elements of the picture - the sons, the father and the women - is framed by a section of a Doric arcade, and the figures are located in a narrow stage-like space. David split the picture between the masculine resolve of the father and brothers and the slumped resignation of the women.. The focal point of the work is occupied by the swords that old Horatius is about to distribute to his sons. While the rear two brothers take the oath with their left hands, the foremost one swears with his right. Perhaps David did this simply as a way of grouping the figures together, but people at the time noticed this detail, and some supposed that this meant that the brother in the front would be the one to survive the combat

30594-hannibal.jpg	The story depicted in this painting is related by Livy in The War with Hannibal: The History of Rome from its Foundations. After bringing the African War to a close, Hamilcar, commander of Carthage during their defeat to Rome in the First Punic War, was offering sacrifices before transporting his army to Spain, the boy Hannibal, nine years old, was coaxing his father to take him with him, and his father led him up to the altar and made him swear with his hand laid on the victim that as soon as he possibly could he would show himself the enemy of Rome.  This is the scene which Pellegrini has depicted, and he has opted to almost fill the composition with his figures, which focuses attention to the emotional relationship between father and son. A notable feature of the painting, showing the influence of Sebastiano Ricci and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, is the rich and vivid colouring used by Pellegrini.

20783-miraculo.jpg	In Jouvenet's later work the Baroque tendency is marked. His most important series of canvases consisted of the four colossal pictures of the Miraculous Draught of Fishes, The Resurrection of Lazarus, Christ Driving the Traders out of the Temple, and Christ in the House of Simon, painted for St Martin des Champs and put in place in 1706. Most writers attribute the Baroque quality of Jouvenet's later style to the influence of Rubens.In one respect, Jouvenet differs from most of his French rivals in religious painting. There is in his work a strong element of naturalism. In the Miraculous Draughty for instance, the piles of dead fish in the foreground are given a prominence and are treated with a relish which would have shocked the Academy in Le Brun's time; and we are told that, in order to paint the picture, Jouvenet made a special journey to Dieppe to study similar scenes on the spot. The same naturalism is to be seen in Jouvenet's choice of types for this picture, in which the apostles are the coarse fishermen which a Caravaggesque might have selected

22417-3portrai.jpg	L�onard Limosin, who first worked for Fran�ois I in 1545, was named a member of the royal household under Henri II, during whose reign he was at great demand at the court, receiving commissions for the royal chapels as well as for portraits of important dignitaries.This large oval likeness of Anne de Montmorency is especially impressive. Limosin had so mastered his craft that his enamels have the precision and lightness of oil portraits. Anne, First Duke of Montmorency (1493-1567), was a French soldier, diplomat and constable of France. Named for his godmother, Queen Anne of Brittany, he served three kings - Francis I, Henry II, and Charles IX - in war and peace. He was sixty-three when he sat for this image; while his face is wrinkled, his eyes are bright and piercing. Set into the gilt-wood frame, with its strapwork and foliage inspired by the art of Fontainebleau, are enamel copper plaques bearing ornamental motifs and emblems, notably the constable's device

37489-boarhunt.jpg	Frans Snyders, Rockox's friend and neighbour and a witness to his last will and testament, was the leading still-life and animal painter of his time. His fruitful career was linked in close symbiosis with the artistic world of Rubens, with whom he frequently collaborated. Both the paintings Snyders made alone and those he produced in collaboration with Rubens are so intimately bound up with Rubens' ideas and language of form that they have to be appreciated in this context. Just as in Rubens' work, Snyders assembles the elements of his paintings not only on the basis of their artistic characteristics, but also as elements with a part to play in the overall design and decorative effect of the canvas as a whole.The monumental work Wild Boar Hunt gives a striking portrayal of the tragic lot of both the victim and the hounds who have cornered him.

It was painted to go over a door in the courtyard of the Procuratie, Venice. The damage from exposure to the elements is still visible; Tintoretto himself restored it in 1590, when it was moved to the inside of Scamozzo's new building. It has been at the Brera since 1808.Tintoretto achieved the highly oratorical effect of this work by the studied compression of the attendant figures bending over the body of the dead Christ.

13808-dogezian.jpg	In this canvas on the wall of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio Fiammingo appears to be adapting himself willingly to the uniformity of Tintoretto's influence, from whose formulas he was able, like many others, to extract those elements which almost automatically amplified the rhetorical discourse to be depicted. The responsibility for maintaining a homogeneous idiom on the walls of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio went to Tintoretto, not only on account of the numerous painting with which his workshop was entrusted, but also, indirectly, because he established himself as an example to be followed			
14967-tahiti13.jpg	When Gauguin included this painting in the exhibition he mounted at Durand-Ruel's gallery back in Paris in 1893, its price of 1500 francs was higher than that of any other work included in the show, demonstrating the importance he attached to it. Because of its exoticism it was a work that was guaranteed to appeal to a Parisian audience, and Gauguin's careful inscription of the title onto the painting points to his control of his audience. The question seems to be posed by the woman in the background, of her companion whose desire to find a husband is suggested by the flower she is wearing behind her ear. That it should deal with the ritual surrounding Tahitian marriage was a clear attempt to appeal to an audience who would have recognized the subject of the eminently popular Marriage of Loti, which Gauguin had read and which helped shape contemporary Western perceptions about the languorous Tahitian women

His huge Last Day of Pompeii was finished in 1833, a year before Lord Lytton published his famous novel on the same theme. That Pompeii was obliterated by a natural catastrophe, suggestive of divine retribution, only added to its significance

30053-2father1.jpg	The picture shows the internal panels of the Altarpiece of the Doctors of the Church: Sts Augustine and Gregory on the central panel, Sts Jerome and Ambrose on the side panels.The Altarpiece of the Church Fathers was created in 1483 for the Neustift Monastery near Brixen. With it Pacher reached a point at which the borders between painting and sculpture in the north were no longer clearly distinct, the altarpiece translates the subject of a carved shrine into panel painting. It thereby follows on from Rogier van der Weyden's Deposition from the Cross (Prado, Madrid), but goes far beyond the earlier painting in its optical missing of the two genres.The altarpiece is a depiction of the four great Fathers of the Church. On the far left, Jerome is portrayed as a cardinal with the lion from whose paw he drew the thorn. Next comes Augustine, accompanied by a child in a reference to one of the legends surrounding his life: one day by walking by the sea sunk in thought, the saint came across a child scooping up water with a spoon. In reply to his enquiry as to the sense of his activity, the child replied that it was just as pointless as Augustine's own attempts to understand the holy essence of the Trinity with his rational mind. Third comes Pope Gregory the Great, who is seen delivering Emperor Trajan from Purgatory, and finally, on the right, the archbishop Ambrose, busy writing. The dove of Holy Ghost appears beside all four saints as a symbol of their divine inspiration.The foreshortened floor tiles combine with the apparently projecting baldachins to confuse the eye, as real and pictorial space seem to overlap, The virtuosity of the foreshortening is not matched by the modelling of the figures, however, who acquire their volume primarily from the suggestive power of the vaulted canopy above them

38709-bravo.jpg	The artist worked mainly in Utrecht, but spent about ten years in Rome from about 1604-1614 where, like several other Dutch painters, he became versed in the style and subject matter of Caravaggio and his followers. Ter Brugghen was, in fact, the first of the Dutch artists to return to the north where, together with Baburen and Honthorst, he helped to establish the tenebrist style. Although no doubt based on one of the itinerant musicians who travelled in the Netherlands at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the subject is most probably an allegory of the senses of Hearing (the bass viol) and Taste (the glass). It is also possible that the artist is illustrating the theme of vanitas whereby the brevity of song is equated with a short life-span. A number of paintings in ter Brugghen's oeuvre explore such subjects, but only one other (known through a copy) includes a bass viol. On the other hand, the model, the vividly coloured costume and the cap are standard studio properties used by the artist during the 1620s. Benedict Nicolson noted the forced smile of the sitter, comparing it to 'that thrown by the politician to his constituents' in 'a joyless wish to please'. The breadth of the handling of the paint contrasts with the drawing which is most fastidious. An important element, however, is the treatment of the light, which in its emotive power is decidedly Caravaggesque, but in its descriptive qualities anticipates later seventeenth-century Dutch painting.The painting is signed upper left: HTBrugghen fecit 1625 [HTB in monogram]. Purchased by Charles I and sold after his execution, the picture was in the possession of Sir Peter Lely at the time of the Restoration and was returned to the Royal Collection.  It was cleaned in 1989.

18136-crypt_sm.jpg	Among the first of a number of artists to take a pictorial interest in Roman ritual, rather than in the traditional Christian iconography, was the young Proven�al Granet, who while studying in Rome began painting church interiors with officiating clergy. This new genre anticipated the medievalism of his Troubadour compatriots and found a ready market. His haunting Crypt of San Martino ai Monti, a view of the vaults which were once part of the ancient Baths of Trajan, includes a female corpse in its white shroud, while a hooded priest and his acolyte prepare for the committal.

34286-bacchus.jpg	It was Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete, who helped Theseus, whom she loved, to escape from the labyrinth with the aid of a ball of string, but all she had in return was to be abandoned by him on the island of Naxos. Here Bacchus came to her rescue. Classical representations show Ariadne asleep when Bacchus arrives, as described by Philostratus. But according to Ovid she was at that moment lamenting her fate, and Renaissance and later artists  generally depict her awake. Bacchus took her jeweled crown and flung it into the heavens where it became a constellation. Ariadne was readily consoled by him and they were married shortly afterwards

34274-venus_ad.jpg	The story of Venus and Adonis, which has attracted not only artists but poets, including Shakespeare, tells that Adonis was the offspring of the incestuous union of King Cinyras of Paphos, in Cyprus, with his daughter Myrrha. His beauty was a byword. Venus conceived a helpless passion for him as a result of a chance graze she received from Cupid's arrow (Met. 10:524-559). One day while out hunting Adonis was slain by a wild boar, an accident Venus had always dreaded (Met. 10:708-739). Hearing his dying groans as she flew overhead in her chariot, she came down to aid him but was too late. In the place where the earth was stained with Adonis' blood, anemones sprouted. Artists usually depict two scenes, the depart and the death of Adonis. This painting represents the first scene.Adonis, spear in hand and with hunting dogs straining at the leash, is impatient to be off, while Venus imploringly tries to hold him back.

07197-canal313.jpg	This painting belongs to a group of seven views from the harbour side of Venice, all of them in the neighbourhood of the Molo or of the Punta della Dogana at the mouth of the Grand Canal. Nothing is known about the individual responsible for commissioning the series. All of the compositions are adaptations of somewhat older and more ambitious works. However, there is a strong stylistic unity.At the end of the 1720s there was a demand for Canaletto's topographical work on the part of prosperous English tourists. In response to this situation Canaletto's work  underwent great changes. The size of his paintings decreased, making them easier to ship. However, the atmosphere also changed. Well-bred tourists wanted to have a reminder of Venice not as a stage decoration with ghost-like shadows and sultry skies, but as the ideal Mediterranean city. They admired attractive, beautiful and above all recognizable buildings, harmoniously arranged and painted in soft colours under a bright blue sky with the merest hint of a white cloud.Between 1727 and 1730 Canaletto became a master at this new genre, one he was largely responsible for creating. He no longer prepared the canvases with a reddish-brown but with a beige or a light grey ground. The paint was further diluted and more smoothly applied, with only a couple of perfectly measured, thickly applied strokes for clouds and figures. With the help of his assistants, Canaletto produced hundreds of paintings of this type, often in pairs, sometimes in series of twenty or more. Although the quality of the routine production slowly but surely declined in the course of the 1730s, Canaletto nevertheless also painted a number of works of very high quality in these years. The present painting is a good example of this kind of work made for the new tourist market.This view is taken near San Biagio, looking toward the west along the Riva degli Schiavoni. From right to left we see the corner of the present-day Museo Storico Navale, a building on the corner of the Rio dell'Arsenale that has since been demolished, a warehouse, the campanili of San Giovanni in Bragora and San Giorgio dei Greci, the Molo with the Ducal Palace and the Campanile of San Marco and, behind the masts, Santa Maria della Salute. On the far left a small point of the island San Giorgio Maggiore can just be discerned. The Bacino di San Marco is filled with a variety of boats, including two with a lateen sail and a three-master. The lines directed toward the vanishing point of the footpath on the right invite the spectator to cross the bridge together with the pedestrians and to walk further along the quay. Thus the eye is led toward the horizon and back over the boats to the foreground

39644-2baptist.jpg	Even more than in his Presentation of the Virgin at the Temple, Titian's attempt to fill out his chromatic language with Mannerist elements is clearly evident in this work painted for the now demolished church of Santa Maria Maggiore. The overpowering plasticity of the figure, its theatrical pose, and the strength of the timbres of the tones all reflect the dominant taste of the fifth decade of the sixteenth century in a Venice which was increasingly concerned with the problems of form and composition that preoccupied the 'classicists' of Central Italy, ideas that were propagated in Venice by Jacopo Sansovino, Vasari and Salviati.But even in this muscular athlete (certainly no hermit emaciated by exhausting fast) the formal academic quality of Mannerism is redeemed by Titian's sensitivity to colour: the 'impasto' of the paint seems almost to be rising in the luminous matching of the grey of the skin to the ivory colour of the flesh and in the browns, greens and darkened by the rushing torrent. Indeed it was precisely because of his feeling for colour that in Titian the formulae of Mannerism, instead of crystallizing in abstract programmatic projects, was translated into an enthusiasm for research

15603-spedale.jpg	"Vasari writes about the painting: ""In the church of the Innocenti he painted in tempera a much-admired picture of the Magi, containing some fine heads and varied physiognomies of people both young and old, notably a head of the Virgin, displaying all the modesty, beauty and grace which art can impart to the Mother of God"".There are so many saints in this Adoration that it is not easy to make out the three Magi. On the left, Saint John the Baptist is kneeling and pointing to the Madonna. The orphans of the Spedale are represented by two of the innocent boys who were killed during the Slaughter of the Innocents in Bethlehem, kneeling in the foreground. There are gaping bloody wounds to their faces, arms and necks.In this Adoration of the Magi, Ghirlandaio's carefully thought out use of colour is particularly impressive: Ghirlandaio distributes the glowing colours evenly. Mary in the centre is wearing a blue cloak over a red dress. The oldest king kneeling in front of her is wearing a variation of these colours combined with yellow. To the left of Mary, the youngest king holding the valuable goblet in his hand - he almost looks like Saint John the Evangelist - is also dressed in blue, yellow and red. The figure standing on the right edge of the picture wearing an expensive hat repeats this combination of colours, though now the blue and yellow are reversed. In the second figure from the right, wearing the blue hat, the Madonna's colours of red and blue are visible again, and they are repeated in clothes of the bearded man wearing a turban on the left edge of the picture. Between the Madonna and the man with the blue hat on the right, the artist creates a yellow highlight, though with a weaker blue accent, in the figure of Joseph. This row of figures alone produces a rhythm of colour from left to right: red and blue; yellow, blue and red; red and blue; yellow and blue; red and blue; yellow, blue and red.The work represents one of Ghirlandaio's most important ""easel"" works. Here too the assistants were at work. Indeed, in the scene of the Slaughter of the Innocents in the background, Berenson recognized the hand of Bartolomeo di Giovanni, the author of the stories from the predella"

39664-03salvad.jpg	Withdrawing into a noble creative isolation in which he explored new forms of expression, Titian painted a series of works on sacred and secular subjects for the court of Spain and other clients. The Annunciation in the Church of San Salvador near the Rialto is Titian's key religious painting of the 1560s. It is one of Titian's boldest and most freely painted late works. Here the warm, rich colour blurs the outlines of the figures and turns the painting into a shimmering iridescent haze.The traditionally acquiescent pose of the Virgin, with arms crossed as she receives the message, has been transferred to the angel since Titian has here chosen to depict the moment just after the actual Annunciation itself. The Virgin, having lifted her veil to receive the Word, remains in suspended animation as she absorbs it, while the angel stands in awestruck reverence at the implications of the news just imparted and at the mystery of the incarnation. There is a materiality about this painting that belies its otherworldliness. Gabriel's wings are the reverse of feathery and have the surface density of beaten brass, yet the viewer is seduced into believing that the wings of angels could exist in no other form.The composition derives from a lost Annunciation that Titian painted in 1537 for the nuns of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Murano. The nuns rejected it as too expensive, so Titian promptly presented it to Charles V hoping to encourage further commissions

40865-09cross.jpg	In the early part of the fifteenth century, a school of painting arose in Tournai independently of the Van Eycks, whose spectacular new style seems to have flourished in a family context. The new school achieved a highly developed anatomical and physiognomic representation of the human figure. Robert Campin was the central figure in Tournai, heading a studio there between around 1415 and 1432. Despite its innovations, a number of often archaic procedures continued to be applied in this environment, including golden grounds, starry skies and an exaggerated perspective (steep floors). These elements are clearly visible in an important anonymous work, Christ on the Cross with Mary as Intercessor and a Donor. It was evidently produced in the Tournai sphere of influence in around 1420-30 or perhaps even earlier

34345-mo_tasso.jpg	Torquato Tasso (1544-1595) was once wildly popular, quoted by philosophers, emulated by poets, and a source of inspiration to painters and composers. Even his sad and tormented life was an obsession for the romantics, inspiring a play by Goethe, a poem by Byron, a painting by Delacroix and a symphonic study by Liszt.He suffered from mental instability throughout his career, obsessing over his poems. It was a favourite subject for the romantics - the artist, a victim of his own prolific imagination, hounded into insanity. Michel Eyquem de Montaigne (1533-1592), the sober, 16th-century philosopher, apparently met Tasso in an asylum near Ferrara in 1581, according to a fascinating passage from one of his essays.

26045-13nodo.jpg	A native of Germany, Hans Memling became the leading painter in Bruges. Many pictures from his large workshop were exported to Italy, where his mode of painting landscape backgrounds, with hazy distant hills and individual leaves highlighted on the trees, influenced, among others, Perugino. Just such a background can be seen in this small altarpiece painted for the Welsh nobleman and courtier Sir John Donne, who is shown kneeling to the Virgin's right in the centre panel. The Christ Child on her lap is blessing him, and his two name saints, John the Baptist, holding a very realistic Lamb of God, and John the Evangelist, are pictured on the shutters. In the somewhat less honorific position at the Virgin's left kneel his wife Elizabeth and their oldest child, Anne. The two female saints are Catherine, presenting Sir John to the Virgin, and Barbara behind Lady Donne. Catherine's identifying wheel and Barbara's tower wittily appear as realistic incidents in the distant landscape behind them - the former as a millwheel in the water, with the miller loading a sack of flour on his donkey nearby. Angels play music and amuse the Child, who is crumpling the pages of his mother's book, by offering fruit - motifs often used in paintings from the Memling shop. The mode is at once homely and grand, in keeping with the architecture, part Netherlandish domestic and part-Italianate palatial, and simultaneously pious and sunny.Sir John and Lady Donne are shown wearing Yorkist collars of gilt roses and suns from which hangs the Lion of March pendant of King Edward IV. The altarpiece may have been commissioned when Sir John was in Bruges in 1468 for the marriage of Margaret of York, Edward's sister, to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, or possibly on a later trip to nearby Ghent.The reverses of the shutters depict St Christopher and St Anthony Abbot painted in tones of grey to resemble stone statues

In the still Italian air, Chateaubriand's hair is windswept (Napoleon mischievously said the portrait looked like that of a conspirator who had come down a chimney), hinting at the storms and passions that had lashed his best-known creation.

25152-anthony3.jpg	In 1940, several panels, until then universally attributed to Sassetta, were reassigned by Longhi to another hand, today generally known as the Master of the Osservanza (active c. 1430-50). The most striking are scenes from the Life of St Anthony which were commissioned by the Augustinians. They held Anthony (251&#151;356) in special esteem as the founder of Christian monasticism, whose example converted St Augustine (Confessions, Book VIII).In the final episode, it is revealed in vision to the ninety-year-old Anthony that an even older hermit exists - 'one more excellent than thou art'. He sets out to find him, his passage through the landscape charted in the final panel. At top left, mantle slung over his shoulder, he comes into sight along the path, which then vanishes behind a mountain, emerging again from the trees on the right. At the next turn, Anthony, wearing his mantle, asks directions from a centaur who seems to be a kind of guardian of the forest. The path plunges on into a wood, whose foliage is patterned in small clusters of dotted marks, until, at last, it arrives at the mouth of a cave, where Anthony is lost in the embrace of St Paul the Hermit, their overlapping haloes a kind of consummation. The two old men (whose heavily veined hands and feet receive special emphasis) have cast down their yellow staffs at the moment of meeting.This panel was rediscovered in 1931 by the British art historian, Ellis Waterhouse, in a bathroom in Piccadilly

43592-9peace.jpg	"The attribution of this painting is debated, the painter could be a student of Vouet's workshop in Rome. The closeness between the Vouet Magdalene (in the same museum) and the figure in the foreground of this allegory is strong enough to make it probable that the execution of these two figures was done by the same hand, or at the very least by the same workshop. It could be connected with both Simon Vouet, or alternately to the anonymous ""Brother of Cavalier Muti"" who vanished from the Roman scene immediately after the return of Vouet to France.The subject, clearly celebrating the Barberini family, may well have been suggested by Francesco Bracciolini, the mind behind the iconographic program of the great Divine Providence vault cycle that Pietro da Cortona frescoed in the Palazzo Barberini"

He is surrounded by the detritus of his profession: books and papers, cryptic substances, bottles, strangely shaped jars, and chipped earthenware abound. Bega has depicted these items with astonishing fidelity. Every chink, imperfection, and reflection in the implements scattered about the room has been deftly captured.

30265-sibyl.jpg	The painting is a fine example of a type frequently found in the work of Giorgione and Titian, by whom Palma Vecchio was influenced. The sensuality of the image is reinforced by the use of shallow diagonals to place the figure in the composition, by the colours (light green, cream white and straw yellow), and also by the subtle play of light. The scale of the figure is somewhat smaller than in the artists related works, and the drapery less fulsomely handled. These restraints suggest that the picture dates from around 1520, preceding such paintings as the Flora (London, National Gallery). Although many of these works have specific subjects such as Lucretia or Judith, or are allegorical, it is often the case that they are disguised portraits of Venetian beauties of the day. This conceit was continued, for example, by Sir Peter Lely in the series of ten portraits known as the Windsor Beauties in the Royal Collection, and it flourished again in the nineteenth century with Rossetti and Burne-Jones. The subject of the present painting is apparent from the inscription in pseudo-Arabic on the cloth in the lower left corner

28401-denying.jpg	Molenaer was a Dutch painter active in his native Haarlem and Amsterdam. In 1636 he married Judith Leyster; both belonged in their youth to the circle of Frans Hals. He and his wife probably collaborated and sometimes it is difficult to differentiate their work. Molenaer specialized in genre scenes, but his range was wide, from pictures of the crude, indecorous activities of peasants to small, exquisitely finished domestic scenes of well-to-do families. He also did portraits and religious scenes. His early works (which are considered his best) have a grey-blond tonalitiy and touches of bright colour, but his later ones are darker, in the manner of Brouwer and Ostade.It is hardly recognizable that this genre painting depicts a Biblical scene; it is happening in a Dutch tavern filled with peasants and soldiers. However, this is a dramatic and colourful representation of a theme taken from the gospel. The detail is well observed. We are made to feel Peter's alarmed wish to escape and the scornful superiority of the servant-girl; we see the braggart, the sly informer and the soldiers, drunk and indifferent. It is as if the figures were characters in a biblical play produced to give the episode the tragicomic casualness of everyday life. The style of the painting approaches so near to the developing tradition of contemporary genre that the religious theme is not immediately apparent.This picture exemplifies the moment in the development of the vigorous style of Dutch painting during the late sixteen-twenties and early sixteen-thirties when religious painting came closest to genre; from then onwards the two styles developed in ways that were mutually exclusive. Later, Rembrandt alone was to resolve the contradiction between the two styles, but his contemporaries, including Molenaer, all abandoned the attempt.The painting is signed on the right side, on the back of the chair: M MOLENAER 1636.

26389-2maria_t.jpg	Martin van Meytens as a court painter had the permanent task of painting the portraits of the Emperor and the Queen, as well as of the various members of the imperial family. Since the decoration of various residences and institutes, gifts to foreign sovereigns, aristocrats and diplomats and various festive occasions made necessary several copies of the imperial portraits, these courtly representations were made in series by the workshop, and Meytens himself played only a minor or greater part in their execution. He had no occasion to make more than a study of a head after the model the Queen had neither the time nor patience to sit for the artist for a long time. This original head  or bust sketch was copied with different poses, clothes and accessories for the different imperial portraits. The portrait of Maria Theresia exhibited here is very similar to her figure in the great family portrait made in 1754 (Vienna, Sch�nbrunn). Her pose, hairstyle, neckline, the piece of jewelry worn at the collar and the gesture of her right hand are all identical. The study which served for both pictures as a model, was copied several more times by Meytens and his workshop

23691-1adorati.jpg	"The Adoration of the Shepherds and its companion-piece, the Adoration of the Kings were painted as altarpieces for the Convent of St Peter Martyr in Toledo. Maino comes close to what we now term 'superrealism' in some sections of the pictures. He achieved this effect by careful control of the texture, shape and volume of the objects together with a very cold but bright lighting, which reveals the influence of Caravaggio and the Italian Baroque.The Adoration of the Shepherds is the work of a painter fully immersed in the art of Caravaggio. Maino appropriated not only Caravaggio's distinctive human types, seen especially in the angels and the shepherd in the right corner, but also his characteristic use of light and his love of intricate, studied compositions. Furthermore, Maino was able to fathom Caravaggio's dazzling surface effects and comprehend his profoundly human sense of religious feeling. In the most moving passage of the painting, St Joseph kneels beside the Christ Child and tenderly, almost reverently, kisses his wrist, subtly fusing feelings of paternal love and spiritual revelation. In this work, Maino reproduces the flamboyance of Caravaggio's early Roman style, exaggerating it by heightening the luster and brilliant colour of the exotic costumes, an effect that he possibly appropriated from the Dutch and Flemish ""Caravaggisti"", who were in Rome at the same time.Some aspects of the compositions derive from El Greco, whose works were so numerous in Toledo"

03835-101giob.jpg	This painting (Madonna with the Child, Saints and Angels) was executed for the church of San Giobbe in Venice, originally over the second altar on the right of the church, completing, in an illusory way, with its own spatiality, the Lombardian architectural plan. When it appeared, it immediately became one of Bellini's most celebrated works. The datation is uncertain, however, it is assumed that this was the first altarpiece by Bellini painted with the new oil technique introduced by Antonello da Messina in Venice in 1475-76.The altarpiece is one of the cornerstones of the artist's mature years. A coffered vault is a perspective introduction to the composition, which is supported at the sides by pillars similar to the real sculpted ones of the altar. The pillars flank a deep niche, which with its shady penumbra amplifies the space behind the holy group. Bellini conceived the painting as a coherent prolungation of the real space.In it, the figures are arranged with monumentality and human warmth; the modelling is softened by the redefined blending of colours, which reflects dim crepuscular lights from the apsidial basin, depicted like a gold mosaic according to a visual and chromatic tradition associated with the basilical mosaics of San Marco

In works such as this Portrait of a MAn in the Louvre, he recorded his sitters faithfully and well. It is easy to see Champaigne as a painter who epitomized French art at the time, but although there is a superficial 'classical',restraint, there are no classical overtones. Champaigne's austerity in fact predated that of Poussin, and its source was the portrait painting of the fifteenth-century Netherlandish masters. Champaigne did not hesitate to use the conventions of almost two hundred years before, simply because they were successful ones. The convention of the man behind a ledge, typical of Van Eyck and the generation including Memling and Bouts that came after him, is made freer by Champaigne, who permitted a greater degree of realism in his work: for instance moisture is visible on the slightly open lips of the sitter.The sitter of this portrait is unidentified

43943-1deposi.jpg	"The earliest painting that can be ascribed to Rogier van der Weyden with any certainty is also the artist's greatest and most influential extant work: the great Deposition. It cannot have been painted very long after 1435, the year established by dendrochronological dating methods, which would also fit the circumstances of Rogier's life at the time. On the other hand, it must have been painted before 1443, the date of the earliest copy (in the Sint-Pieterskerk, Leuven). The Deposition was an altarpiece, intended for the chapel of the Confraternity of the Archers of Leuven, who commissioned it. (The two small crossbows in the lower spandrels of the tracery in the picture refer to the Confraternity.). Mary of Hungary (1505-1558), Regent of the Netherlands, acquired the painting from the Archers of Leuven before 1548. Later it came into the possession of her nephew King Philip II of Spain (1527-1598; king from 1556), who finally placed it in the monastery fortress of the Escorial he had founded near Madrid. At that time the Deposition formed the centre of a triptych, but there is no indication that the side wings were originally part of the work, it is more likely that the Deposition was originally a single panel.At about 2.2 meters high and 2.6 meters wide, the painting is very large by the usual standards of Early Netherlandish pictures; in terms of concept it is truly monumental. Ten figures in all cover the painted surface almost entirely, with their heads close to the upper edge of the panel. The body of Jesus has already been removed from the Cross, and is received by two elderly men, the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus. Surrounded by Jesus's mourning friends they are holding His dead body for a moment before setting it down. Mary is sinking to the ground in a faint beside her son, and is supported by John, the favourite disciple of Jesus, and by one of the holy women. On the extreme right, the despairing Mary Magdalene seems on the brink of collapse.The scene shown would have lasted for only a moment, but there is nothing momentary about its depiction, which is quite detached from the historical event. Rogier achieves this effect principally by placing the group in a painted niche like an altar shrine; the hill of Golgotha, the Place of Skulls where the Cross stood, is suggested only by skulls and arm bones on the narrow strip of stone floor. A connection is thus established with those gilded shrines holding painted statues that were a particularly costly and lavish form of retable. However, Rogier was not imitating a carved altar. He shows ""live"" figures rather than statues, and the life-like effect is emphasized by their appearance, almost life-size, in the place where mere wooden statues would be expected in an altar. Using such methods, Rogier gives them the three-dimensionality of statues but the look of a painting, which is much more life-like than sculpture.However, such considerations would have played only a minor part in Rogier's decision to set the scene in the painted altar niche. His primary concern was to emphasize the forcefulness of the depiction. Rogier even departs deliberately from what can be rationally imagined, and so breaks with the manner of realistic spatial depiction that had only recently been achieved in painting. The niche he paints is deep enough at the bottom of the picture to accommodate several figures, the upright of the Cross, and the ladder leaning against it; but in some areas at the top it seems to come close to the surface of the picture - the helper on the ladder is pressed tightly into the shallow upper space of the shrine, while the head of the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea just below seems to protrude from the picture. All the figures are brought forward by the golden back wall so that the space surrounds them closely: convincing as their actions may look individually, there would never really have been room for them all. The result is a sense of timelessness and an almost oppressive intensity.The painted niche offered Rogier another advantage: he could retain the gold background usual in medieval painting without offending against the demands of naturalistic depiction. The background of the painting is, in fact, a real gilded surface and also a pictorial representation of one - the back of the shrine.Rogier relates the figures to each other in a masterly composition, yet he emphasizes a number of different accents. The limp body of Christ is at the centre, and appears to be held quite naturally by the two men so that it is almost facing the observer, with hardly anything else encroaching on it. This is the part of the picture intended to inspire the greatest reverence, referring to the sacrament in which, in the Catholic faith, the host and the wine become the body and blood of Christ. During divine service the bread and wine would have stood on the altar below this picture, and when the priest raised the host above his head during the ceremony, the congregation would have seen him doing so directly in front of the painted body of Christ.The almost radiant body is immaculate and beautiful, undisfigured by the marks of scourging, and its delicate but almost swelling form has a distinctly sensuous softness. Only the marks of the five wounds are ugly gashes running with blood. However, the long trickle from the wound in Christ's side passes over the body like a delicate line that traces the curve of the stomach.The other main character in the picture is Mary. The Mother of God, sinking to the ground as if dead, forms a parallel to Christ, allowing the artist to create a link between the two main groups in a bold effect of composition, since they are moving in different directions: Christ is being carried away to the right, while Mary is falling to the left. At the same time, the correspondence between the figures illustrates an important theological idea of the time Mary's own compassionate suffering and her part in Christ's act of redemption. On the right of the picture not directly involved in the action, stands Mary Magdalene. Her magnificent, worldly garments, with the low-necked dress showing her full, sensuous breasts, indicate that she is the ""great sinner"" who has abandoned her depraved way of life and turned to Christ in repentance. In terms of composition, the Magdalene's figure closes off the picture on the right like a large bracket, matching the similarly bowed figure of John on the left. The curve of Mary Magdalene's cloak, sweeping forward into the picture, is echoed by the hem of the brocade robe worn by Nicodemus, and is continued in the left half of the picture by the folds in the Virgin Mary's blue dress. Such overlapping forms and lines determine the structure of the whole picture: the curve of Christ's body is continued in the Magdalene's left arm, and is crossed by the diagonal running in the opposite direction from the eyes of Nicodemus, through the hands of Christ and Mary, to the eye sockets of the skull. Christ's left arm too echoes the movements that seem to curve and turn on each other at the centre of the picture.The Deposition is among the outstanding masterpieces of Netherlandish art, and one of the mainstays of Rogier's fame. As the work of a painter aged 35 to 40, it can hardly be described as a youthful production, yet only with this painting can we begin to see Rogier more clearly as an artistic personality. Most important of all, the picture shows unmistakable similarities with some of the major works of the Master of Fl�malle"

10628-river_la.jpg	This large canvas, arguably the greatest of all Cuyp's landscapes, was probably painted in the late 1650s, and represents the culmination of his career as a landscape painter. Following his marriage to a wealthy widow in 1658, Cuyp seems to have abandoned painting. Cuyp's patrons, with those of his father, the portrait painter, Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp, appear to have been members of the regent families of Dordrecht and this landscape, with its remarkable effects of sunlight and the extraordinary delicacy in the treatment of details, was presumably intended to hang in the house of a member of this group which Cuyp joined by marriage. In a print of 1764, made shortly after the painting arrived in England, it is identified as a view of the River Maas at Dordrecht. In fact, it is an imaginary landscape, with mountains on a scale which cannot be found in The Netherlands. Cuyp may, however, have referred to drawings of actual views he made in his sketchbooks, particularly those made on a visit to Nijmegen and Cleves in 1651-2.The painting was purchased in the United Provinces by Captain William Baillie in about 1760. He acted as an agent for John, Earl of Bute, in the formation of the art collection which hung at Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire. According to Benjamin West, it was this picture which began the rage for landscapes by Cuyp among British collectors. On 18 May 1818, Joseph Farington wrote in his diary: 'I went to the British Institution and there met Mr. West and I went round the exhibition with him examining all the pictures. While looking at Lord Bute's picture by Cuyp, he said that picture was brought to England by the late Captn. Baillie, and was the first picture by that master known in England. Having been seen pictures by Cuyp were eagerly sought for and many were introduced and sold to advantage'.The painting was purchased from the Marquess of Bute by the National Gallery in 1989

39753-02mirror.jpg	Titian's early series of female portraits are one of the glories of the Venetian Renaissance. Depicted with loving care, his sitters - however idealized in the final composition - are too full of life and character not to have been taken from the model.The Woman with a Mirror is probably among the earliest of these works: in comparison to others in the series, she is seen from a more frontal angle behind the parapet and in terms of atmosphere appears less integrated within the ambient space. She stands between two mirrors held up by an admirer in such a way that she can see herself and her admirer and we can see her from both front and back. This arrangement refers to the claims of painting to surpass sculpture, by presenting an all-round view with colour as a bonus. Her expression has little to do with vanity, a common gloss on images of women before a mirror, and shows an unaffected and dawning delight in her own attractions which the viewer, like her admirer, is expected to share. Thus the picture is a celebration of her beauty, enhanced by the possibility of its being admired from different aspects by all concerned - herself, her lover and the spectator

09536-fresco2.jpg	This fresco was originally part of a cycle of paintings in the former reception room of the Casa Bartholdy in Rome. They were painted in 1815-17. At the end of the 19th century the frescoes were taken down and moved to Berlin. Jacob's Lament is by Schadow, while Philipp Veit (1793-1877) painted the lunette above it, The Fat Years, and the large-scale Joseph and Potiphar's Wife. Cornelius painted the Joseph Interpreting Pharaoh's Dream - also crowned by a lunette, The Lean Years by Overbeck - and The Recognition of Joseph by his Brothers. The artists regarded the cycle as their main work and they all made watercolour versions on a small scale, which were shown in the Berlin Academy exhibition in the autumn of 1818, framed with architectural divisions.

15873-tarquin.jpg	The story of the rape of Lucretia was one of the best-known episodes in the early history of Rome. It told how Sextus Tarquinius, brutal son of the tyrannical king, forced the virtuous wife Lucretia to accede to his lust by threatening that he would kill both her and her servant-boy if she refused, and afterwards claim that he had discovered them together in the act of adultery. To prevent this dishonour to her husband and family, Lucretia permitted herself to be raped, and was thereby able to tell her story and demand vengeance before she committed suicide.Giordano's composition recalls a celebrated precedent, painted by Titian and known in several versions.

08625-richeli.jpg	Born in Brussels, Philippe de Champaigne settled in Paris in 1621 and became one of the city's leading artists, painting portraits and religious compositions for the Queen Mother, Marie de' Medici, the court of Louis XIII, the city administration, fashionable congregations and private individuals. Trained in Flanders and influenced by his compatriots Rubens and Van Dyck, he gradually rejected the flamboyance of their style for a more severe and naturalistic idiom. The change is particularly noticeable after 1645 when he became sympathetic to the rigorous doctrines of the Dutch Catholic theologian Cornelis Jansen, practised at the Paris convent of Port Royal where Champaigne sent both his daughters to school.The sitter for this grandiose portrait, however, is obviously not one of the artist's Jansenist patrons: where they wear sober black, he wears crimson; where they appear against a plain grey background, he stands in a palatial gallery against a great Baroque swathe of curtain, a glimpse of his ch&#226;teau gardens behind him. He is Armand-Jean du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu (1585-1642), cardinal, Chief Minister to the King and virtual ruler of France from 1624 until his death. Richelieu consolidated the central powers of the crown and put down the Huguenot rebellion. He created the French merchant navy and effective fighting fleets in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. On land, he challenged the might of the Habsburg Empire. To readers of Alexandre Dumas, he will always be the haughty antagonist and sometime patron of the (four) Three Musketeers - but then, Dumas had Champaigne's portraits of Richelieu on which to base his unforgettable character.Unable to have himself portrayed as ruler, Richelieu stands in the pose traditionally associated with French monarchs. (It was pointed out how rare it is for a cardinal to be shown standing - 'Like women, they sat'.) Richelieu wears the chivalric Order of the Saint-Esprit, its blue moir� ribbon contrasting with the starched white linen and the crimson satin of his collar and cloak. Instead of a baton or cane, he holds a scarlet biretta in his stiffly extended right hand. This extraordinary object seems to float up to the surface of the canvas in defiance of spatial logic; as it hypnotically draws our glance we become aware of its tacit message. Champaigne has carefully shown its inner lining catching the light, thus drawing attention to our viewpoint from below - an optical fact underscored by the low horizon line beyond. We are gazing upwards at Richelieu, his face the distant apex of an elongated pyramid down which lustrous drapery flows like lava. Although diminished in scale by the distance between us, the face is undistorted by foreshortening like the majestic images of Christ the Ruler in the apses of Byzantine churches. But where these spiritual icons look deep into our eyes, the King's Minister stares haughtily out, allowing us to look at him...as a cat may look at a king

35103-demons1.jpg	"The two paintings, A Friar Tempted by Demons and Anchorites Tempted by Demons, were acquired by the National Gallery with an attribution to Magnasco. This attribution was maintained by the Gallery until 1997, even though the quality of the paint surface and the brushstrokes - larger than the brief and nervous strokes of Magnasco - lead to questions about it. The discovery of the monogram signature ""SR"", made during a recent restoration, has enabled the attribution of the painting to Rosa.The theme of desert hermits is a recurring motif in Rosa's work during the first half of the 1660's. In 1661 he painted the altarpieces of St Paul the Hermit for the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Milan; while a 1662 letter from the artist to Giovanni Battista Ricciardi recounts how impressed he had been by seeing real hermitages in the wild landscape of the Apennine mountains during a trip to Loreto.In the backgrounds of the National Gallery's two oval canvases, savage nature devours the remains of classical buildings. In such pictures, Rosa anticipated the eighteenth century trend for pictures of ruins. Conversely, the later taste for such romantic expressions explains why Rosa's pictures were particularly prized by connoisseurs of the following centuries. Rosa's written satire Babylonia against the Court of Rome, composed in 1657-58, is a literary reflection of the same themes. The subject of the tormented monk also connects to the demon and witch pictures that appear in Rosa's work as early as the late 1640's when the artist, at the end of his Florentine sojourn, wrote the poem The Witch. Another recurring motif is the arched opening through which a luminous background is visible. The contrast between this background luminosity and foreground grimness has parallels in numerous works of Rosa, stretching back to the very beginning of his career (for example the Landscape with Waterfall at the Palazzo Pitti)"

44410-miravan.jpg	"Antiquity was the great theme in British painting in the last decades of the 18th century.  Its influence can be traced in two areas particularly - in literature, which often comes close to the macabre, and in the excavations of antique sites, which were followed with intense interest at the time. Joseph Wright's Miravan Opening the Grave of his Forefathers illustrates an example from literature. One story is that Miravan found on the grave of his forefathers the inscription: ""In this grave lies a greater treasure than Croesus possessed."" But the central character finds only bones and another inscription: ""Here dwells rest! Criminal, you seek gold among the dead? Go, greedy one, you will never find rest!"" The subject has a double meaning. It not only illustrates the legend itself, but was also probably intended as a criticism of the growing desecration of antique sites"

10020-rape_eur.jpg	Coypel best survives today in a fairly homogeneous group of mythological pictures, not on too vast a scale, which breathe a lively hedonism and relaxation without insipidity. They form a distinct link between the Regence and Boucher.The Rape of Europa is probably Coypel's masterpiece and it stands in its own right as well as being a remarkable anticipation of Boucher's Birth of Venus. Coypel took part in the concours (competition) of 1727 with the Rape of Europa which, though not awarded a prize or bought by the Crown, was highly thought of by some connoisseurs. It deserved to win the concours of 1727, but the injustice then done to Coypel was remedied by the Comte de Morville, a secretaire d'etat, who shrewdly bought the picture and paid for it the amount the king had promised for the winning work; the ultimate loser was to be the French state.Although Coypel never went to Italy, his art owes a great deal to the example of Correggio and also, it is reasonable to guess, to Rosalba Carriera. Coypel practised as pastellists, almost certainly under her influence. Noel-Nicolas  was  praised by discerning contemporaries for religious work as well as for mythologies - but most of the former has been destroyed

17151-portra03.jpg	"Catalogue numbers: F 431, JH 1519.Portrait of a Girl ('La Mousme')Oil on canvas, 74 x 60 cm. July 1888. Washington, National Gallery of Art, Chester Dale CollectionIn June 1888 van Gogh had been reading a novel, Madame Chrysanth�me, ostensibly about Japan, written by the popular and prolific Pierre Loti. Loti's descriptions of the young Japanese girl, known as Mousm�, much impressed van Gogh, and he gave this portrait of an Arlesian girl the same Japanese title. Loti's travelogues and novels about his visits to Japan provided van Gogh with a spurious picture of the Far East. Loti showed little insight into Japanese life and culture. They were seen through the eyes of a Western tourist, only for their Oriental exoticism and strangeness, by turns luxurious and primitive. Van Gogh, the Dutch tourist in Provence, seems to have viewed its life and people with as little comprehension. He took a superficial delight in what he saw as picturesque, quaint, different, and felt free to 'orientalize' a local Arlesian girl.On July 29, 1888, van Gogh wrote his younger brother Theo, an art dealer in a Parisian gallery, that ""if you know what a 'mousm�' is (you will know when you have read Loti's Madame Chrysanth�me), I have just painted one. It took me a whole week...but I had to reserve my mental energy to do the mousm� well."" Van Gogh's literary source was a popular novel from the period, whose story of a Frenchman's affair with a Japanese girl reflected the French fascination with Japanese culture"

38598-kermess.jpg	"As a painter of landscapes, genre scenes and still-lifes, David Teniers the Younger is one of the most popular artists of the Flemish school of the 17th century. Initially influenced by Adriaen Brouwer, Teniers abandoned his predecessor's truculent, anecdotal genre around the time of his death in 1638, going on to develop a much more refined style, vigorous, delicate, and full of verve, as well as a brilliant and clever painting technique distinguished by a very light brush and subtle colouring. He was already at the summit of his art when in 1651 Archduke Leopold Wilhelm appointed him painter to the Brussels court. This prince's protection guaranteed him an immense success. Commissions flowed in from foreign sovereigns, in particular Phillip IV of Spain, forcing the artist to produce ever more and faster. The quality of his works, with simpler and less vigorous compositions, and less delicate colouring, inevitably suffered.This canvas, of a size rare in Teniers' oeuvre, and dated 1652, shows a charming, well-behaved village kermess. The diagonal composition divides the painting into two, with a dark and less developed part to the left contrasting with the well-lit part to the right where the festivities are taking place in front of a series of houses. Divided into small groups, peasants in festive dress are dancing, eating, courting, chatting or simply listening to a bagpipe player. High-ranking figures who have just alighted from a barouche which remains in the shadow are approaching the kermess, but without real contact with the festive countryfolk. It is very possible that these elegant walkers, shown face-on, represent the painter himself accompanied by his wife Anna, the daughter of Jan ""Velvet"" Brueghel, and that the castle in the background to the left is the manor of Drij Torens at Perk that the artist rented for a number of years before purchasing it in 1662. The joyful, relaxed family festivity is evoked by the warm harmony of brown and yellow tones, subtly broken by local patches of red, turquoise and, in particular, superb whites."

13906-stillife.jpg	Flegel, Germany's first purely still-life painter, is believed to have worked in the studio of the Flemish artist Lukas van Valckenborch as a painter of flowers, metalware and fruit, a fact that would certainly appear to be borne out by this painting.The very Netherlandish-looking bouquet of flowers with tulips, carnations, roses and narcissi, is as superbly painted as the silver vase ornamented with golden mascarons in which it has been placed. The different qualities of silver, gold and pewter, their various degrees of brilliance, hardness and finish have been rendered in painstaking detail. The heavy pewter plates are juxtaposed with an elegant, fine-rimmed silver dish and a golden-lidded chalice bearing a fine statuette of Mars. The blade of the knife at the edge of the table, the dish of hazelnuts, the lid and edge of the brown earthenware jug - all are variations on the artist's theme.The display of foodstuffs seems less impressive at first glance, and arranged almost at random. Everything seems to be arranged by pure chance, so much so in fact that an allegorical interpretation seems unlikely. Though the composition may appear purely cumulative, it is nevertheless precisely calculated, especially in the masterly distribution of colour highlights

24520-05clemen.jpg	"The picture shows the scenes St Catherine Disputing with Scholars and Martyrdom of the Scholars on the lower register of the left-hand wall. This wall is divided into three tall rectangular panels, but presents five different episodes. Utilizing the middle distance and background as the settings for scenes that follow and are directly related to the events depicted in the foreground, the painter managed to integrate additional episodes into his pictures without compromising their formal integrity as compositions. He does so most creatively in the left-hand section of the picture, where Catherine is seen disputing with scholars summoned by the emperor.The scene is set in a narrow, box-like room, with the emperor seated on his throne in front of the back wall and the scholars on the benches along the two side walls. Catherine stands in the centre, her gesture indicating that she is just making a point. A ""picture window"" on the right-hand wall allows us to look out at another scene, where the scholars, converted by the saint's words, are being put to the fire, but their bodies are unharmed by the flames"

22933-01concer.jpg	After several unfortunate attempts at historical paintings Pietro Falca, known as Pietro Longhi, turned, on his return from a stay in Bologna where he had particularly admired the popular art of Giuseppe Maria Crespi, to the depicting of Venetian society at the moment of its decline offering a witty view, with just a hint of irony, in which not even the smallest detail that can lend colour is neglected. Though the paintings look similar, they in fact offer an extremely wide range of subtly described and individualized personalities and moods of the characters engaged in often frivolous pursuits under the gaze, alternately ironic and ambiguous, of servants who rarely betray any sympathy or liking for their masters and mistresses. In the minute detail of his sharp reporting Pietro Longhi sees his age with a spirit of good-humoured optimism untinged by social and moral jjudgments. His art shows a close affinity with the work of Carlo Goldoni, a connection that was several times acknowledged by the great playwright himself.In this painting, his first genre canvas, Longhi depicts a scene of domestic concert. As three musicians concentrate on their performance, their distracted listeners enjoy a game of cards.

16647-humility.jpg	The Virgin is painted in a surprisingly thick impasto. She has small features under a tall brow and turban. She is at play with her child on the flowering summit of a little hill, seated on a brocade cushion and enclosed within a tightly packed orchard, bursting with fruit. The theme of the Virgin in the Garden is given a new dimension by the cosmic panorama that rears up behind as a tilted plane. Paths and boundaries are mapped out by microscopic trees and tiny white-dotted stones, painted with a miniaturist's precision. From the right, a river curves through the checkered fields, past the dark rock that guards the steep-walled city, and down into the lake. Variations of this chessboard panorama recur throughout Giovanni di Paolo's long career

44715-gonfalon.jpg	The most important brotherhood in Rome was that of the Gonfalone. It had its newly constructed oratory frescoed from 1568 to 1577, with many artists participating in the project. With the help of their cardinal protector, Alessandro Farnese, the members of the brotherhood were able to win over Jacopo Zanguidi, known as Il Bertoia, for the design of the decorative system. Painted Solomonic columns articulated a history cycle and supported an elaborate entablature, above which, in an upper zone of the wall, prophets and sibyls sit with scrolls, Old Testament kings, and virtues. The narratives of the paintings depict the Passion of Christ from the entry into Jerusalem to the Resurrection.

07492-191captu.jpg	The attribution of the painting is doubtful. Another version of this subject is in the Museum of Western and Eastern Art, Odessa.The main figures are pushed to the left, so that the right-hand half of the picture is left to the soldiers, whose suits of armor absorb what little light there is, and whose faces are the most part hidden. At the right of the picture, an unhelmeted head emerges from the surrounding darkness. This is often regarded as the artist's self-portrait. Caravaggio has also concerned himself here with the act of seeing as one of a painter's task. The three men on the right are there mainly to intensify the visual core of the painting, underscored by the lantern. On the left, the tactile aspect is not forgotten. Judas vigorously embraces his master, whilst a heavily mailed arm reaches above him towards Christ's throat. Christ, however, crosses his hands, which he holds out well in front of him, whilst St John flees shrieking into the deep night. His red cloak is torn from his shoulder. As it flaps open it binds the faces of Christ and Judas together - a deliberate touch on the artist's part

07795-061virgi.jpg	If formal history is Mantegna's outstanding characteristic and reporting is Gentile Bellini's, then Carpaccio is predominantly a historical novelist. His urban settings are often compared with those of Gentile Bellini, but there are major differences between the two. Gentile used documentation to support the accuracy of his account, and where it was lacking he relied on his imagination, but always in terms of the topographic reality of Venice. Although Carpaccio's settings are entirely Venetian in spirit, they are complete fantasies and any reference to reality is scrupulously avoided. Almost all of Carpaccio's career was devoted to producing picture cycles, for the decoration of entire interiors, that illustrated religious themes and legends connected with Venetian life. These subjects called for compositions seen as if through an imaginary window, and they made up a fabulous but not unrealistic world.Carpaccio's urban views are not chance inventions. They belong to the Platonic idea of Venice as a painted city, which goes back beyond Jacopo Bellini's drawings, is articulated by Filarete and proliferates in the illustrations of his manuscripts. This is a development that is seen at the same time in Lombardy and in the Lombard buildings in Venice, creating a language of forms of which Carpaccio is a later prophet. Carpaccio's townscape, with its architecture, sculpture and street furniture, thus does not follow existing forms (note the invented Mannerist monuments in the background of The Disputation of St. Stephen) nor does it repeat familiar architectonic systems (see the interior divisions of the temple in The Marriage of the Virgin). The background of The Disputation is expressed in terms of exotic northern motifs.That the setting is the main theme in Carpaccio's work is shown also by his preliminary drawings, in which the scenes are empty of figures. In The Marriage of the Virgin, he limited the role of the figure and dwelt on the numerical rhythms, the geometry and the musical sequences of the setting. The other features of his art tend toward the same end, as for instance his use of the panoramic view, which in turn meant abandoning a monumental style. Planes dominate the surface, and atmospheric perspective gives way to a constant focus embracing nearby and distant images. In this view of the cosmos, Carpaccio had learned from Antonello da Messina how to introduce Flemish vision into Italian painting.

31011-st_james.jpg	To the testament of Andrea Stazio, a Venetian nobleman who died in 1722, we owe a cycle of paintings of great importance in the history of Venetian art. The will provided that twelve canvases should be painted for the church of San Stae (Venetian for St Eustace). All similar in size, they depict episodes in the lives of the Apostles and their martyrdom. The commission was given to twelve different Venetian painter, ranging from the aged Nicol&#242; Bambini, then seventy-one, through to Giambattista Tiepolo, almost at the start of his career.All the paintings were completed within a few months, in 1722 and early 1723. The artists were the following in alphabetic order: Antonio Balestra, Nicol&#242; Bambini, Gregorio Lazzarini, Silvestro Manaigo, Giambattista Mariotti, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giambattista Piazzetta, Giambattista Pittoni, Sebastiano Ricci, Giambattista Tiepolo, Angelo Trevisano and Pietro Uberti. They vied with each other to transform the church into a remarkable showcase of currents and developments in eighteenth-century Venetian art.Piazzetta's Martyrdom of St James is part of the cycle of the Apostles which as a 'collective exhibition' fortunately remained intact in the choir of the Baroque church San Stae, giving an outline of Venetian painting of the period.The small, light-suffused head of the rider emerging from the deep shadows in the foreground only just manages to soften the tension created by the contrast between the ruffian's brutality and the obstinate determination of the apostle, guided and illuminated by his faith

24102-8holyfam.jpg	Between 1490 and 1506, the year he died, Mantegna painted several devotional paintings in which the main figures are represented as reliefs standing out against a mostly dark background. Inspired by reliefs on classical tombs, these figures are shown partially hidden behind stone balustrades or a frame.The composition of the painting is clearly reminiscent of Antique reliefs, which use the same strict arrangement of figures in a row, with the heads all on the same level. The body of the Infant Christ standing on the lap of the Mother of God stands out with great plasticity from the dark background. The stern faces on the edge of the picture, Joseph to the left and Elizabeth to the right, resemble realistic Roman character busts, while Mary and the child show in their gracefulness a kinship to the Florentine reliefs of the early Renaissance, such as those by Luca delta Robbia. The young John the Baptist in the lower right corner is shown with his mouth open, as if in speech, and pointing up at Jesus. His gaze directed at the viewer, his gesture, and the banderole with the legend 'Ecce Agnus Dei' (Behold the Lamb of God) all point to his role as the forerunner of Jesus. The twig in the form of the cross can be seen as a symbol of Christ's later crucifixion, by which he takes away the sins of the world, according to the next lines of the Agnus Dei.The reminiscences of Antiquity in this painting show Mantegna's importance for the development of the art of the High Renaissance. The majority of commentators regard this as a late work and date it to the end of the fifteenth century

00474-venus1.jpg	Amigoni had spent his early career in Venice, but he left the city to make a name for himself as an international artist, quickly finding an avid audience in the various courts of Europe which had developed a taste for the charm of the Venetian Rococo. In 1730, Amigoni arrived in London fresh from a series of pictorial triumphs in Venice, Rome and at the court of the Elector of Bavaria, and soon had eager patrons amongst the English nobility and even royalty.The pair of canvases of mythological subjects, Venus and Adonis, and Bacchus and Ariadne, represent one of the most important works by Amigoni from his seminal English sojourn.

26550-1chapel2.jpg	"The picture shows a view of the interior of the chapel toward the entrance wall.According to the original decorative program (1475-83), the walls are divided into three orders by horizontal cornices; the lower of the three orders was to be painted with fictive ""tapestries,"" the central one with two facing cycles - one relating the life of Moses (left wall) and the other the Life of Christ (right wall), starting from the end wall, where the altar fresco, painted by Perugino,  depicted the Virgin of the Assumption, to whom the chapel was dedicated. The upper order is endowed with pilasters that support the pendentives of the vault. Above the upper cornice are situated the lunettes. Between each window below the lunettes, in fictive niches, run images of the first popes - from Peter to Marcellus - who practiced their ministry in times of great persecution and were martyred.Michelangelo later (1508-12) frescoed the ceiling with the pendentives, and the lunettes. After Michelangelo painted the ceiling, it was radically different in appearance from the chapel Sixtus IV had rebuilt and decorated. The artist did not overlook any element - beginning with a remarkable use of colour - that could harmonize his frescoes with those of the fifteenth-century decorative cycle, especially the figures of the popes in the niches between the windows, immediately below the lunettes.

39796-19aretin.jpg	Pietro Aretino was a well-known poet of his period. Exiled from Mantua he settled in Venice. He was famous because of his satirical poems.The portrait of Pietro Aretino was sent by the sitter to Florence in 1545 as a gift to Cosimo I. Titian has been kind to Aretino's dissolute, satyr-like features as we know them from other portraits and medals. Today one can safely admire the sleeves of silk velvet conjured up so economically by a few slashing brush strokes, but Aretino complained that the costume was not properly finished since Titian had not been paid enough. Wearing a chain and swathed in the deep red of the Venetian patriciate, he stands ennobled by his own efforts, a potent advertisement for the rewards available to men of talent in the liberal and tolerant embrace of the Serenissima

37275-2s_louis.jpg	The altarpiece represents St Louis of Toulouse seated with his brother, Robert the Wise, kneeling before him.Louis of Anjou was born in 1274, the second son of Charles II of Anjou, king of Naples, and was the designated heir to the throne. However, he felt called to a spiritual life, and renounced his claim to the throne in 1296. Now his younger brother Robert became heir apparent, Louis was appointed bishop of Toulouse by Pope Boniface VIII, but at the same time asked for permission to enter the Franciscan order. However, as early as 1297 he died on his way to Rome. The attempts to have him canonized were beset with complications, and the process lasted through three pontificates, although numerous miracles had already been ascribed to him. It was not until 7 April 1317 that he was eventually canonized by Pope John XXII, who was close to Robert of Anjou.Robert, who had become king of Naples in 1309, donated the altar retable probably to the church of Santa Chiara in Naples. The large retable is framed with the heraldic lilies of Anjou.In accordance with his importance, St Louis of Toulouse is depicted seated in majesty with the appurtenances of a bishop (mitre, crosier, cope and glove), while wearing the Franciscan habit, on a backless chair, crowning his younger brother Robert. Louis himself is being crowned by two hovering angels, so that we are present at a dual occurrence: the saint is being crowned by divine decree, the king by the hand of the saint. In this way it is made clear that the divine will is transmitted to Robert too. It is a symbolic act of installation in office which seeks God-given legitimacy through the now canonized brother

30075-3wolfgaj.jpg	The picture shows one of the panels of the St Wolfgang Altarpiece.The Resurrection of Lazarus deviates from iconographical tradition in a number of respects. Firstly, the scene is moved into an indoor setting whose architecture reveals an astonishing mixture of contemporary forms borrowed from both the sacred and the secular spheres. Secondly, the narrative unfolds not from left to right, but from foreground to background. It is true that Lazarus' sisters are kneeling parallel to the pictorial plane in the foreground, and that Christ is gesturing in the same direction, but Lazarus himself is seen from behind and foreshortened towards the rear. The main lines of the composition reinforce this inward movement - the vaulted canopy above the tomb, for example, the arrangement of the figures into lines resembling a guard of honour, and finally the view through the arch in the central axis out into the distant landscape. The New Testament subject is effectively obliged to take place in this demonstration of the painter's supreme mastery of perspective.Pacher must undoubtedly have studied the works of Mantegna, and the figure of Lazarus almost seems to anticipate the latter's Dead Christ (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan). The principle underlying Pacher's composition points even further into the future, however, insofar as the vanishing lines converge not upon one central object or figure, but rather allow the eye to escape, as it were, out into the open countryside

12059-violonpl.jpg	This painting provides an example of Dou's use of a niche format in which an arched top enhances the illusion by eliminating what are normally the empty upper corners of a picture. A man, likely identifiable as a painter because of his beret, peers at a birdcage while playing the violin in a stone enclosure. He leans against a sumptuous Turkish carpet draped over a magnificent stone relief of putti playing with a goat. This relief, which Dou used repeatedly in his niche paintings, is based on a frieze by the renowned Flemish sculptor Fran�ois Duquesnoy, plaster copies of which were known in Leiden at this time. In the background another man smokes a pipe while still another grinds pigment before an easel. In light of this background scene the subject of this panel can probably be identified as that of an artist playing a musical instrument in his studio, a subject encountered in other genre paintings (and in artists' self-portraits). Generally speaking it illustrates music's ability to stimulate creativity.

02492-2seaso1.jpg	"This painting belongs to a four-part cycle of the Seasons which was frequently repeated by the Milan artist for the Imperial court in Vienna and Prague. This particular series, which is now in Paris, had been commissioned by the Emperor Maximilian II for Augustus the Elector of Saxony.The series of the Seasons in the Louvre differ from the original Viennese model in the nature of the support, with canvas taking place of wood. The majority of the known versions of the Seasons are painted on canvas. This support may have been chosen for the convenience of the transport for which these works were intended by the man who commissioned them.The series in the Louvre is the only one to have a border formed of garlands of leaves and flowers around the heads. This feature is clearly a later addition as the greenery is depicted in a perfunctory fashion with a broader brush and in places clumsily superimposed on Arcimboldo's painting. It is assumed that it was added in the 17th century at the time of the restoration and enlargement of the original canvas.The Italian art historian Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo (L'Idea del Tempio della pittura, Milan, 1590) described Arcimboldo's allegories as ""teste composte"" (composed heads). The underlying principle of these compositions is the use of elements from an object area which is clearly distinct from others and in such a way that they add up to a personified figure. The individual elements as such do not have any mimetic properties; they only receive them when they co-occur with others."

17738-306goya.jpg	This picture is considered to be one of Goya's finest female portraits.Maria Rita Barrenechea y Morante, born in about 1700, married Count del Carpio in November 1775; she died in 1795, and perhaps it is the approach of death which stamps such anxiety on the feverish, languid face, with its great dark eyes. The slender silhouette seems to materialize like a ghost in front of the plain background; in this simple picture, free of all rhetorical devices and exercising a curious fascination by reason of this very simplicity, one finds the strange 'supernatural' quality common to all the masterpieces of Spanish painting. The sylph-like body is only the fleshly covering of a burning spirit. We know that the Countess del Carpio was a cultivated woman; she wrote some poetry which was printed atjaen in 1783.The pose is a curious one; the position of the feet, one at right angles to the other, suggests that she is about to perform a dance step, but this is belied by the calm and relaxed position of the crossed hands with the fan.The marquise, mature in years, stands before us wearing a serious expression - Goya's women do not smile - and in a very proud pose. There is nothing in the background to distract attention away from her. With the exception of the face, mantilla and pink bow, the palette is sombre. A masterpiece of Goya's ascetic portraiture.This picture is sometimes called the 'Marquesa de la Solana'; the Count del Carpio only inherited this title a few months before his wife's death. This portrait is usually considered to belong to Goya's 'grey' period, just before the illness (1792) which made him deaf and gave his art a more pathetic quality. This picture is a subtle harmony of greys and black, with a single note of colour &#151; the pink ribbon rosette in the woman's hair

10464-lutist.jpg	The lute is a plucked string instrument with a fretted neck and a deep round back. The origins of the lute are obscure. Various types of lutes were in use in ancient cultures. The most important point of transfer of the lute from Muslim to Christian European culture might have been in Sicily, where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Saracen musicians. Over the course of the Baroque era the lute was increasingly relegated to the continuo accompaniment, and was eventually superseded in that role by keyboard instruments. The lute fell out of use after 1800.

37823-poorpoet.jpg	"Spitzweg was regarded as the secluded ""painter-poet of Munich's Heumarkt,"" an eccentric who never displayed his extensive traveling. With Spitzweg Biedermeier painting as such comes to an end. He is still describing this world, but with the objectivity and distance of the observer. He can invest the seemingly idyllic scenes and subjects with a humour that is often biting. The Poor Poet is and apt example of this.Three versions of the Poor Poet are known. It is thought that Etenhuber (1720-82), a poet living in impoverished circumstances in Munich, was the model. Spitzweg shows the poet writing in bed to keep warm, for there is snow outside on the roofs and he has no wood to heat the stove. But he seems unconcerned at his scant means and the leaking roof, and his pen in his mouth, he counts off the meter of his rhyme on his fingers"

42012-aurora.jpg	The Casino dell'Aurora is the only portion spared from nineteenth-century demolition of the Villa Ludovisi (later Villa Boncompagni Ludovisi) in Rome. Originally the Casino, erected around 1570 and enlarged in the nineteenth century, was a three-story structure on a cruciform ground plan. During the pontificate of Pope Gregory XV Ludovisi the villa and its casino were used mainly for official functions such as dinners for the college of cardinals.The Casino is decorated by paintings on the ground floor and the second floor. Giovanni Luigi Valesio was the author of the ceiling painting in the former library on the ground floor in the Casino Dell'Aurora. It simulates an opening above a balustrade depicted in perspective. Behind it gambol crowds of putti with intertwining bands whose isolated letters produce Cardinal Ludovisi's name and title. The background is painted in a deep rich shade of blue. The ceiling is a visual feast of rich colours, movement and joy

38574-kitch_sc.jpg	It was part of the 17th-century aristocratic feast to include artistically moulded creations made from luxury food or shaped as pies. This formed part of 'display meals' which - as the name suggests - were indeed intended rather to delight the eye than the palate. On the other hand, it was also possible to combine both. This painting contains a swan pie - a festive decoration which has apparently only just been finished in the kitchen. Underneath the swan there was a real, edible pie (though probably not made from the flesh of a swan, which would have tasted rather too oily). The swan itself consisted the stuffed bird, decorated with a crown.Teniers's painting contained allusions to the political situation at the time. The crust of the pie is decorated with the double eagle of the House of Habsburg, and suspended from the swan's neck there is an emblem showing folded hands and a burning heart as symbols of the Christian faith

38634-brothel.jpg	"This painting having the popular title of Parental Admonition (another version in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) was the subject of a charming passage by Goethe. In his ""Die Wahlverwandtschaften"" Goethe notes the delicacy of attitude of the figures. He remarks how the father quietly and moderately admonishes his daughter who is seen from behind. The woman in black, sipping from a glass, Goethe interprets as the young woman's mother, who lowers her eyes so as not to be too attentive to the 'father's admonition'. This moralizing title, however, is without foundation and not in accordance with Ter Borch's usual themes.The authoritative biographer of the artist interprets the picture in the opposite sense, as a brothel scene, assuming that the seated gentleman holds a coin in his right hand, offering it to the girl. In fact, the detail of the coin is not visible. (The coin is omitted in the engraving Goethe knew). In the Berlin version the passage is rubbed; a former owner may have had it painted over because she or he found it an embarrassing allusion. The Amsterdam version does not show the coin either, but its original paint surface is generally abraded; thus it is impossible to tell if it ever included the tell-tale coin.Ter Borch's psychology is so delicate that the  common scenes he repeatedly painted are raised to the level of highly civilized life. That Goethe's interpretation was possible at all shows the refinement of Ter Borch's treatment. Even if he made a mistake, Goethe had the right feeling for the way Ter Borch treated his subjects. Psychologically and pictorially he retains a sensitive touch and delicacy. The young woman is seen from behind; thus her face is averted. The only flesh visible is her neck, which is modelled with tender, silvery grey shadows. We have, however, opportunity to admire the silver-grey satin and black velvet of her gown.Ter Borch's minuteness and nicety of handling concentrate largely on painting stuffs. Contrary to Vermeer's paintings, the dim light and the subdued chiaroscuro do not allow a forceful grasp of the whole field of vision. The light comes mostly from the front and stops at the glossy surfaces of the costumes and other textures"

24869-madonna2.jpg	In Florence in the first half of the fifteenth century the market for devotional images was dominated by sculpture, not painting. Consequently, sculptural reliefs exerted a profound influence on painted compositions of the Madonna and Child. The present painting by the Master of Pratovecchio faithfully repeats the features of a terracotta relief by the sculptor Michele da Firenze, who worked on Ghiberti's first set of doors for the Florence Baptistery. The composition of the relief on which this painting is based has a strongly Gothic flavour, with the Virgin seated beneath a tent-like canopy, form the apex of which a half-length figure of God the Father emerges, with angels piled up at the sides

24934-luxembou.jpg	"Before an ornamented gold brocade ground kneels the figure of a young man in prayer, his head outlined by a halo. There is a lectern before him and an open prayer-book on it, resting on a purple cushion. He raises his enraptured eyes to the figure of Christ on the Cross on the left-hand side wall. Peter of Luxembourg, according to early sources, died at the age of eighteen, by which age he was already a cardinal. He had subjected himself to every type of mediaeval self torture and ascetic mortification of the flesh: ""Ascetic, horribly dirty and covered with vermin, amidst the unbridled luxury of the courts of Berry and Burgundy, and incessantly confessing to sins he had probably not committed."" Such is the picture his contemporary Froissart gives of him in his chronicle, but in this painting produced, some sixty years after his death (1387), the grim mortification of the ascetic has been modified to the figure of an idealized young saint, now the object of a religious cult. In Huizinga's words ""a striking representative of the type of 'under-witted' saint"", he had been transformed into a saint in the course of the years immediately following his death, and the Avignon master was more influenced by his later reputation than by the reality of his life"

18033-39old.jpg	In 1659, the Riccardi family bought the Palazzo Medici and undertook some structural changes. This included, in 1689, the building of an exterior flight of stairs leading up to the first floor. For this purpose the entrance to the chapel had to be moved. During the process, two sections of wall were cut out of the south western corner, in the Procession of the Oldest King. After the stairs were finished, the cut out elements were mounted on a corner of the wall projecting into the room.

40212-nudegirl.jpg	F�lix Trutat was a French painter who died too young. He made his debut  at the age of 20 with this painting. In it one senses not only that the young painter had perceptions and sensibility in advance of his time, in that he anticipates an almost naturalistic approach, but one recognizes also that the presentation of intimacy is comparable with that in Goya's Maja paintings. Trutat, too, lets there be no doubt that this is a painting of a real person, and not a model transformed into a general aesthetic. He did lay a Tyrsos stave on Bacchus' panther skin, to create a mythological identity for the nude, and the head of an old man in the background - borrowed from the biblical iconography of Susanna with the elders - makes the girl seem even more youthful, as it is slightly enlarged

41739-3agapit2.jpg	Two double-sided panels, one depicting scenes from the life of St Agapitus of Praeneste, and another depicting scenes from the life of St Remigius (Remi), bishop of Reims, must originally have formed the folding wings of an altarpiece. The lost altarpiece probably had another pair of folding wings.St Agapitus is a third-century martyr saint. According to his legend, 15-year-old Agapitus, who may have been a member of the noble Anicia family of Praeneste (modern Palestrina), was condemned to death, under the prefect Antiochus and the emperor Aurelian, for being a Christian. He was thrown to the wild animals in the local arena at Praeneste. The beasts refused to harm him, and he was beheaded.One side of the Agapitus panel shows the saint seated in a walled enclosure, surrounded by lions and bears. His persecutors observe from the balcony at the upper right. The saint's beheading outside the walls of Praeneste appears on the other side of the panels.Comparison with other existing panels from workshops in northern Switzerland indicates that the panels were originated in that region

34924-05gartem.jpg	The fresco cycle in the vault of the monastery church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe narrates stories from the Old Testament in a rather confusing sequence. When establishing the narrative composition, priority was given to the arrangement of narrative events rather than to the continuous narrative flow. Thus, popular subjects, such as the building of the Tower of Babel, were made to stand out in spectacular fashion.The scene depicting the building of the Tower of Babel even turns into a kind of visual instruction in the state of the medieval building trade: the rough-hewn ashlar blocks are carried along on men's shoulders. Holding an angle-iron in his right hand, we see an architect standing on the tower, about to take up a stone which somebody is handing to him. A mason in the foreground is taking mortar out of a bucket. next to the bucket there is a cable which used to pull up the container. Then, suddenly, God the Father makes his appearance in order to punish the worker's actions with the confusion of tongues

34945-5oberze1.jpg	The church of St. Georg in Oberzell on Reichenau Island is the home of one of the few narrative picture cycles on the subject of Christ's miracles to have survived as a complete set from the Ottonian period. It was certainly painted by Byzantine-trained artists who continued their travels after completing their work in Oberzell.The continuous painted cycle running around the walls of the nave was designed from the very beginning as a narrative cycle. With a single exception, Jesus enters each scene from the left, thus establishing the direction of reading from left to right. The viewer entering the space will also start on the left side, the north wall. There we have the Gerasene demoniac, followed by the Healing of the Sick, the Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and the Healing of the Man who was Born Blind. The south wall contains the following scenes: the Healing of the Leper, the Raising of the Young Man, the Healing of the Woman of her Bloody Issue, the Raising of the Daughter of Jairus and the Raising of Lazarus from the Dead.The picture shows the south wall

32422-new_york.jpg	In 1908, the artists group Ash Can School (or The Eight) announced new bearings in 20th-century American art. Its members concentrated on the unappealing sides of modern urban life. Maurice Prendergast tried to reconcile this subject-matter with a lyrical use of colour derived from Impressionism. The modernity of Prendergast's art did not reside in his subject-matter, it came from the priority he assigned technique over subject.Prendergast studied in Paris and readily absorbed Post-Impressionist aesthetics after 1890. His lively compositions guaranteed him success not long after his return to Boston in 1894. His work, often executed in watercolour, remained distinctively carefree even into the 20th century, at a time when frequent stays in New York had put him in touch with the Ash Can School

There, he encountered new tendencies in still-life painting and absorbed them in his own work. Kalf's style met with an eager following in Amsterdam already shortly after his arrival in that city; among the local artists who started to work in Kalf's style are Jurriaen van Streek and Christiaen Striep, to whom some paintings by Bergoijs was attributed until recently

10967-108david.jpg	David's first independent commission was for an altarpiece for the chapel of the Lazaret (or quarantine centre) in Marseille, France's major Mediterranean port, and a place that lived in continual fear of contagion brought by travellers from the East. The picture was to commemorate a miraculous episode from the 1720 outbreak of the disease in the city when the fourteenth-century saint, who had suffered from the plague himself, reappeared and came to the aid of the sick.David had tried to combine a depiction of a miracle, a visionary Baroque subject constructed according to the traditional rules, with the new manner of representation, which was no longer appropriate for the traditional approach. His clear neoclassical colouring, the evidently measurable proportions of the bodies, and the overall metrical construction all reveal the painful inability to combine on one level the earthly and the heavenly, the real story of the plague and its victim, with the historically intangible figures of the salvation. The painting is beautiful, but the realistic depiction of the suffering figures is much more moving for the viewer than is the Madonna, who is concerned with the child and not the pleading figure. The real and present suffering looks credible, but the religious aspect is no longer convincing. Paintings like this documented the end of religious painting for a long time

43835-aseaport.jpg	Jan Weenix took over this subject from his father and teacher, Jan Baptist Weenix, who had been a member of the Netherlandish artists' colony in Rome in the 1640s and had made a popular subject of the southern port. Like his father's works, An Italian Seaport is characterised by a balanced relationship between landscape and coast. Warmth of colour and citations from classical architecture give the painting its Italianate character. The knowledgeable viewer would have associated the temple with the Forum Romanum in Rome, though it does not of course stand by the sea. Also identifiable in the background is the Pyramid of Cestius, shown here taller and more sharply tapered. The urn on the plinth refers to the Medici Vase (now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence) which, from its discovery in 1583/84 until 1780, was part of the Medici collection in Rome, and which from the mid-seventeenth-century had become well known through its many depictions

39323-4cruci.jpg	Tintoretto's Crucifixion in the Sala dell'Albergo presents a panorama of Golgotha populated by a crowd of soldiers, executioners, horsemen, and apostles. At the left the cross of the penitent thief is being partly lifted, partly tugged into place by ropes; at the right the impenitent thief is about to be tied to his cross. A soldier on a ladder behind Christ reaches  down to take the reed with the sponge soaked in vinegar from another soldier on the ground. The tumult of the crowd, the grief of the apostles, and the yearning of the penitent thief seem to come to a focus in the head of Christ.Owing to Tintoretto's light-on-dark technique, his figures sometimes have a tendency to look a bit ghostly, but the foreground figures in the Crucifixion, grouped in a massive pyramid at the base of the cross, are defined by vigorous contours and are modelled to create a strong sculptural effect. The little group, huddled as if for protection against the hostile crowds, form the base of the composition.

15563-6baptis.jpg	"On the third level there are two frescoes, side by side, that deal with the mission of Saint John the Baptist. In the picture on the right he is preaching, and in the next picture he is baptizing Christ. The same landscape is continued through both scenes, linking them to one another.The sixth scene of the cycle depicts the  Baptism of Christ. This story shows, ""... his reverential attitude displaying the belief which he had in that sacrament, and... he represented a crowd of naked and bare-footed figures waiting to be baptised, their faces displaying faith and desire, one especially who is taking off his shoe being energy itself"" (Vasari).The Baptism of Christ is an emulation of the painting by Verrocchio and Leonardo in the Uffizi, though the angels and landscape are far weaker. There is a very old-fashioned feeling about the depiction of God the Father, who is giving His blessing surrounded by angels.In this painting the artist was interested less in depicting the baptism than in displaying variation of the nude figure. These were inspired both by Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel and also by classical sculpture. As early as the 1440s, in Piero della Francesca's Baptism of Christ, a magnificent nude figure had been depicted in the act of undressing. Piero's arrangement of the main figures also influenced of the version of the Baptism by Verrocchio and Leonardo"

26764-00lastju.jpg	"This fresco was commissioned by Pope Clement VII (1523-1534) shortly before his death. His successor, Paul III Farnese (1534-1549), forced Michelangelo to a rapid execution of this work, the largest single fresco of the century.The first impression we have when faced with the Last Judgment is that of a truly universal event, at the centre of which stands the powerful figure of Christ. His raised right hand compels the figures on the lefthand side, who are trying to ascend, to be plunged down towards Charon and Minos, the Judge of the Underworld; while his left hand is drawing up the chosen people on his right in an irresistible current of strength. Together with the planets and the sun, the saints surround the Judge, confined into vast spacial orbits around Him. For this work Michelangelo did not choose one set point from which it should be viewed. The proportions of the figures and the size of the groups are determined, as in the Middle Ages, by their single absolute importance and not by their relative significance. For this reason, each figure preserves its own individuality and both the single figures arid the groups need their own background.The figures who, in the depths of the scene, are rising from their graves could well be part of the prophet Ezechiel's vision. Naked skeletons are covered with new flesh, men dead for immemorable lengths of time help each other to rise from the earth. For the representation of the place of eternal damnation, Michelangelo was clearly inspired by the lines of the Divine Comedy:Charon the demon, with eyes of glowing coal/Beckoning them, collects them all,/Smites with his oar whoever lingers.According to Vasari, the artist gave Minos, the Judge of the Souls, the semblance of the Pope's Master of Ceremonies, Biagio da Cesena, who had often complained to the Pope about the nudity of the painted figures. We know that many other figures, as well, are portraits of Michelangelo's contemporaries. The artist's self-portrait appears twice: in the flayed skin which Saint Bartholomew is carrying in his left-hand, and in the figure in the lower left hand corner, who is looking encouragingly at those rising from their graves. The artist could not have left us clearer evidence of his feeling towards life and of his highest ideals.The painting is a turning point in the history of art. Vasari predicted the phenomenal impact of the work: ""This sublime painting"", he wrote, ""should serve as a model for our art. Divine Providence has bestowed it upon the world to show how much intelligence she can deal out to certain men on earth. The most expert draftsman trembles as he contemplates these bold outlines and marvellous foreshortenings. In the presence of this celestial work, the senses are paralysed, and one can only wonder at the works that came before and the works that shall come after"""

15005-tahiti63.jpg	"The most important paintings executed during Gauguin's second stay in Tahiti are the Nevermore, The White Horse, and Two Tahitian Women. ""Nevermore"" is the refrain of The Raven, a famous poem published in 1875 by Edgar Allan Poe.Nevermore is one of Gauguin's monumental nude paintings. It reflects the depression by which the painter was overcome in 1897 which led to his attempted suicide. This work is a free adaptation of Manet's Olympia, which Gauguin had copied before going to Tahiti in 1891. It attempts to suggest the superstitious dread of the Tahitian woman who lies alone in the foreground. Although Gauguin denied any association with Edgar Allen Poe's poem, the links are too obvious to be overlooked, particularly since it would have been well-known in the literary circles within which Gauguin moved, and had been illustrated in translation by Manet"

In the present work, Guercino illustrates the story of Semiramis called to Arms at the precise moment at which the Queen is interrupted at her toilette by a messenger bearing the news of the revolt of the Babylonians.

25204-adorati.jpg	"The artist of this painting is referred to as Master of Trebon (Wittingau).The graceful Virgin is dressed in a blue mantle with a red lining and is kneeling on an ornate cushion as if worshipping in front of an altar; she prays to her Child, who is firmly wrapped into swaddling clothes and rests in the watering trough-used as a cradle-of the stable. Behind Mary there stands Joseph, a simple man with a somewhat coarse face. His huge hand rests on the delicate lace shawl covering the fence. In the top corner on the right two sturdy shepherds with characteristic features and in torn clothes listen excitedly to the tidings of the birth of Jesus. At the bottom of the picture they appear again: they have come to adore the Infant. The environment is just indicated: on a terraced rocky ground there is only scanty vegetation. Tiny birds populate the whole scene. On the right-hand side there is a small genre picture with a group of oxen, sheep, a goat and a pig, the latter with a magpie on its back.The painting is a characteristic example of the attempt of the International Gothic style to unite opposites. The noble and clear contours of the Virgin and her ethereal and idealized figure differ markedly from the other characters of the scene, thick-set and cruder, but represented in a more shaded manner. Although Joseph and the shepherds are depicted naturally and without any prejudice, they follow the rules of a hierarchy in their very dimensions. While attempting to convey spatiality the artist also paid attention to a decorative arrangement of the surface. Spatial depth is indicated by means of the layered ground, and the way the stable building is set at an angle. Moreover, the mysterious semi-darkness of the scene also suggests space. At the same time the representation is strongly connected with the two-dimensional plane of the painting, the motifs being placed rather above than behind one another, thus evenly filling up the whole field of the picture. The poles supporting the stable divide the field into three parts and create a triptych-like arrangement with the Virgin and the Infant in the middle, while Joseph is on the left ""wing"" and the shepherds on the right one. The various forms meet in a harmonious way, such as, for example, the elongated back of the Virgin, parallel with the supporting poles of the stable, or her halo, beautifully fitting the supports of the roof. The only stressed line that crosses another one is the white-sleeved arm of the shepherd in yellow clothes and that of the pole supporting the stable. It is needed because the artist wanted to clarify the spatial position of the two figures. His way of thinking in terms of the plane of the picture is characteristically exemplified by the figures of the two shepherds in the background leaning against each other"

19456-flowers.jpg	Gardening and the breeding of beautiful hybrids satisfied the Dutch interest in art and in science. Exotic flowers also indicated their far-flung explorations and their expertise in botany. In fact, a &#147;tulip-mania&#148; swept Holland soon after tulips were imported from Turkey in the 1550s. In 1637, Amsterdam&#146;s commodity market in tulip bulbs crashed, causing capitalism&#146;s first depression.The thirty-one species of plants in this vase cannot bloom in the same season. Many of these blossoms have emblematic meanings. The upper flowers thrive in the sunshine that streams through De Heem&#146;s studio windows to be reflected in the crystal vase. The lower plants, farther away from the light of heaven, droop and wilt.Near the bottom, a salamander stares hungrily at a spider, while a snail, moth, and ants crawl on the marble shelf. All these creatures symbolize night and decay. On the white poppy at the top, a caterpillar and butterfly evoke the idea of rebirth from a cocoon or tomb.De Heem spent most of his career in Antwerp in Flanders. Colorful extravagance, typical of Flemish taste, imbues his still lifes, and De Heem passed this opulence on to his followers, including Abraham Mignon.
