19873-1darmst.jpg,"The Meyer or Darmstadt Madonna is the last, most famous and most effective of Holbein's great religious works, above all in its depiction of individual human identities combined with spectacular spatial control and illusionism - as exemplified by the ruckled carpet.Standing in a scalloped niche with projecting consoles, Mary, with the Christ Child in her arms, is surrounded by the Meyer family. The hooped crown, an allusion to the German imperial crown, identifies her as the Queen of Heaven. Typologically, the painting is a Schutzmantelbild (a `Virgin of Pity' painting), in which the donor, Jakob Meyer, invokes and gains divine protection for himself and his family. Unusually, the donor is shown as the same size as the Virgin.Chastened by worldly failure and disgrace, Meyer no longer staunchly outstares the world but has his eyes fixed on other realms in meditative intensity. This introspection is echoed by his wives the enigmatic enwrapped profile of his first, Magdalena Baer (who had died in 1511) and Dorothea Kannengiesser. Before them kneels Anna, the only surviving child, whose portrait drawing in chalk shows her with free-flowing hair. Holbein repainted her hair tied in a band after her engagement.In front of Jakob, in a Raphaelesque triangular pose deployed with subtlety and skill, his two deceased sons are depicted. The baby, with curly blonde hair and pudgy cheeks, has affinities with the Leonardo type. Also Leonardesque is the prowess shown in the foreshortening of the Christ-child's extended arm, and the naturalness of the baby's pose, which recall The Virgin of the Rocks",What does Meyer no longer staunchly outstare?,the world

18759-guard301.jpg,"Whereas Canaletto incorporates classically inspired structures or ruins into his fantastic views, and accords them an important place in the composition, Francesco Guardi's capriccios mostly refer to his own immediate surroundings: the Venetian Lagoon. In this poetic scene decorative fishing boats with yellow and brown sails are illustrated, lying in still, light-green water. Similar little ships also figure prominently in a number of Guardi's town views. In the foreground fishermen are seated together in an improvised tent, while elsewhere men are busy moving freight. The composition is constructed clearly, by means of coulisses which harmonize with the nuances in the palette. The thickly painted foreground consists of a sand bar and a hillock, behind which the fishing tent is located. The middle distance is formed by a spit of land with the remains of a wall on it in subdued, brown tones, and a large ornamental vase on a pedestal, a motif that Guardi may have borrowed from Marco Ricci. Directly behind this rises the wispy silhouette of the city, which stands out against the low sunlight. The various levels are connected to one another by the transparently painted water, which merges with the sky almost imperceptibly at the horizon.The theme of the walled city on the water is reminiscent of the capriccios Luca Carlevaris and Marco Ricci painted some fifty or sixty years earlier under the influence of seventeenth-century Roman examples. Guardi gave this view an unmistakably Venetian streak, however, by means of the Lagoon-like atmosphere and the striking belltowers, walls and roofs, which seem to be borrowed literally from the Venetian townscape",What are fishermen seated together in an in the foreground?,improvised tent

24485-01view.jpg,"The Bardi di Vernio Chapel in Santa Croce is one of the ten that were built at the same time as the transept between 1295 and 1310. It is located in the northern arm of the transept. The chapel was frescoed c. 1335 by Maso di Banco, one of Giotto's pupils and followers. Patronage of this chapel was not transferred to the Bardi di Vernio until 1602. In the fourteenth century it was the Bardi di Mangona, a branch of the family named after the Castello di Mangona near Florence, who were its patrons.In the upper part of the left (north) wall the St Sylvester cycle of Maso di Banco can be found. The two tomb monuments are unusually elaborated for family chapels of this period. The larger of the two, whose sarcophagus and marble baldachin were later added to the niche decorated by Maso, was for the male member of the family, the smaller one (the arcosolium, an arched recess used as a place of entombment) for the female members. Maso painted only the front wall of the latter, the interior of the niche is attributed to Taddeo Gaddi.On the fresco a male member of the Bardi family kneels on his sarcophagus, quite alone on the desolate plain of the afterlife. His sarcophagus is decorated with marble reliefs of the Man of Sorrows and the Bardi arms, while the image of Christ as a judge, displaying his wounds and surrounded by angels is painted in fresco on the wall above",Who was Maso di Banco one of?,of Giotto's pupils and followers

It is located in the northern arm of the transept. The chapel was frescoed c. 1335 by Maso di Banco, one of Giotto's pupils and followers. Patronage of this chapel was not transferred to the Bardi di Vernio until 1602. In the fourteenth century it was the Bardi di Mangona, a branch of the family named after the Castello di Mangona near Florence, who were its patrons.In the upper part of the left (north) wall the St Sylvester cycle of Maso di Banco can be found. The two tomb monuments are unusually elaborated for family chapels of this period. The larger of the two, whose sarcophagus and marble baldachin were later added to the niche decorated by Maso, was for the male member of the family, the smaller one (the arcosolium, an arched recess used as a place of entombment) for the female members.

21949-4lastsu3.jpg,"""Leonardo's painting of the Last Supper was constructed symmetrically according to the laws of central perspective, with a main figure, Jesus, in the centre. He is physically and psychologically isolated from the other figures and with his hands is pointing to the bread and wine, making the introduction of the Eucharist the central event. In Leonardo's conception, the other figures are reacting directly to Jesus, and at the same time, some of them are coming into contact with each other.James the Great, whose mouth is opened in astonishment, is sitting on the right next to Jesus, and spreading out his arms as if trying to say to the two disciples behind him, who are attempting to command the attention of Jesus with their eloquent gestures and the way they are pushing forward, that they should be quiet and listen.James the Less, the second from the left, places his hand on Peter's back, while Andrew next to him is still holding his hands before him and speaking, but his eyes are already seeking out Jesus. Peter and John are facing each other deep in conversation, just like the group of three on the far right who still seem to be animatedly discussing the previous announcement of the existence of a traitor.That this announcement has indeed already taken place is proven by the behaviour of John and Peter. In contrast with the usual manner of depiction, in which John is lying against Christ's chest, here Leonardo refers to the Gospel of St John (13:24): """"Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.""""By combining these two apostles into a group with Judas in this manner, Leonardo was distancing himself from the traditional scheme of depiction used for Last Suppers, according to which Peter and John sat to the right and left of Jesus. In contrast to the other apostles, however, he characterized them so clearly that they are identifiable to the observer. He identified Peter by means of the threatening dagger that he would, at dawn, use to cut off the ear of Malchus, one of the soldiers arresting Jesus.John, the favourite disciple, is wearing red and blue garments as is Jesus, and is seated at his right hand, the most honourable place. But Judas above all was clearly characterized by Leonardo, for he was not, as was customary, placed in the centre of the picture in front of the table, but placed amongst the row of disciples. He is identified by means of several motifs such as his reaching for the bread, the purse containing the reward for his treachery and the knocking over of a saltcellar, a sign of misfortune.
