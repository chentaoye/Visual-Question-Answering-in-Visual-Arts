31911-sylveste.jpg	San Giovanni in Laterano is the cathedral of Rome, and as such is the privileged seat of papal authority. The origins of this sacred edifice are rooted in legends. The best known among the many legends which sprang up in the Middle Ages tells that the emperor Constantine (280-337) was suffering from leprosy when Peter and Paul appeared to him in a dream and promised him he would get well if he were baptized. The pope at that time was Sylvester I (314-335), who had fled Rome for fear of persecution and lived in hiding among the forests of Mount Socrate. Reassured by the emperor, he agreed to return to Rome and baptize Constantine. Healed of his leprosy, Constantine as a sign of gratitude built the basilica of San Giovanni

15276-106gerid.jpg	The theme of G�ricault's Study of Feet and Hands is a fragment. Thus his still-life shows broken facets of an event, one that has resulted in the death of the individuals whose severed limbs are arranged here, in a dramatic scenario that unleashes emotional responses. G�ricault succeeds in lending the macabre motif a peculiar life of its own. It is as if the painter were concerned to dissolve the boundary between the part and the whole, the dead and the living. There is an air of tenderness in the way in which arm is draped around a foot. The intimate interlacing of a woman's arm and a man's legs may also conceal an element of eroticism.The limbs were possibly painted after living models. G�ricault painted fragments of body parts not only as preparatory studies for the greatest of his masterpieces, the Raft of the Medusa (Paris, Louvre); some he painted later as works more or less in a genre of their own: starting from functional oil sketches, he developed them into an autonomous form

43635-trajan.jpg	The subject is taken from the story in the Golden Legend in which a widow begs the Emperor Trajan (98-117) for vengeance for the death of her son who was murdered by the son of the Emperor. Though Trajan did give up his son to her, he was nevertheless condemned to Purgatory. Five hundred years later Pope Gregory the Great (circa 540-604) was so distressed that the pagan emperor Trajan had been consigned to Purgatory that he prayed to God to have a special exception made. God heard Gregory's prayer and Trajan was transferred to heaven. This tale was popularised in the Middle Ages by Dante in The Divine Comedy.The figures of the present picture were painted by Gillis Mostaert

37297-2agostin.jpg	The scenes are organized according to the composition of ex-votos, each one being divided into two sections: the accident and the miracle, followed by a thanksgiving prayer. The architectural settings of the scenes depict an overall view of Siena (in the Child Attacked by a Wolf), a view of the narrow streets of the city (in the Child Falling from a Balcony) and even an interior scene (in the Child Falling out of his Cradle, also known as the Paganelli Miracle); and in fact one could say that the city of Siena is indeed the co-protagonist of this painting. The buildings of the city centre are counterbalanced by the rural landscape in the scene of the Knight Falling down a Ravine, probably a depiction of the countryside immediately outside Siena, with the towers of faraway castles standing out amidst the bare hills

37801-manett02.jpg	The present fresco is one of the twelve fragments to survive from a fresco cycle devoted to scenes from the life of St John the Baptist in the Manetti Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence identified on the basis of engravings made by Thomas Patch in 1772. The frescoes were already in poor condition in 1763-64 when they were restored. When the church of the Carmine was largely destroyed by fire in 1771, they suffered comparatively little. Patch made the engravings in 1772 and removed some fragments from the wall, the rest was presumably destroyed in the reconstruction of the church.The fragment shows the head of St Elizabeth from the scene of the Visitation

01019-chess.jpg	That women could be intellectually accomplished and highly rational, even strategic, are the complementary themes of a family portrait showing Anguissola's three sisters playing chess. In this painting, which Vasari saw hanging in the artist's family home in Cremona in 1566, the chivalric game of chess takes place in an idealized landscape familiar in late medieval courtly images of the game and not in a tavern or other questionable locale seen in other contemporary representations of gaming. On the far left Lucia looks out at the viewer, dominating our gaze as her arm and obvious expertise dominate the chess board. She has removed two of Minerva's pieces from the game and the younger sister opens her mouth and raises her hand as if to speak. Their youngest companion, Europa, smiles gleefully at the match, carefully observed by an old maid servant at the far right.The three Anguissola women are members of a natural nobility capable of entertaining themselves, their status emphasized by the rich surface detail on their brocaded clothes and the fine Turkish carpet set over their table

The asymmetry of composition in Tintoretto's early self-portrait has given way here to physiognomical asymmetry. The hair on the artist's head, still thick, is smoother now, but the bushy beard seems to be wind-blown as if by the breath of Fate. The light, falling almost vertically from above, suggests a metaphysical reference, also reflected in the stillness of the picture: the lips seem to be seated beneath the silvery beard, and the ears are almost invisible too

20037-01samson.jpg	The emergence of previously unknown Italian-period pictures by Gerrit van Honthorst, two representing the Mocking of Christ (Private collection and Los Angeles County Museum of Art), and a third, Christ Crowned with Thorns (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles), has altered our view of the chronology of this Utrecht artist's early Roman production. It is now possible to suggest that Samson and Delilah should be dated as c. 1615. These new works help us to account for the rapid growth of Honthorst's reputation in Italy and his Italian nickname, 'Gherardo delle Notti'. Although the composition might be his initial response to such works as Caravaggio's Taking of Christ, Honthorst rarely repeated such compact arrangements of figures either in Rome or after he returned to the North.It is difficult to know exactly what encouraged or inspired Honthorst to specialise in the use of artificial light sources since the idea already appears fully developed in what must be one of his earliest pictures. Among the possible sources is Rubens's c. 1609 nocturnal Samson and Delilah, in which an unusually sensitive investigation of artificial light is introduced into a popular Old Testament story (Judges 16: 19). Also new is Rubens's moralising physiognomic contrast between Delilah and her accomplice, an old servant woman. Since Honthorst uses both elements, although set into a very different composition, he may have known Rubens's picture through Jacob Matham's c. 1613 engraving. In Rome, Honthorst must have been aware of candlelit works such as Adam Elsheimer's Judith Beheading Holofernes. Indeed, it is likely that he was already acquainted with Elsheimer's work since Hendrick Goudt had brought a number of them to Utrecht. It is also of some significance that Karel van Mander lavished praise upon a series of nocturnal passion scenes painted on slate by Jacopo Bassano that he had seen in Rome.One of the most striking elements in Samson and Delilah is Honthorst's utilisation of physiognomic contrasts. This device was popularised by Caravaggio in his Judith Beheading Holofernes, although without the moralising attitude which Rubens later added. For Caravaggio, the device was a way of accentuating Judith's beauty. Honthorst later used a similar contrast in his Tavern Scene with a Lute Player (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), in which the old woman appears for the first time as a procuress.

36729-atalanta.jpg	In the Boeotian version of the legend, followed by Ovid (Met. 10:560-707), Atalanta was an athletic huntress. Her way with her suitors was to challenge them to a race in which the loser was punished with death. She remained unbeaten and a virgin until Hippomenes (elsewhere named Melanion) took her on. As they ran he dropped three golden apples, given to him by Venus, and since Atalanta could not resist stopping to pick them up she lost the race.  They later made love in a temple of Cybele, which offended the goddess so much that she turned them both into lions.In the picture Atalanta is shown in the act of stooping to pick up an apple as Hippomenes overtakes her.

19043-gallery.jpg	In 1628 Willem van Haecht portrayed the art gallery of his employer Cornelis van der Geest, a wealthy Antwerp merchant. A grand chamber is populated with important people admiring important art. It records the 1615 visit of Archduke Albert (r. 1599-1621) and Archduchess Isabella (r. 1599-1633), co-regents of the Spanish Low Countries, to Van der Geest's townhouse adjacent to the river Scheldt. The picture pretends to be accurate, even if some of the assembled guest were absent that day and not all of the art was displayed in this single room. Nevertheless, the comprehensive collection encompassed everything from copies of famous ancient sculptures up to contemporary paintings by Rubens.With the publication of biographies of famous artists by Giorgio Vasari (2550 and 1568) in Florence and Karel van Mander (1604) in Haarlem, a consensus about which artists were historically significant began to emerge. Van Haecht's painting locates Northern Renaissance art, especially that of Antwerp, at the heart of this canon. For both Vasari and van Mander, Jan van Eyck, erroneously dubbed the 'inventor' of oil painting, was the first northern painter of international renown. His lost Lady at her Toilet, or a replica, hangs prominently on the right wall immediately above and intentionally related to the Hellenistic statue of Venus Pudica (Venus of Modesty). D�rer, already heralded as the greatest German artist, is represented by his engraving of the Standard Bearer (c. 1501) at the front of the centre table, and by his portrait wearing a black hat and cloak on the back wall. Given its context, the former may allude to D�rer's role as standard bearer and rallying figure in Northern Renaissance art. Tommaso Vincidor, Raphael's assistant, painted this now-lost likeness in 1520 during D�rer's stay in Antwerp. Around 1563 Van Eyck and D�rer were paired in bust sculptures attributed to Willem van der Broeck (Paludanus) on the house of painter Cornelis van Dalem in Antwerp.The history of Antwerp's artistic heritage begins with Quentin Massys. At the lower left, Van der Geest lectures on Massys's Virgin and Child, of which several versions exist. Standing beside the archduke is Rubens commenting on its merits. Behind, Van Dyck gestures toward the painting. Pictures by, or in the style of Massys, Pieter BBruegel the Elder, Cornelis van Dalem, Frans Floris and Pieter Aertsen, among other sixteenth-century Antwerp masters, are proudly displayed. The candelabrum is done in the style of Cornelis Floris.The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest testifies to the aesthetic preferences of a cultivated patrician whose collection was worthy of the attention of the Southern Netherlands rulers and leading artists. The composition reveals a growing historical consciousness. The noted Antwerp and Northern Renaissance masters are situated within the sweep of great European art. On the front table next to D�rer's engraving is a drawing Apelles Painting Campaspe in the Presence of Alexander the Great (1600) by Jan Wierix (1549-c. 1618). The gallery records the great Netherlandish heirs of Apelles. Indeed, Van Haecht, as painter and curator of the collection, plays Apelles to Van der Geest's Alexander.

16938-monfort.jpg	The most brilliant work from the early period of van der Goes is the Monforte Altarpiece, named after the town in which it was housed, in a college belonging to a group of Spanish Jesuits, before being subsequently transferred to the Berlin museum. It is a large-scale triptych, of which only the central panel, a long horizontal rectangle, has survived to the present day. A group of hovering angels have been amputated from the top of the panel, and the two wings have disappeared. The theme of the surviving picture is the adoration of the Magi.The Three Kings and their followers come upon the Virgin, the Holy Infant and Joseph amid the ruins of a palace. A group of villagers observe this extraordinary scene through a gap in the wall. The figures, both actors and witnesses, are all shown on the same scale, whether humble or magnificent. They are neither reticent nor exalted, but react to the event in their various ways, surprised or self-conscious. In the background we can see a few women, some cottages and a river besides which the Kings' horses are waiting. In the foreground, symbolic flowers - the lily and columbine - and a pottery vessel are depicted with great care. A tiny squirrel is running along one of the beams above the opening through which the villagers observe the scene. Van der Goes has given free rein to his imagination, both in the composition and in his handling of paint, deploying the splendidly rich colours that are so characteristic of his art, mixing blazing reds with the most delicately nuanced shades

00851-37_cruci.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 37 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The Crucifixion is depicted in seven cells in the corridor for lay brothers. While the friars and novices may have been moved to prayer at the thought or sight of the crucified Christ, the lay brothers required more direction in imagining the Passion. By incorporating more narrative elements, these images were able to prompt their devotion more efficaciously. In six cells Fra Angelico included the grieving Virgin and other mourners along with St Dominic or Peter martyr to cue the beholder's response. So it was in Cell 37, the large size of which suggests it may have served as the Chapter Room for the lay brothers as they met each day under the guidance of their own prior.The contribution of an assistant can be assumed in the execution of this fresco

31935-01visit.jpg	Like Andrea del Sarto and Rosso, early in his career Pontormo worked in the church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence where he executed the Visitation as part of the decorative cycle of the Scenes from the Life of the Virgin in the Chiostrino dei Voti.The painting depicts the meeting of Mary and her cousin Elizabeth, both with child, symbolically prefiguring the future interaction of their sons, Jesus and John the Baptist. Pontormo shows himself as under the spell of Raphael, arranging his composition on a set of low steps, similar to Raphael's School of Athens.

06221-doria.jpg	This painting of Andrea Doria, the Genoese condottiere who commanded the combined fleets of Venice, the Pope and the Emperor in their victory over the Turks, is a significant example of Bronzino's work as a portraitist of the aristocracy. Bronzino's more famous portraits of Lucrezia and Bartolomeo Panciatichi, Eleanora of Toledo and Laura Battiferri depict a class that was conscious of its nobility, set in immobile poses, with flawless alabaster skin and sumptuous clothes. In this painting, however, the allusion to ancient lineage had to be balanced by easily recognizable classicising elements, both in style and in the identification of the subject with the marine god. This explains the use of a pictorial repertory derived from Michelangelo as well as from the portraits of Doria by Bandinelli and by Sebastiano del Piombo

19174-53nogeor.jpg	Hals new tendency towards restraint is seen in the two large group portraits of civil guards made during the 1630s: the Officers and Sergeants of the St Hadrian Civic Guard of Haarlem (c. 1633) and the Officers and Sergeants of the St George Civic Guard Company (c. 1639), both in the Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem. The vivacity of the setting is already slightly subdued in the group portrait painted 1633 by the subordination of the figures to a horizontal band, and this horizontal accent completely dominates the arrangement of the figures in the group portrait painted 1639. In both group portraits the figures are set  in the open air, but they lose rather than gain in plein-air quality. This is particularly true of the picture of 1639, which is dominated by a warm golden olive tone, while the one of 1633 still retains a good deal of the colouristic vivacity and charm of the 1620s, and also some of the compositional boldness and agitation of the earlier period.The picture of 1639, in which Hals's self-portrait is to be seen, is the master's last representation of a civic guard group.

40172-sebastia.jpg	The cult of St Sebastian, who was probably a victim of Diocletian's persecution of the Christians, is documented in early Christian writings and has an unbroken tradition through to the 20th century. The scene Troger has chosen for his altarpiece refers to the legend that tells how Sebastian, Commander of the Praetorian Guard, was shot by archers on the orders of the emperor and later nursed back to health by the Christian Irene, widow of St Castulus the martyr. When he later continued to express his Christian faith, he was beaten to death,Troger's Sebastian is not the youthful hero of Baroque paintings. There is no radiant certainty of salvation here. Instead, we see a wretched scene of suffering that does not even have the historic pathos of a key event. What is happening here is shown in a shabby secluded setting, far from the public eye. With pragmatic energy, a young woman is untying him, while Irene gently draws an arrow from his body. The suffering of his martyrdom is as tangible as the suffering of any sick neighbour. The assistance is so pragmatic and utterly unheroic that the spectator perceives it as a natural action. In this way, Christianity is shown as a faith that can be applied to daily life

02859-procures.jpg	From the end of the 1620s paintings containing a clear allusion to sensuality and sexuality increased. Such allusions had been present in an embryonic stage in sixteenth-century Venetian painting. But the authors of these seventeenth-century paintings were not Italian - Italians were evidently inhibited by the Catholic Church's view of morality. Once Netherlandish artists returned to the Low Countries they developed a particular interest in scenes which combined seduction and music. The success of this combination is demonstrated by the sheer number of paintings that have survived.Baburen's painting is an example of this new genre, Honthorst's Procuress being another

36657-madonna.jpg	The experience of Italy was not only decisive for the majority of German landscape artists of the nineteenth century but also for figurative painting, secular as well as sacred. In 1818 Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld moved to Rome from his home town of Leipzig. There he joined the Lukas-Bund (Guild of St Luke), an artists' group originally set up by Friedrich Overbeck and Franz Pforr in Vienna in opposition to the academy there. After Overbeck and Pforr had moved to Rome the Lukas-Bund exercised great influence (though Pforr died in 1812), and not only on the German artists in Rome. The members of the group, called the 'Nazarenes' after their long hair like Christ's, wanted to return to what they saw as the simple truth and piety of D�rer and the early Italian Renaissance. They tried in their work to employ the forms, style and colour of the Old Masters. The composition and clear luminous colour of the Madonna and Child illustrates Schnorr's intensive, creative relationship with the Italian Renaissance

18743-guard208.jpg	Across the entire breadth of the painting stretches the smooth surface of the Lagoon. On the horizon the profile of an island is illuminated: Murano, as it appears from the eastern part of the Fondamenta Nuove, the quay on the northern side of Venice. Of the many belltowers visible on the island, a number have been pulled down in the meantime, as for instance that of San Maffio, on the far right; others, such as that of Santa Maria degli Angela on the far left, and that of San Pietro Martire, further toward the centre, still exist. To the left of Murano the island of San Cristoforo can just be discerned. The activity in the foreground, where many small figures are bustling about on unwieldy cargo boats, contrasts with the serenity of the background. Other figures are rowing smaller boats and in the middle an elegant gondola glides over the water; the passenger is almost entirely concealed by the boat's 'felze', or hood.The light is diffuse, as it often is on a warm day in Venice. A blue haze makes the humidity of the atmosphere, which is so characteristic of the island area, almost palpable. The contrast between the vaguely indicated topography on the horizon and the vertical slashes of the masts and sails of the boats in the foreground, rendered with more vigorous brush-strokes, lends the painting a special effect. The work has a companion representing Sant'Andrea, another island in the Venetian archipelago, important because of a sixteenth-century fortification situated there. Previously several of these Lagoon views were attributed to the virtually unknown Francesco Tironi, but nowadays they are considered climactic achievements in the oeuvre of Francesco Guardi.Compared with the San Cristoforo, San Michele and Murano from the Fondamenta Nuove (Kunsthaus, Zurich), where the precise, detailed manner of painting recalls Canaletto, the brushwork in this view of the Lagoon is looser and the effect of the atmosphere is much more pronounced. It is therefore certainly later, though assigning a precise date presents difficulties. Attention has been drawn to the relatively large size and curious proportions of the figures: the heads are much too small for the bodies. In the later work the figures become smaller. Therefore it seems reasonable to date the painting approximately 1765&#151;'70.It is not very likely that the atmosphere exuded by this particular canvas &#151; one of the most suggestive Guardi ever made &#151; would have been to the taste of English tourists, who were primarily interested in precise representations of Venice. Guardi's Lagoon scenes were rather intended for Venetian clients who were receptive to the picturesque qualities of their city and the surrounding watery landscape

09002-02pontmo.jpg	The picture, painted for a Parisian collector, is one of the rare works of Claude's maturity that depict and identifiable site.The best example of Claude's direct response to nature, although not topographically accurate, is the Landscape with Shepherds - the Ponte Molle of 1645 in the City Museum and Art Gallery, Birmingham. Each element in the picture is perfectly observed from nature; nothing is obviously artificial, but Claude arranged these elements - cabbage-like plants on the ground, classical ruins, a large pine tree - in a way which later generations came to regard as picturesque. To those unfamiliar with the actual landscape he painted, Claude's pictures seem even more artificial than they are. The Roman Campagna has changed little since the seventeenth century, especially the area around Tivoli; the terrain is dotted with the ruins of classical antiquity and there are numerous scattered pine trees which seem, especially when one is walking through them, to take on a `Claudian' aspect when juxtaposed with ruins. The light is marvelously clear, with the sky changing from blue to yellow in the morning and evening. Claude achieved a near perfect depiction of this atmosphere in the Birmingham picture : instead of the brilliant sunshine of the St Ursula there is a soft glow, in which the artist produces an almost milky light. He manages to capture atmosphere not by blurring the edges of each object depicted but by juxtaposing infinitesimal gradations of tone without losing the slightest detail. In all Claude's mature landscapes, and signally in this one, there is a sense of infinite distance in which the spectator can wander at will.The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 90)

43911-agrippin.jpg	The subject of this painting was taken from Roman history. Agrippina the Elder was a distinguished and prominent Roman woman of the first century AD. She was the wife of the general and statesman Germanicus and was granddaughter of Augustus, Rome's first emperor,.The scene shows the widowed Agrippina returning to Rome carrying the ashes of her assassinated husband, Germanicus. She is accompanied by her two young children, Caligula, the future emperor, and Agrippina the Younger, who was to be the mother of the Emperor Nero. Agrippina has placed herself and her children in certain danger by returning to confront the Emperor Tiberius, who was widely believed to have instigated Germanicus's murder. Germanicus's popularity as a general, as well as his wife's legendary virtue, draws large crowds of sympathizers to greet her when she disembarks at Brundisium.Painted for the Archbishop of York, this canvas led to King George III's lifelong patronage of West, despite the Pennsylvania-born artist's frank American patriotism

20362-06ingres.jpg	Angelica is the daughter of a king of Cathay in Orlando Furioso, by the Italian poet Ariosto (1474-1533), a romantic epic poem about the conflict between Christians and Saracens at  the time of Charlemagne. Angelica was loved by several  knights, Christian and pagan, among them the Christian hero Orlando (Roland). He was maddened (furioso) with grief and jealousy because she became the lover of, and eventually married, the Moor Modero. Roger (Ruggiero) freeing Angelica is a theme very like Perseus and Andromeda. Angelica chained to a rock by the seashore is about to be attacked by a sea-monster, the orc. Roger, one of the pagan champions, arrives riding on a hippogriff (a monster, the creation of the poets of the late middle ages). He dazzles the monster with his magic shield, and places a magic ring on Angelica's finger to protect her. He undoes her bonds and they ride off together.Ingres developed a highly sensitive aestheticism, particularly in depicting the beautiful naked body. He excelled his teachers in this, and it was here that he sought an ideal of form that goes to the limits of what can be done in painting. It is hard to find an equal anywhere in the history of art turned to us by The Grand Odalisque or the body of the young girl in Roger Freeing Angelica, modeled in soft lines.The position of the young Angelica, with her head tilted back, is highly exaggerated by modern standards, but the exposed and defenseless neck and the eyes cast up to suggest that she has fainted are intended to signalise pure feminine submission. In order to portray this unconditional surrender to her rescuer, Ingres has almost made her look as if she has a goitre. But this calculated submission to the aesthetic of the nude makes it no less erotic precisely because the very evidence of a weak spot in her beauty makes her seem less remote from the viewer

44163-defence.jpg	The artist had a distinguished career within royal circles, succeeding Sir Henry Raeburn as Limner to George IV for Scotland in 1823 and Sir Thomas Lawrence as Principal Painter to the king in 1830. He held this second post during the reigns of William IV and Queen Victoria.The Defence of Saragossa forms part of a group of four paintings purchased by George IV in 1829-30 and still in the Royal Collection. The other paintings are The Spanish Posada: a Guerilla Council of War, The Guerilla's Departure and The Guerilla's Return.The four paintings illustrate a decisive moment in the development of Wilkie's style. His early reputation had been based on genre pictures, mainly of scenes from Scottish life painted in the tradition of Teniers or Ostade, but an extended visit to the Continent in 1825-8, prompted by illness and the need for fresh inspiration, enabled the artist to study the works of major European painters, encouraging him to undertake more expansive historical subjects such as The Defence of Saragossa. Here the bolder composition - conceived on a larger scale - the vigorous handling and fresher colouring are clearly evident. These new aspects of Wilkie's style were derived from his attentive examination of works by Titian, Rubens, Vel�zquez and Murillo while on the Continent and particularly in Spain.The subjects of the four pictures were inspired by the Spanish insurrection against Napoleon's occupying force. The Spanish defiance of the French is a theme widely recorded in contemporary prose and poetry, partly as a result of the role played by the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular War of 1808-14. Of the paintings by Wilkie three are imaginary, but The Defence of Saragossa is based on a specific incident when the French laid siege to the city from June to August 1808. The composition depicts the Spanish guerilla leader, Don Jose Rebolado Palafox y Melci (1775-1847), and the Augustinian friar, Father Consolacion, who together have aimed the gun on the French column at the Convent of Santa Engracia, near the Portillo Gate. The moment shown is that when Agostina Zaragoza, the wife of the gunner dying in the lower left corner, seizes the lighted match and fires the gun at the encroaching forces. Wilkie was able to study the head of Palafox from life while he was in Madrid (Palafox was also painted by Goya [Madrid, Prado]). The priest, Boggiero, another hero of the Spanish resistance, is seen writing a dispatch on the left.Wilkie also discussed his ideas for these pictures with Delacroix in Paris on his return journey from Spain. Indeed, The Defence of Saragossa has been described by one writer as 'this country's answer to Delacroix's Liberty at the Barricades'. The heroine of the picture, known thenceforth as the Maid of Saragossa, became a celebrity in Europe, and Byron extols her heroism in the first canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (stanzas 54-9)

38954-041darius.jpg	In the 1740s, Tiepolo began a series of more than half a dozen decorative cycles in urban palaces and country villas. In 1743 he frescoed the two-storied salone in the centre of Carlo Cordellina's villa outside Vicenza. Cordellina, a lawyer, specialist in international jurisprudence, opted for two narratives of heads of state offering clemency to foreign prisoners, the Generosity of Scipio and the Family of Darius before Alexander. As in the past, Tiepolo turned to Veronese for ideas, choosing as a model for the Family of Darius the earlier master's famous depiction of the same subject. Tiepolo followed his predecessor in several ways, but since the Cordellina fresco is almost square in format rather than rectangular like Veronese's canvas, Tiepolo was compelled to rethink the subject's earlier artistic tradition.The Family of Darius, along with the equally successful Generosity of Scipio facing it, is one of Tiepolo's mature masterpieces. With their simple gestures, monumental spaciousness, and exquisite harmonies of colour, the pair of paintings convincingly portray deeply felt emotions that shine forth into the Cordellina salone, giving voice to the uniquely human virtue of magnanimity

Although his art can largely be classified as late neo-classicist, this time Mark� chose a romantic motif. He depicted the Puszta, the region of the country which is still thought to be the most special and the most interesting, with a sweep-pole well, its mandatory symbol. A rainbow glows in the stormy sky. One is reminded of the anxiety felt before a storm by the ponderous, dark clouds. Besides the subject of the painting, its style also shows the traits of romanticism, with special regards to its composition which is built on the contrast between light and dark

17131-arles53.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 569, JH 1623.Van Gogh painted four views of Les Alyscamps (to the south of Arles) in October-November 1888, during Gauguin's stay in Arles. The two earlier versions (F 568 and 569) are still in van Gogh's usual style. In these paintings of vertical format the painter takes up his position in the middle of the lane, with its ancient sarcophagi, relics of the time when Les Alyscamps had been the burial ground. The main subjects of the paintings are the trees.The next two versions (F 486 and 487) clearly betray the influence of Gauguin. The format is horizontal, and the position of the painter is changed moving from the centre to a point further off on the embankment, above the sarcophagi. The spatial qualities of the scene are obscured by the crisscrossing verticals of the tree trunks and the diagonals of the lane

30521-st_jerom.jpg	Patenier painted and signed his Landscape with St Jerome in about 1515. From a high vantage point, the eye is initially drawn to the foreground motifs, but then passes on stage by stage through an immense landscape, a spatial continuum that extends to the far horizon and narrow strip of sky. In the left foreground, in front of a soaring rock formation with a cavity that attracts the gaze, the saint is seated in front of a primitive shelter built up against the rock. He is concentrating on extracting a thorn from a lion's paw. In the distance, barely detectable, Patenier has depicted further legendary events in which the lion, St Jerome's companion, plays a role. Finally on the rocky plateau with monastery building, St Jerome forgives and blesses the repentant merchants who had stolen a donkey from him.With this painting the artist created a universal landscape, not because he depicted a particular panorama but because he went beyond the aspect of landscape to expound a view of the world, a comprehensive Christian view. The subjectivity of the visual experience that transforms a depiction of nature into a landscape compels the individual viewer to assume a very personal standpoint with respect to this implied world view

42995-1darius.jpg	The protagonists in this ancient story, painted for a palace of the Pisani family, wear a mixture of contemporary dress and fancy costume: the ermine collar and cape of the wives of Venetian doges, modern jousting armour and operatic Roman battle dress - anachronisms which have become identified with Veronese's Venice. The episode principally illustrates the magnanimity of Alexander the Great. Having defeated the Persian King Darius at Issus, Alexander spared his foe's mother, wife and children, sending word that Darius lived and that their royal persons would be respected. The following morning he went to visit them with Hephaestion, his dearest friend and general. When they entered the royal pavilion the Queen Mother, Sisygambis, prostrated herself in front of Hephaestion mistaking him for Alexander as he seemed the taller of the two. Hephaestion recoiled, an attendant corrected her, but Alexander himself courteously alleviated her embarrassment by saying, 'It is no mistake, for he too is an Alexander.' The gestures of Sisygambis and the courtier towards Darius' beautiful wife may refer to the secondary theme of the epoch-making 'continence' of Alexander, who abstained from claiming the Persian Queen as a concubine.The huge canvas must have been designed to hang above head height, for Veronese has deployed the figures - some of them surely family portraits - in three groups at the very edge of the picture, on a terrace in front of a thinly painted open colonnade

32812-39cowper.jpg	"The dominance of the lyrical and graceful aspect of this painting (known also as The Niccolini-Cowper Madonna) over the religious content mark it as belonging to Raphael's Florentine period, 1505-08. In fact this panel, signed and dated 1508, was executed near the end of Raphael's stay in Florence. The date 1508 and the artist's monogram ""RV"" have been worked into the embroidery of the Virgin's robe. The title derives from the names of two former owners.The full, well-formed figures reveal an early influence of Michelangelo, while the soft modeling and the use of chiaroscuro reveal the influence of Leonardo. Fra Bartolomeo's influence is particularly clear.The composition is extremely simple and essential; the gesture of the Child, who stretches his hand toward the Virgin while turning his attention toward the spectator, and the gesture with which the Virgin holds the hand to her breast, provide the only signs of life. The sentiment of anxious motherhood which, enriched by greater awareness, will be fully expressed in the Tempi Madonna, now in the Alte Pinakothek of Munich, appears here for the first time"

03739-miracl1.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezi�res, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them: we notice immediately the basic difference between the archaic choice of images, sometimes portrayed purely as a sort of inventory, offered by the older artists and the new, lively depictions of the city painted by Carpaccio.Gentile Bellini painted three of the teleri. The first is dated 1496 and represents the miraculous intervention of the Holy Cross in St Mark's Square on 25th April, 1444 on the occasion of the Feast of the Holy Cross. During the procession a merchant from Brescia by the name of Jacopo de' Salis knelt before the relic of the Holy Cross being carried by the members of the Confraternity and prayed that his dying son should be saved. The son recovered immediately.In the incomparable wide angle view the spectacle of St Mark's Square and the ceremony taking place unfold. On the left, the Procurate Vecchie are still the one-storey buildings there since the time of Doge Sebastiano Ziani (1172-1178); the Gothic buildings which lie beyond were demolished in the early sixteenth century to make way for the construction of the Clock Tower designed by Coducci. At the end of the square the Basilica of St Mark's still glows with the gold of the marble decorations and the Veneto-Byzantine mosaics of which only one that survives is the one above the arched doorway on the left. The Porta della Carta too stands splendid in its original gilded marble decorations, a brilliant caesura between the Basilica and the Palace of Doges. On the right, grouped around the base of the campanile stands the cluster of buildings including the Orseolo Hospice which was to be demolished in the sixteenth century so that the Procuratie Nuove could be built in its place as part of the plan for the Square produced by Jacopo Sansovino. The ancient buildings reflect the reddish bricks of the floor of the square which remained until Tirali changed them for the present grey slabs of stone patterned with white marble in 1723.The painter's attention was no less committed when reporting the procession. While the members of the government with the Doge at their head preceded by the standard-bearers, the trumpeters and the symbols of power, are level with the campanile, the members of the Confraternity stand out in the foreground, dressed in the white of the Scuola. In the middle of the group escorted by candle-bearers a canopy covers a golden 'soler' on which is carried the precious relic of the Holy Cross. Reality in the scene is treated faithfully and in minute detail and to encompass the whole event the perspective is widened artificially. In this 'mediaeval' canvas Gentile Bellini achieves a choral grandeur within which he fixes his portrait of men and buildings

35559-09philos.jpg	Portraits, including those in seventeenth-century Antwerp, were not just a mirror of the dominant ethical ideas of the time. They could also, in an equally subtle way, illustrate someone's intellectual role and significance. The group portrait known as the Four Philosophers, which shows Rubens with three humanists, his brother Philip, Johannes Woverius and the teacher of both of them, Justus Lipsius is a typical example. Emblematic details make it clear that Rubens has shown himself with the three humanists in order to express the underlying moral principles of Stoic philosophy, which were also those of the influential Lipsius and the other sitters. They are shown gathered together in homage to Seneca, one of the classical exponents of Stoicism, here represented by his bust. Finally, the ruins of the Palatine in the background show that the picture also pays homage to classical culture in the widest sense, symbolizing the resurrection in their own time of the departed glory of Hellenistic-Roman antiquity

35599-03landsc.jpg	This landscape display a realistic vision. Rubens not only painted the milkmaids and the cattle from preliminary drawings made from life. This piece of Brabant countryside is seen from a low viewpoint. It is noticeable that the peasant girls are painted larger than was usual for such additional figures in Flemish landscape painting. Depicted in the same sculptural style as the figures in contemporary history paintings, they are placed emphatically in the foreground. Moreover, they are approached sympathetically. The woman standing, carrying a basket on her head, is even painted in a very dignified pose, obviously based on the classical contrapposto. This explicitly positive approach to simple countryfolk is the more striking when it is remembered that in the genre painting the image of the peasant would continue to bear a pejorative accent until almost the middle of the seventeenth century

37143-insanewa.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Signorini showed an early interest in sociocritical writings and in French Positivism. This interest was also expressed in paintings that articulated his social concerns, such as the impressive Insane Ward at San Bonifacio's, Florence. When it was exhibited in Turin in 1870, the painting sparked violent controversy. Degas, a friend of Signorini since the latter's visit to Paris, responded enthusiastically to its close observation of real conditions

06505-01parabl.jpg	"It was only later that Bruegel's pictures received their titles; they have since undergone change in the course of the centuries, most of the works being known today under a number of names. That given this work - which is also known as The Fall of the Blind - refers to Christ's parable concerning the Pharisees (Matthew 15:14): ""And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.""In the parable of the blind leading the blind Christ was illustrating in readily appreciable physical form a spiritual condition &#151; inner blindness to true religion. Bruegel gives visual expression to Christ's words in this truly tragic image. The frieze-like procession of the large-scale figures of six blind men reaches an agonizing climax in the terrified expression of the second, who is falling. In contrast to this staggering line of humanity is the church behind them, strong and solid, representing the faith which gives true vision. Once again, in a late work, Bruegel gives a particular and realistic interpretation to a Christian moral.The blind were a subject of special fascination to Bruegel. He introduced a group into The Fight between Carnival and Lent and a drawing of 1562 in Berlin also shows a group of three blind people. Other paintings of the blind by Bruegel are mentioned in early inventories. His treatment of them is sympathetic without for a moment being patronizing"

He came to Venice in 1542 to be the prior of San Giovanni dei Forlani, which belonged to the Knights of Malta. The white cross on his cloak clearly shows that he is a member of the order. Only twelve years old, Ranuccio already possess the grave bearing of an adult. The way he is looking out to the left of the picture, and the slight turning of his body, makes him look as if he is about to move from the place where the artist has captured him on canvas. This movement contributes considerably to the impression of childlike freshness which the painting radiates.This portrait is important in the artist's career for it marks the beginning of Titian's long association with the Farnese family and especially with Pope Paul III

19661-p_rotto.jpg	At first sight De Heusch's painting seems to represent the Tiber with the so-called Ponte Rotto, the ruins of the ancient Pons Aemilius, as it appeared until the nineteenth century from the eastern bank of the river at the level of the Isola Tibertina. To this day there are still remains of the bridge in the river. On closer inspection, however, the topographical likeness is limited to the Ponte Rotto itself and the Roman church of San Salvatore de Pede Pontis behind the bridge. In reality the Tiber curves to the right at this point and in the bend one does not see the stump of a lonely tower but the small Temple of Vesta and the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, among others. The high mountain to the right behind the bridge is also imaginary, while the dome of St Peter's is actually located behind the spectator on the right.Though De Heusch has several Roman panoramas to his credit yet he preferred to paint idealized landscapes in the manner of Claude Lorrain and Caspar Dughet. He furnished them with ruins and other architectural elements borrowed from his sketches of views in Rome and its surroundings. Even if no preparatory drawing or sketch for the exhibited painting has been preserved, the work is an excellent example of such idealized landscapes

05175-cornar01.jpg	The Villa Cornaro was commissioned from Palladio by Giorgio Cornaro, a Venetian nobleman. The construction began in 1553, and in the following year the Cornaro family began living in the central portion, although the wings and the second story of the loggia had not yet been built. These were added later, during different periods, one beginning in 1569, and the other in 1588, the latter under the direction of Vincenzo Scamozzi.During the 1588 work phase, Scamozzi had Camillo Mariani create stucco statues for the central hall, depicting two renowned members of the Cornaro family, Caterina, queen of Cyprus, and her husband James II Lusignan. It was not until the early eighteenth century that Andrea Cornaro decided to provide the villa interiors with pictorial decoration. In 1716, he engaged Mattia Bortoloni to paint six rooms on the first floor and two small rooms on the second.The works on the first floor focus on episodes from the Old Testament, while those on the upper floor are derived from the New Testament. On the first floor, the small rooms to the left of the main hall are dedicated to the narration of the stories of Moses and King Solomon, while those to the right are reserved for episodes relating to Noah, Abraham, and Jacob. The images are extremely simplified in the presentation of the subject matter.The frescoes in the Villa Cornaro are Bortolini's first known works. The style of the fresco cycle is surprising, its originality distances it from any work the painter would create in the future

14719-12marsha.jpg	In the Rococo period all over Europe Watteau stood as symbol of a new gracefulness and ease: the proof that the painter can tackle apparently flippant subject-matter and yet be a great artist. Watteau's own attitude was soon to matter no longer; he represented something which he might not always have wished to be. His compositions exercised an influence which was perhaps sometimes hardly conscious. A Frenchified grace in genre subjects was attempted everywhere, even in England.The most personal response to Watteau is in Gainsborough, a great painter who yet seldom painted anything resembling a Watteau subject. Several of Gainsborough's early portraits show him utilizing Watteau's compositions for his sitters. But Gainsborough borrows more than a pose, as his later pictures confirm. It is freedom that exhales from his portraits: the freedom of nature and natural settings is allied to free handling, and the whole expresses the idiosyncratic character of his sitters, so relaxed and yet lively, just like Gainsborough's own nature. The painter who described himself in a letter to a patron as 'but a wild goose at best' was dearly Watteau's cousin, taking the same freedom for the artist as he expressed in his art, and conscious of being the odd man out in ordinary society. Gainsborough, if anyone, was the heir to Watteau's art, but he was not to turn to the 'fancy picture' until late in life; and there would have been little patronage for an English painter producing f&#234;tes galantes in preference to portraits

42825-01anthon.jpg	"Connected with Veronese's late output, the work has several times been ascribed to the artist's workshop on the grounds of the greater simplicity of the composition, wholly dominated by brownish tones. In fact the artist has taken an original approach to the composition with the sweeping seascape that characterizes the entire scenes; the gulf on the left is balanced on the right by the figures of the saint and the bystanders, arranged on parallel planes and along a diagonal that indicates the depth of the space in which they move. The Franciscan saint, holding the traditional white lily, is represented standing on a tongue of land, preaching and pointing at the sea, where we can see the fish that have risen to the surface to hear his words. Anthony towers over the others; the pose, expressing the passion of his oratory, recalls that of many of Veronese's figures. His gesture, which serves to articulate the downward slope of the scene toward the edge, is echoed by the figures seen from the back, both the one in the middle, in a Manneristic attitude, and that of the Oriental in the foreground. The figures wearing turbans - as was customary in the art of Venice - render the sacred content of the representation ""ecumenical."

32807-36lamuta.jpg	The female portrait known as The Mute Woman represents a return to the influence of Leonardo. It certainly comes from the Florentine environment, for it was given in trust to the National Gallery of the Marches by the Uffizi, where it had been stored for several hundred years. It was attributed to Raphael only recently. Leonardo inspires mainly the pose of the figure (whose characteristically crossed hands constitute a very clear reference to the Mona Lisa). The neatness of the large areas of colour which emerge in lighter tones from the near-black background, and the analytical treatment of the details of the woman's clothing are characteristic of Raphael. The dispersive effect of this attention to detail is fully compensated by the tones of colour - used here in a fairly limited range - which unify the composition as a whole

06565-panoram.jpg	Jan Brueghel the Elder was arguably the most important European artist to have painted on copper. Certainly he was one of the most prolific - approximately half of his oeuvre was painted on this support and the majority of these works are, like the present painting, landscapes.Brueghel depicts here an assortment of peasants, merchants and travellers set within a delicately rendered landscape, framed on the left by a forest and opening up on the right to a panoramic view of a distant city. The most striking feature of this landscape is the extraordinary sense of perspective that the artist creates within the composition, an accomplishment that is all the more remarkable given the small scale of the work

20718-bean_kng.jpg	Jordaens painted several versions of the subject, representing a popular custom, the feast of the Bean King.The composition of this version did not remain fixed from the beginning. Over some 15 or 20 years, the pictorial surface was extended with several strips of canvas, recognisable by the seams. In this way Jordaens made room for the two couples on the left, extrapolating from the boisterous merrymaking of the central group to illustrate two specific consequences of drinking alcohol. While the helpless old man embodies the vice of lethargy, the amorous frenzy of the younger exemplifies unchastity. But it is the dog in the foreground that really encapsulates the bad end the party is to come to. In less than a moment, the cutlery and glassware from the falling basket will hit the floor with a crash and a tinkle, startling the assembled guests.

35510-42mythol.jpg	The story, which has attracted not only artists but poets, including Shakespeare, tells that Adonis was the offspring of the incestuous union of King Cinyras of Paphos, in Cyprus, with his daughter Myrrha. His beauty was a byword. Venus conceived a helpless passion for him as a result of a chance graze she received from Cupid's arrow (Ovid: Metamorphoses). One day while out hunting Adonis was slain by a wild boar, an accident Venus had always dreaded. Hearing his dying groans as she flew overhead in her chariot, she came down to aid him but was too late. In the place where the earth was stained with Adonis' blood, anemones sprouted.Rubens depicts the scene when Adonis, spear in hand and with hunting dogs straining at the leash, is impatient to be off, while Venus imploringly tries to hold him back. But she pleads in vain. The painting is a variation on a picture painted by the master Rubens most revered: Titian. In Rubens' painting, Venus became the goddess by whom he himself now steered, Helena Fourment, while the fate of Adonis is implicit in the painting's elegiac tone. The nude Venus, grace- fully seated, begs Adonis to remain, gently coaxing the garment from his shoulder. She casts a beseeching glance at him, her anxiety translated in the disorder of her blonde tresses. The tanned and muscular Adonis is clothed in a dazzling red tunic prefiguring the flower that he is to become; he is the incarnation of a Greek statue, his body standing out against the luminous sky that Venus has abandoned for love of him. At his feet, a little Cupid pleadingly clasps one of his thighs; the presence of the god of love and his quiver evokes the first cause of this tragic encounter. But for the duration of the moment, it is love rather than tragedy that prevails. Thus Rubens transforms the Metamorphoses themselves into a symbol of marital love.Rubens was a devout Roman Catholic, yet his paintings while religious in theme were not influenced by the dogma of his era.  He interjected a lusty exuberance into his work rather than staying strictly to his academic, traditional forms. This painting was completed near the end of his life at a time when he struggled with arthritis almost daily

30417-rocca0.jpg	A small room (the Camerino) in the castle of Fontanellato contains a fascinating fresco decoration by Parmigianino. It depicts the famous story told by Ovid of the hunter Actaeon, who happened innocently to catch sight of Diana bathing, was transformed into a stag by the enraged goddess, and eventually killed by his own dogs.The Camerino has a vaulted ceiling with fourteen lunettes. The painter could not or did not wish to include the lower parts of the wall for the narrative painting. Parmigianino grappled with the problem of composing the narrative series in a series of drawings. He decided to transfer the action of the story from the ceiling to the lunettes. Thus it was possible to narrate the story in a logical manner using nearly life-size, half-length figures. A clear visual separation is maintained between the space in which the action takes place and the vaulted ceiling surrounded by a pergola.The picture shows a view of the entire decoration

44300-raphael.jpg	The lives of famous artists became a popular subject for painters during the nineteenth century. This was partly the result of a serious revival of historical interest that influenced the discipline of art history during the middle decades of the century, and partly the result of the Romantic preoccupation with the workings of artistic genius. Raphael was an obvious choice, since his undoubted success as a painter could be spiced with a rich variety of biographical details, including not only his dealings with powerful patrons but also his own personal relationships both as an infant prodigy and as a young man who died at the height of his creative powers.The particular episode of Raphael painting the Madonna delta Sedia seems to have a German origin. According to the legend, a hermit, on being attacked by a pack of wolves, escaped into the branches of a tree from which he was eventually rescued by a vintner's daughter. In gratitude the hermit prophesied that both the tree and the girl would be immortalised. After several years the daughter married and had two children. The tree was felled and its timber used for wine barrels. While walking through the countryside Raphael saw the young mother with her two children and, overcome by their beauty, felt impelled to paint them. On discovering that he had left his painting materials behind, he drew the group in chalk on the bottom of one of the wine barrels, thereby immortalising both the tree and the girl as the hermit prophesied. Wittmer has set the scene of his painting near Rome, since the Colosseum can be seen through the loggia on the left.Wittmer was born in northern Bavaria and trained as a goldsmith before entering the Academy in Munich in about 1820. He was a pupil of Johann Peter von Langer and Peter Cornelius, whom he assisted in painting the frescoes in the Glyptothek in about 1825. For several years he lived and worked in Italy (1828-32) before travelling in Sicily, Greece and Asia Minor. The main influences on his style were the Nazarene painters whom he met in Rome, namely Friedrich Overbeck and Johann Koch, whose daughter he married in 1838. He was essentially a history painter, but later in life he painted a number of altarpieces

25967-03crabb0.jpg	The Annunciation, a grisaille executed as a tableau vivant, exemplifies the artist's early style (c. 1467-70), which was still strongly reminiscent of Van der Weyden. The panels originally formed the rear of a pair of triptych wings, which were removed and separated from the paintings on the front. The original altarpiece showed the Crucifixion and was probably commissioned by Jan Crabbe, twenty-sixth abbot of the Abbey of the Dunes in Koksijde. The central panel is now on display in the Museo Civico in Vicenza, while the insides of the wings are in the The Morgan Library and Museum in New York. These panels had been moved to Germany during the occupation and were recovered in 1952. They have since been in the museum on permanent loan.The Annunciation is one of the earliest examples in the Low Countries of a `natural' or `living' grisaille with figures whose bodies are `coloured'

Despite her nickname, Juana's ""madness"" has often been disputed; she may have been locked up for political reasons only. Either way, she was a passionate woman, who fell madly in love with her handsome husband and continued to caress him even after his death. At the age of 16, Juana was betrothed to Philip the Handsome of Austria (1478-1506), only son of the Emperor Maximilian I, and they married in 1496 in the Low Countries"

11693-3adorati.jpg	Domenico returned to Florence from Perugia in 1439 and began to work on the frescoes of stories from the life of the Virgin in the church of Sant'Egidio inside the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. (The frescoes were destroyed in the 18th century.) The roundel of the Adoration of the Magi was probably painted during one of the intervals in the work on Sant'Egidio.This tondo shows very clearly to what extent Domenico had learnt the lesson of Gentile da Fabriano. In a similar way to the Strozzi Altarpiece, the traditional subject is depicted as a chivalric or courtly scene, crowded with characters wearing rich and elegant costumes, all described down to the smallest details. This detailed description, which is evident in the landscape as well, and the presence of hunting motifs are the result of the influence northern painting exerted on Domenico, especially through the works of Pisanello. And yet, some formal and compositional elements, such as the sculptural quality of the figures, their solidity and weight, and the accurate use of perspective, clearly prove that this painting is a work of the Renaissance. The Berlin tondo is one of the works that demonstrates most clearly the fundamental influences on Domenico's art

00809-altar_sm.jpg	This is the main painting of the altarpiece, called San Marco Altarpiece. It represents the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Angels and Saints, it was executed for the main altar of the church belonging to the Convent of San Marco and dedicated to the two medical saints, Cosmas and Damian. The altarpiece, one of the most grandiose of the Quattrocento altars,  was executed after the decision of Cosimo de' Medici in 1438 to transfer to Cortona the triptych which served as main altar of the convent church. It depicts, in the front, the kneeling Sts Cosmas and Damian, then in the second row, from the left: Sts Lawrence, John the Evangelist, Mark, Dominic, Francis and Peter the Martyr. It is assumed that the figure of St Cosmas is the likeness of Cosimo de' Medici. In the lower center a Crucifixion with golden background can be seen

36080-1view1.jpg	Cecchino del Salviati was entrusted by Cardinal Giovanni Ricci (1497-1574) to paint the hall in his newly acquired palace in the Via Giulia in Rome in 1552. In ten of the eleven rooms frescoed, mostly by little-known artists, the painting consists only of narrow wall friezes, some with themes from antiquity, some with themes from the Old Testament. By contrast, the hall, now known as the Sala dei Mappamundi and previously as the Sala dell'Udienza Invernale, received a significantly more elaborate decoration by the best available painter, Salviati.The general subject - the story of David as told in the first and second books of Samuel - was assigned to Salviati by Ricci, but in the choice of the individual scenes Salviati seems to have had great freedom.Salviati designed an original decorative system which dealt with the existing features of the room whose walls were irregularly divided by windows and doors. Above a high 'basamento' he painted an illusionistic high-columned hall on three of the walls which forms the supporting scaffold for a series of differently framed, large 'quadri riportati'. The decorative system gives the impression of being in a room in which an art lover is putting his treasures on display. The decoration is intended to show the wealth and fortune of its patron.The fifteen scenes of the story of David are not arranged in a chronological order, rather they are organized according to criteria of formal symmetry and thematic correspondences

14586-dianadog.jpg	Game still-lifes were closely connected with kitchen scenes and pantry motifs, of which they were in many ways a special form. While the social context of a kitchen is not always obvious and may be either the household of the landed gentry or the merchant patrician classes, the majority of early, large-format game still-lifes reflected the interests and spheres of royalty and nobility. The hunt as an aristocratic privilege had only just began to emerge at the beginning of early modern times. Hunts were captured in the form of large-scale panoramic paintings. Also there were numerous glorified transpositions of real hunting scenes into mythological ones. This painting shows an example of this approach.

Venice is enthroned on a cloud, ringed by a large number of deities representing her economic and political power, forming an opulent court of beautiful naked women and elegantly dressed lords.

39086-07agatha.jpg	This picture was painted c. 1756 for the high altar of the church of S. Agata in Lendinara. It must originally have been rounded at the top, for it appears in this form in an etching by Tiepolo's son, Giovanni Domenico. The part which is now missing showed a heart surrounded by the crown of thorns in a nimbus, at which the saint was gazing. The beautiful Agatha was a devout Christian who lived in Catania. She steadfastly refused to make sacrifice to the heathen gods. When she defied the threats of the Roman Governor of Sicily, Quintianus, he ordered her breasts to be cut off. We see her, half-naked, on a flight of steps; a maid kneels behind her, supporting her and holding her dress against the bleeding wounds. A page stands in front of a marble pillar, holding the severed breasts of the martyr on a silver platter and gazing down at her. The uncouth figure of the executioner, clad in red and holding a blood-stained sword, towers menacingly over the group.Tiepolo is among the last of the great Venetian painters, a master of large-scale composition, who was commissioned by princes outside (W�rzburg, Madrid) as well as inside Italy. Nor did he shrink from this particularly horrifying subject; once before, twenty years earlier, he had been required to treat the same subject for the church of S. Antonio in Padua. With astonishing self-assurance the painter succeeds in portraying this fearful episode in artistic terms without allowing it to degenerate into mere bloodshed and horror. At the same time, so strong is his desire for realism - and he had doubtless witnessed executions himself - that he exploits to the utmost the artistic possibilities open to him.In colour and form the composition is extremely accomplished, almost too much so to do justice to the theme. Between the soaring pillar and the towering figure of the executioner, one glimpses the dark entrance of the dungeon and beneath it the pale face of the martyr, flanked on both sides - almost oppressively close - by the faces of the two witnesses. The compassion expressed in the attitude of the young woman on the right contrasts with the searching glance of the page on the left, in which merely the physical effect of the scene before him is reflected. The wide, pale-blue cloak of the saint serves to bind the group of three figures together and blends with the silver-white, the bright yellow and the orange to produce a colour-harmony that is characteristic of Tiepolo. Two of the artist's crayon studies for the saint's face are in the Kupferstichkabinett (Copper Engravings section) in the Berlin Museum

03394-autumn.jpg	This painting is part of a series depicting the Four Seasons. They are derived from a series first designed by Jacopo Bassano around 1574. The series proved extremely popular and a number of versions were created within the Bassano family workshop. Francesco continued to produce the scenes in the later 1570s and 1580s. In Autumn, the rich abundance of the harvest is illustrated. On the far left of the composition, Moses receives the two stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. This was a popular iconography during the Renaissance and it was not unusual to include the detail within a larger genre scene such as the harvest.

26612-03_5ne.jpg	The picture shows the Ignudo at the lower right corner of the Sacrifice of Noah (above the prophet Isaiah).The ignudi in the third bay are painted with greater fluency and the modeling is more delicate - with greater attention being paid to the reflections and the subtle effects of light and shade - than those of the first bay. Moreover, their poses are no longer wholly symmetrical. In fact, in the two figures on the left, only the lower part of the body is symmetrical, while the twisting of the bust and the head are expressions of contrapposto. The right arms of both are, however, extended toward the centre in order to hold the ribbon supporting the medallion.

13061-boardman.jpg	Ralph Earl was one of the foremost American painters of the late 18th century. Elijah Boardman was a prosperous textile merchant who fought in the Revolutionary War and eventually became a United States senator. Earl has provided clues to the background and personality of the sitter by posing him in a room of his dry-goods store at a stand-up desk and bookcase. The horizontal and vertical patterns created by the bolts of cloth and the books enliven the picture. This and other Connecticut portraits represent the finest period of Earl's work, blending a straightforward realism with the polished grace that the artist acquired during his years abroad

12300-23castel.jpg	The painting was executed together with Duccio's master, Cimabue. The master-pupil relationship was established very early on, when the first scaffolding for the frescoes had already been erected in the Upper Church of San Francesco, and it ended during the time of closest collaboration, around 1283-84 when work had got as far as the vault of the Doctors. These are the most likely stages of their association: the Angel on the splay of the big window of the north transept in the Upper Church at Assisi, the Madonna in the Church of the Servites in Bologna, the Madonna Gualino in the Galleria Sabauda in Turin, the Madonna of Castelfiorentino, the Crucifix in the Odescalchi Collection, the Madonna in the Museo d'Arte Sacra of the Val d'Arbia in Buonconvento, the Crevole Madonna in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Siena, the Expulsion of the Forefathers and the Crucifixion in the third bay of the south wall of the Franciscan Basilica, two of the Winged Genii which occupy the four corners of the vault of the Doctors in Assisi.Executed in a time-span of little more than five years, the paintings show strong stylistic affinities. In some cases (the Madonna in Bologna and the Madonna in Castelfiorentino) the painters seem to have achieved a real joint effort: the earlier style of the conception of these paintings suggests that the plan was Cimabue's, while the luminous treatment of colour implies that Duccio executed the work

They testified several times together as witnesses in lawsuits. They produced ten collaborative paintings, dating between 1644 and 1653.

17763-414goya.jpg	The inscription: LAM/DESCO (L�mpara descomunal, 'extraordinary lamp') identifies the subject as a scene from El hechizado por fuerza ('The man bewitched by force'), a play by Antonio de Zamora. The protagonist, Don Claudio, is led to believe that he is bewitched and that his life depends on keeping a lamp alight. The play was first performed in 1698 and reprinted several times, including 1795, shortly before Goya's painting. Goya has represented the scene as a theatrical performance, on a stage with the dancing donkeys as a backcloth (in the play they are described as paintings on a wall). The goat that appears to hold a lamp is no more than a stage property but the fear that it inspires in Don Claudio is portrayed with dramatic realism.This was one of six pictures of witches and devils painted by Goya for the Alameda of the Duke and Duchess of Osuna and paid for in 1798. The subjects are similar to scenes of witchcraft in Los Caprichos on which Goya was working at this time

The episode takes place at the time of Diocletian and the early Christian martyrs. After several unsuccessful attempts to eliminate Euphemia, who did not wish to abjure her Christian faith, she was thrown ""into a pit where there were three wild beasts so ferocious that they would swallow any man"", but amazingly they did her no harm. An executioner was then sent to drive ""his sword into Euphemia's side, thus making her a martyr for Christ. To reward the headsman for his service, the judge draped him in a silk garment and girded him with a gold belt, but as the man went out, he was snatched by a lion and devoured by the same"".Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, this painting was attributed to Titian or Veronese"

20331-hollyhoc.jpg	Dutch painters described the visible world with remarkable precision and one of the forms this description took was the still life. In the earliest years of the seventieth century still lifes often had a vanitas element. Among the apparently random accumulation of objects were clocks, snuffed-out candles, faded flowers and skulls, reminders of the passage of time and the inevitability of death and decay. As the century progressed these elements dropped away and still-lifes became simply displays of the rare, exotic, expensive and beautiful.Jan van Huysum, whose career spanned the first half of the eighteenth century, was the heir to this great tradition of still-life painting and, as far as floral still lifes are concerned, its greatest exponent. This painting is undated but must belong to the first half of his career before about 1720, when he began to paint more elaborate and artificial flower pieces, which are light in tone on light backgrounds, in an almost pastel palette. It probably dates from about 1710.Jan van Huysum lived and worked in Amsterdam. He was one of a dynasty of painters, having been trained by his father Justus van Huysum, also a still-life painter, and was later imitated by his younger brother, Jacob.

15020-marque03.jpg	In 1901, when he painted this work, Gauguin finally left Tahiti to go to Hiva Oa in the Marquesas. On his arrival, he began building his 'House of Pleasure' in the town of Atuona, and his output decreased significantly at this time. Much of what he produced was reworkings of old themes, and Woman and Two Children resuscitates the motif of the seated female figure that Gauguin had used in Paris when he painted Annah the Javanese, and to which he was to return the following year in Woman with a Fan. In both these works the figures are strangely isolated in space, staring impassively forward with the static quality and crisply delineated shadows that suggest a photographic source

05600-130nativi.jpg	There is no documentary evidence to prove whether or not Botticelli was one of Savonarola's follower. But certain themes in his later works - like the Mystic Nativity - are certainly derived from the sermons of Savonarola, which means that the artist was definitely attracted by that personality so central to the cultural and political events of Florence during the last years of the fifteenth century.It has been suggested that this picture, the only surviving work signed by Botticelli, was painted for his own private devotions, or for someone close to him. It is certainly unconventional, and does not simply represent the traditional events of the birth of Jesus and the adoration of the shepherds and the Magi or Wise Men. Rather it is a vision of these events inspired by the prophecies in the Revelation of Saint John. Botticelli has underlined the non-realism of the picture by including Latin and Greek texts, and by adopting the conventions of medieval art, such as discrepancies in scale, for symbolic ends. The Virgin Mary, adoring a gigantic infant Jesus, is so large that were she to stand she could not fit under the thatch roof of the stable. They are, of course, the holiest and the most important persons in the painting.The angels carry olive branches, which two of them have presented to the men they embrace in the foreground. These men, as well as the presumed shepherds in their short hooded garments on the right and the long-gowned Magi on the left, are all crowned with olive, an emblem of peace. The scrolls wound about the branches in the foreground, combined with some of those held by the angels dancing in the sky, read: 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men' (Luke 2:14). As angels and men move ever closer, from right to left, to embrace, little devils scatter into holes in the ground. The scrolls held by the angels pointing to the crib once read: `Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world' the words of John the Baptist presenting Christ (John 1:29). Above the stable roof the sky has opened to reveal the golden light of paradise. Golden crowns hang down from the dancing angels' olive branches. Most of their scrolls celebrate Mary: 'Mother of God', 'Bride of God', 'Sole Queen of the World'.The puzzling Greek inscription at the top of the picture has been translated: 'I Sandro made this picture at the conclusion of the year 1500 in the troubles of Italy in the half time after the time according to the 11th chapter of Saint John in the second woe of the Apocalypse during the loosing of the devil for three and a half years then he will be chained in the 12th chapter and we shall see [...] as in this picture.' The missing words may have been 'him burying himself'. The 'half time after the time' has been generally understood as a year and a half earlier, that is, in 1498, when the French invaded Italy, but it may mean a half millennium (500 years) after a millennium (1000 years): 1500, the date of the painting. Like the end of the millennium in the year 1000, the end of the half millennium in 1500 also seemed to many people to herald the Second Coming of Christ, prophesied in Revelation.At a time when Florentine painters were recreating nature with their brush, Botticelli freely acknowledged the artificiality of art. In the pagan Venus and Mars he turned his back on naturalism in order to express ideal beauty. In the 'Mystic Nativity' he went further, beyond the old-fashioned to the archaic, to express spiritual truths - rather like the Victorians who were to rediscover him in the nineteenth century, and who associated the Gothic style with an 'Age of Faith'.

15924-tempest.jpg	"It was already in 1530 described simply as ""the little landscape on canvas with a tempest, a gypsy woman and a soldier..."" This painting, the meaning of which has been greatly debated, marks a moment of capital importance in the renovation of the Venetian style painting, and perhaps is the most representative of the very few genuine surviving works of Giorgione.The vigour of cultural life at the beginning of the sixteenth century provided exactly the right fertile ground for the personality of Giorgione. With Giovanni Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio as examples in his early training and with his attentive interest in Northern European painting of Belgium he soon decided to attempt a naturalistic language. Colour attains to new all-important powers of expression of the poetic equivalence of man and nature in a single, fearful apprehension of the cosmos. The finest of all expressions of this new vision of the world is the 'Tempest', commissioned from the artist by Gabriele Vendramin, one of the leading lights in intellectual circles in the Venice of the day, in whose house the picture was recorded as having been hung by Marcantonio Michiel in 1530.Though many interpretations of the subject of this small painting have been suggested, none of them is totally convincing. Thus the mystery remains of what exactly the significance is of the fascinating landscape caught at this particular atmospheric moment, the breaking of a storm. Anxious waiting seems to characterize the mood of both the human figures, absorbed in private reveries, and every other detail, from the little town half-hidden behind the luxuriant vegetation and the lazy, tortuous course of the stream to the ancient ruins, the houses, the towers and the buildings in the distance which pale against the blue of the sky. The fascination of the painting arises from the pictorial realization of the illustrative elements. In the vibrant brightness which immediately precedes the breaking of the storm the chromatic values follow one another in fluid gradations achieved by the modulation of the tones in the fused dialectic of light and shadow in an airy perspective of atmospheric value within a definite space. Completely liberated from any subjection to drawing or perspective, colour is the dominant value in a new spacial-atmospheric synthesis which is fundamental to the art of painting in its modern sense"

08687-11brioch.jpg	Chardin ranks as one of the forerunners of modern painting. Volumes and empty spaces stand in a reciprocal relationship within his compositions. There is a magical quality to the mutual self-definition of the assembled objects, each of which possesses its own field of tension and individual aura. Chardin succeeds in lending objects an emotional dimension, in animating them, without stripping them of their concrete tangibility His achievement consists of enriching a painting based on art and tradition with everyday experience, actualised thanks to direct observation from nature.

23418-thomas1.jpg	This panel, together with three others also in the Edinburgh museum and a fifth in the Vatican formed the predella of an altarpiece.

While critics are divided about the respective roles of the two painters in designing and executing the principal panels of the triptych, this does not extend to the predella by Luca di Tomm�.The predella panels illustrate the less familiar story of St Thomas's sea journey to southern India, his foundation of a Christian church there, and his eventual martyrdom.

17535-2hercul.jpg	"The subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. On a journey, Hercules and Deianira came to a river where the centaur Nessus was the ferryman. While carrying Deianira across he attempted to ravish her. Hercules, already on the further bank, drew his bow and slew Nessus. The centaur, knowing that his blood was now poisoned with the hydra's gall from Hercules's arrow, cunningly told Deianira with his dying words to collect it, as it would one day serve as a love-potion. While Hercules was away in distant parts, Deianira, at home in Trachis, learned that he was courting another woman, Iola. She sent a messenger to him with a gift, the tunic smeared with Nessus ""love-potion,"" that was poisoned. When Hercules put it on the poison began to corrode his flesh which led to his death.Gossart's painting shows the couple in happier time, their interlocking legs a sign of conjugal bliss. With mouths slightly open in a sigh, they stare lovingly into each other's eyes. They sit in a marble-paneled niche, the panels below showing a selection of scenes from the life of Hercules. Deianira sits on the tunic that will later cause his demise.The beautifully composed crossed legs of the couple, and in particular the pose of Deianira, were in part inspired by Jacopo de' Barbari's engraving of Cleopatra. Gossart seems to have followed even more closely the model of Jacopo Ripanda's Neptune and Amphitrite figures"

15874-medici01.jpg	The Palazzo Medici (later Medici Riccardi) was the symbol of the economic power of the Medicis who were the virtual lords of Florence in the 16th-17th centuries. In 1659 Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), the Grand Duke of Tuscany, sold his family's venerable and imposing palace, built by Michelozzo in the fifteenth century, to Gabriello Riccardi (1606-1675) and his nephew Francesco Riccardi (1648-1719). The Riccardi family had moved to Florence from Cologne in the fourteenth century, and in the sixteenth century attained great wealth from banking and commerce.A number of architects contributed to the remodeling of the palace which took thirty years. The most spectacular intervention into the original fabric was the construction, beginning in 1670, an east-west gallery wing. In 1676 the library was built directly beside the gallery. In 1684-89 another new wing was built to the north.The new owners' pride in the tradition-rich history of their palace is expressed in the painted decoration of the newly created rooms.In the Great Hall of the building, called the Gallery, the ceiling was covered by frescoes in 1683-85 by the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano, in order to show off the glories of the Medici family. Baroque civilization entered Florence with Pietro da Cortona in Palazzo Pitti and with Luca Giordano in Palazzo Medici Riccardi (1683-85)

32816-42ester.jpg	Raphael set his sublime and beautiful Madonnas among idealized green landscapes, as on this marvellously fine small panel now in Budapest, which was painted at the beginning of his Rome period. The unfinished nature of the work enables the viewer to catch a glimpse of the process of creation. The idyllic atmosphere of the landscape with Roman architectural motifs complement the harmonious juxtaposition of the figures and the colours. The painting was presented as a gift to the wife of Emperor Charles III by Pope Clement XI. Later, possibly as a gift from Empress Maria Theresa, it passed into the possession of Prince Kaunitz, and from him, in the eighteenth century, to the collection of Prince Esterh�zy - hence its name, the Esterh�zy Madonna. Numerous contemporary reproductions vouch for its popularity. The preparatory sketch is in the Uffizi collection

41738-3agapit1.jpg	Two double-sided panels, one depicting scenes from the life of St Agapitus of Praeneste, and another depicting scenes from the life of St Remigius (Remi), bishop of Reims, must originally have formed the folding wings of an altarpiece. The lost altarpiece probably had another pair of folding wings.St Agapitus is a third-century martyr saint. According to his legend, 15-year-old Agapitus, who may have been a member of the noble Anicia family of Praeneste (modern Palestrina), was condemned to death, under the prefect Antiochus and the emperor Aurelian, for being a Christian. He was thrown to the wild animals in the local arena at Praeneste. The beasts refused to harm him, and he was beheaded.One side of the Agapitus panel shows the saint seated in a walled enclosure, surrounded by lions and bears. His persecutors observe from the balcony at the upper right. The saint's beheading outside the walls of Praeneste appears on the other side of the panels.Comparison with other existing panels from workshops in northern Switzerland indicates that the panels were originated in that region

04134-damsquar.jpg	Gerrit Berckheyde is at his best in his speciality: paintings of a major building, squares, a row of houses or other segments of a city. He is usually robust and above the average in pictorial sensitiveness. But he can be repetitive: there exist more than a dozen autograph versions of the view of Haarlem's main square, with slight variations in the point of view and field of vision.The demand for views of Amsterdam (but not for the interiors of its churches), was far greater than for portrayals of Haarlem, and Gerrit did his share to satisfy it. He never settled in the metropolis; following studio practice of the time, he made the easy trip from Haarlem to Amsterdam where he sketched preparatory drawings and returned to his studio to work them up into finished paintings. His earliest view of the new town hall on the Dam bears an autograph inscription stating it was painted at Haarlem in 1668 (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp). During the following three decades Gerrit virtually made a career of depicting the town hall, a symbol of Amsterdam's pride, prestige, and prosperity, from various viewpoints and in different lighting conditions. He also painted five different versions of its side and rear fa�ade flanking a canal that had a flower market on its bank

42358-winter_l.jpg	In 1612 two landscape artists, Hercules Seghers and Esaias van de Velde joined the painters' guild in Haarlem, and it is from that year that the origins of realistic landscape painting in the north Netherlands can be dated. Esaias was born in Amsterdam in about 1590 and probably trained in the studio of Gillis van Coninxloo, an Antwerp landscape painter and follower of Pieter Bruegel the Elder; who had fled to the north as a Protestant refugee from the war in Flanders. Esaias van de Velde developed Coninxloo's style in the direction of greater realism.As can be seen in this small panel of 1623, his mature style is characterized by a striking naturalism created by free brushwork and a deliberately restricted palette. The mannerisms of Flemish landscape have disappeared to leave an image which conveys all the crispness of an icy winter day in Holland. The figures are sketched in sure, quick strokes, the landscape evoked in pigments thinly scraped across the still-visible gesso ground. Van de Velde also studied the work of Adam Elsheimer, the German painter who moved to Rome in the first decade of the seventeenth century. Esaias would have known Elsheimer's paintings in the form of prints and it is from them that he derives his low viewpoint and the triangular composition.At the same time as the powerful and naturalistic landscapes of Seghers and Esaias van de Velde were being created in Haarlem, Esaias's cousin, Jan van de Velde, was at work in the town engraving his delicate landscapes, and Cornelis Vroom was creating his understated but remarkably innovative paintings and prints based on the countryside around the town. Among Esaias's pupils was Jan van Goyen who was further to develop and refine his master's style.

20808-1lastsup.jpg	During the second third of the sixteenth century, a number of Spanish painters fell heavily under the influence of Raphael. Typical in this respect, in Valencia, are the members of the Masip family: Vicente Masip and his son Juan Juanes (Vicente Juan Masip). The work of the latter, mostly later than 1550, is distinguished by a certain formalistic elaboration of the directions taken by his father, and is by no means lacking in grace or skill. Juan de Juanes was the creator of a group of models of Spanish piety. His work is harmonious, rythmically transparent and well designed. These characteristics are particularly evident in his more popular compositions, such as the Holy Family in the Academy of San Fernando, the Redeemer in Valencia, and the Last Supper in the Prado

05200-12carry.jpg	In the Christ Carrying the Cross, the head of Christ is silhouetted against a dense mass of grimacing soldiers and ill-wishers, one of them bearing the familiar toad on his shield. Christ's physical agony is heightened by the spike-studded wooden blocks which dangle fore and aft from his waist, lacerating his feet and ankles with every step. This cruel device was frequently represented by Dutch artists well into the sixteenth century. The high horizon is old-fashioned, as is the lack of spatial recession in the middle distance. In the foreground, soldiers torment the bad thief while the good thief kneels before a priest. The almost frantic intensity of his confession, well-expressed by the open-mouthed profile, contrasts vividly with the passive response of the priest who seems to suppress a yawn. The very presence of the priest is, of course, an anachronism, probably inspired by what Bosch had witnessed at contemporary executions; the same motif appears in the great multi-figure Christ Carrying the Cross which Pieter Bruegel the Elder was to paint almost a century later

04941-virgchil.jpg	Of all Leonardo's pupils and followers it is Boltraffio whose work is most clearly related to that of the master in style. He is recorded as having worked for some years after 1491 in Leonardo's studio in Milan, and in his own works he often made use of compositions, sketches and drawings by the master - to whom more than one of his pictures has at some time been attributed. At the beginning of the last century this half-length Madonna in Budapest was so attributed and it certainly shows an unmistakably close link with Leonardo, the surviving series of whose drawings demonstrate that he was occupied with the idea of a composition in which the infant Jesus stretches his arms towards flowers in a vase. Nor is it only in the type of picture that the Budapest Madonna is related to  Leonardo. The subtlety of the detail, for instance the beauty of Mary's hands, the tender pose of the heads and the accomplished execution of the rich drapery, all provide evidence that the link with Leonardo is more than a matter of inspiration or borrowing of motifs. It is even believed that the master himself made some contribution to the work

The scene takes place in a desolate landscape of sharp crags which rise up from a deserted plain.The style is characteristic of Ferrarese painting, which was influenced by Mantegna and Piero della Francesca.

Behind the green alpine meadow and its calm pastoral air, however, we plunge suddenly down onto a patchwork plain of almost infinite extension - a quilt of palest blue and khaki, merging with the feathery sky, and painted with an atmospheric touch so delicate and limpid that it challenges the work of his great Venetian contemporaries

39813-11milita.jpg	In the latter part of his career Titian continued to give much care to portraits, though painting fewer. The most flamboyant is the Portrait of a Man in Military Costume dateable to the early 1550s. He is portrayed so theatrically that it is hard to take him seriously. Titian only adopted the full-length format for clients of the highest rank and surprisingly in so swagger an image the sitter has escaped identification. His outfit also needs to be better understood since it seems halfway between a military and a hunting costume.The identity of the subject of this life-size painting is unknown, probably it represents Ferrante Gonzaga (1507-1557), a successful commander under Charles V and later viceroy of Sicily and governor of Milan. The Cupid fiddling with his magnificently decorated helmet sets the portrait in an allegorical-mythical context

03816-099jerom.jpg	Formerly the painting was attributed to Basaiti, but now it is accepted as the work of Bellini			
30517-landscap.jpg	The painting offers us a bird's eye view of a vast imaginary landscape, dominated by a calm sky. At the centre, a gathering of people is listening attentively to John the Baptist, bending on a simple branch which is serving as a pulpit. To the left is a rocky mass, to the right a river winds its way into the horizon. The subtle succession of brown, green and blue planes creates the effect of an infinite perspective.This delicate work is from the hand of Joachim Patenier, originally from the Namur region, but who settled in Antwerp, where he was registered as a master of the Guild of St Luke in 1515. The artist appears to have been first and foremost a landscape painter. It is as such that he was described during his lifetime by his colleague and friend D�rer, who came to Antwerp in 1520. Whilst Patenier was probably not the first specialist landscape painter, he certainly contributed decisively to reversing the formal relationship between landscapes and human figures. His composite panoramas, which appear to embrace the entire earth, have received the German name of Weltlandschaften (world landscapes). But we must not be mistaken: these are devotional images where both the landscape and the human figures - however small - play a vital role.According to the biblical account, John the Baptist, after receiving the word of God in the desert, preached a gospel of repentance and the coming of the Messiah. Christian art was to locate this preaching in the woods, as here. The river probably represents the Jordan: on the left bank is depicted the baptism of Christ. The Saviour appears a second time, walking towards the sermon. Several natural elements clearly contain an allegorical dimension: the dying tree in the foreground, with a vine twined round it, probably symbolises the Tree of Knowledge which, according to the legend, withered after Adam and Eve's disobedience, but began to flower again once Christ had redeemed the world's sins. The vine is a motif of faithfulness and immortality, but in this context could refer to the tree of life, that is to Jesus himself

We know of documents, telling of paintings that have since been destroyed, that Botticelli was greatly in demand as a master of fresco paintings during the last three decades of the Quattrocento. He painted for the Vespucci family the St Augustine in the church of Ognissanti. It was created in competition with Ghirlandaio's fresco of St Jerome.St Augustine has been interrupted at his studies. He is deeply moved as he raises his eyes, and, in an expansive gesture, lays his right hand to his chest: for he is seeing a vision of the death of St Jerome.The entablature at the top is an architectural feature which Botticelli continued into the depth of the picture, in order to place a row of large books and astronomical instruments on it.

42224-0210vela.jpg	"Vel�zquez painted this picture of Bacchus surrounded by eight drinkers for Philip IV who hung it in his summer bedroom. The painting is not only unique in his oeuvre, but is very rare indeed in Spanish painting as a whole, which does not generally have the drinking scenes so familiar in Flemish and Netherlandish painting. Drunkenness was regarded in Spain as a contemptible vice and ""borracho"" (drunkard) was the most scathing of insults. At the royal court, it seems to have been considered highly entertaining to invite low-lifers from the comedy theatres and inebriate them for the amusement of the ladies. But what kind of a Wine God is this we see, crowning his followers with ivy, said to cool the heat of wine, and consorting with peasants who grin out of the painting and clearly find the spectator, that is to say the king, a very funny sight indeed? The authority of the god whose presence delights them lends them a sense of majesty as well. And in view of the delightful travesty of royal honours in which Bacchus is indulging, they too have turned the tables and are laughing in the faces of those who would laugh at them.As only Caravaggio before him, Vel�zquez has portrayed Bacchus (or rather Dionysos) as the God of the mask, the theatre and disguise.It was thought in the nineteenth century that this was a realistic scene showing a country festival, and the picture was given the title The Topers. The painting was damaged in the fire that destroyed the royal palace in Madrid in 1734, and the left half of the god's face has been much restored"

04020-cremona.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave. While he was working on the frescoes above the third and fourth arches, Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch since 1515. The compositions of his Adoration of the Magi and Presentation in the Temple draw on D�rer's woodcuts on the same themes. He competed with his northern model in the earthy details Physiognomies are exaggerated; dogs trot out. He applies quotidian, harsh effects.Bembo was not awarded another commission in Cremona Cathedral, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists

03813-097dead.jpg	This panel was centrally placed in the uppermost register of a polyptych. It shares the new stoicism  of the painter's brother-in-law Andrea Mantegna; both artists were inspired by the sculptural force of Donatello, who was long resident in nearby Padua.Among Bellini's favourite themes, to which he returned again and again, were the representations of the Madonna and the Lamentation in which the figure is shown half-length - a treatment already accorded the subject by Donatello. It provided the artist with the opportunity to combine a careful and subtle study of the nude with an expression of muted pain. Here Bellini succeeded in giving visual expression to new spiritual realms which no one before him had made manifest.Two angels are supporting the naked body of the crucified Christ, who is sinking back from a sitting position. Each holds the dead man's arm with one hand, while their faces lean gently against his head. Bellini had previously executed two paintings on the same theme; one is now in the Pinacoteca Comunale, Rimini, the other in the National Gallery in London. In the first of these, which is in a landscape format, there are four angels. This rather too fanciful interpretation was abandoned in the London picture, which - making the most of the upright format - shows Christ with only two angels. It was not until he painted the picture now in Berlin that Bellini succeeded in achieving a composition which has the balance in a classical sense, and in which the natural beauty of the human body is completely in harmony with the spiritual content of the subject. At the same time, the graphic structure of the picture with its soft yet vigorous contours loses none of its prominence, and in this the likeness to the art of Mantegna is unmistakable. It is hardly surprising that precisely this style should have deeply impressed Albrecht D�rer, the draughtsman, and that, during his visit to Venice, he wrote of Bellini that he was 'still the best of all painters'

19861-2guildf1.jpg	Sir Henry Guildford (1489-1532), two years older than Henry VIII, was a great favourite of the King, ending his career at court as Comptroller of the Royal Household, whose baton of office he holds. He also wears the Order of the Garter, awarded him in 1526. Possibly the pictures of him and his wife were commissioned for this occasion, because the panels were completed the following year. (The dating is definite, as the matching portrait of Lady Guildford is dated to 1527.He was a strong proponent of religious reform.)In comparison with the preparatory drawing held at Windsor, the sitter appears sterner and more conscious of office; worldly power emanates from his bulky figure, which swamps the background in the way Henry himself was also to do.Sensitive though the modelling and shading of the face are, they reveal less empathy than is evident in the portrait of More. A trace of latent tension or paranoia, akin to that felt in Florentine Mannerist works gives an edgy quality to the apparently self assured form, enhanced by the brittle lighting at the top left of the picture which brings the vine and its tendrils into prominence. The badge on Guildford's cap bears geometrical forms which are also found in D�rer's Melancolia I (1514)

38937-01gesuat.jpg	In 1737, Tiepolo signed an important contract with the Dominican Order in Venice, agreeing the decoration of the church of the Gesuati (or Jesuits), Santa Maria del Rosario, built in 1720 - the artist's first great ceiling decoration for a church interior in Venice. Beginning in 1738, Tiepolo created a total of 40 frescoes of varying dimensions within the very short period of twelve months. Three large frescoes cover the centre of the vault of the Jesuit church: the Glory of St Dominic, the Institution of the Rosary, and the Virgin Appearing to St Dominic. Medallions portraying the fifteen mysteries of the Rosary decorate the rest of the ceiling. The symbols of the four Evangelists are represented over the high altar, a medallion of King David Playing the Harp, surrounded by the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, hangs over the choir's central bay, with a further medallion of the Holy Trinity placed on the choir wall.The organization of the ceiling follows the Venetian tradition in ceiling painting, in the same manner as Veronese's famous decoration in the Sala del Collegio in the Doge's Palace in Venice. Tiepolo's decoration benefits from the brightness of the church interior, which is lit by six large windows, and his frescoes harmonize in an extraordinary fashion with the architecture of the vault. The light and clear style of the painting also contributes to the legibility of the frescoes, and translates the Dominican rhetoric into images anyone can understand

16953-centre.jpg	The picture shows the central panel of the Portinari Triptych.The Adoration of the Shepherds, the most important work by the greatest Netherlandish painter of the late 15th century, has a unique historical and artistic significance. The altar was donated to the Florentine church of San Egidio by Tommaso Portinari, who since 1465 had been living in princely style in Bruges as manager of the Medici family's commercial interests. The central panel is flanked by two wings depicting other members of the Portinari family and the family's patron saints, with a grisaille Annunciation on their reverse.From an artistic point of view, the differences between this work and those of the preceding generation, and indeed earlier paintings by the same master, are astounding. While space and anatomy are easily mastered, they are no longer major themes of the composition, The infant Jesus lies within an aureole in an outdoor square, surrounded by his parents, clusters of angels and the worshipping shepherds. The more or less circular arrangement of the figures can be perceived equally in three-dimensional and two-dimensional terms. While the figures may have lost volume in comparison to the Monforte Altar, their faces and gestures have gained in expressiveness. A certain impression of spatial depth is suggested by the figures' varying distances from the front of the picture and by the oblique line running from the Antique-style column beside Joseph in the left-hand foreground, through the manger with the ox and ass, and on through the buildings in the middle ground. Its logic is overthrown, however, as the artist reverts to the medieval system in which figures are portrayed on a scale directly related to their importance. Thus the angels in the foreground are surprisingly small in comparison to Mary and Joseph - a contrast repeated in the sizes of the donors and saints portrayed in the wings.Details such as the angels in their copes and the still-life of flowers in the foreground are executed with an exquisite delicacy unsurpassed in the entire painting of the Early Renaissance.The influence of the Portinari Altar, which was erected in Florence in 1478, was felt by many of the Florentine painters and is reflected in particular in the works of Ghirlandaio and Leonardo

11976-1repeta2.jpg	In 1701 the marquis Scipione Repeta engaged Vincenzan architect Francesco Muttoni to rebuild the old family palace located in Piazza San Lorenzo, Vicenza. The project was completed in 1711. The monumental double-flight staircase leading to the piano nobile was completed in 1707, according to the inscription above the arch next to the second landing.The ceiling of the staircase was frescoed by the French artist Louis Dorigny, who displayed a masterly skill in his use of perspective, opening up an oval space on the ceiling that frames a view of sky in which the scene Minerva Casting Out the Vices unfold. To the sides, four large, faux Palladian windows, half-hidden by groupings of clouds, hold two theologian virtues - Hope and Charity - and two cardinal virtues - Justice and Fortitude - all accompanied by their respective attributes.

15186-jaelsise.jpg	Sisera was a cruel Canaanite leader who ruled the Israelites for twenty years. Barak defeated his nine hundred charioteers by a surprise Israelite attack. Sisera escaped and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite. She gave the terrified Canaanite sanctuary. When he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg into his brain. The act fulfilled the prediction of Debora, prophetess and Israelite leader, who foresaw that a woman would slay Sisera.This famous episode from the Old Testament was painted by the artist at the end of her eight-year stay in Florence. She set the scene not in Jael's tent but in a palace interior that features a large pillar. The dramatic composition shows only the two main actors with the pillar bearing Artemisia's declaration of authorship. The heads of the two protagonists are well preserved, and their physiognomies are far from standard. They truly seem to be intended as portraits

35950-3utrech5.jpg	In this outstanding architectural view, painted three years before the artist's death and one of the masterpieces of his maturity, Saenredam shows the almost deserted Mariaplaats on a quiet summer's afternoon. The twelfth-century Mariakerk is on the right: in the middle of the Gothic rose window in the Romanesque facade is the golden crown commemorating Emperor Hendrick IV (1050-1106). On the left is a high wall with gates which opened onto the gardens of houses belonging to the deans of the chapter of St Mary. In the background is a row of houses with stepped gables and rising above them are the towers of the Buurkerk on the left, with its wooden roof, and the Cathedral, with its slender octagonal lantern. The painting is signed and dated above the door of the church.Pieter Saenredam, the son of the distinguished engraver Jan Saenredam, was a painter of church interiors and topographical views. Born in Assendelft, he was taken as child to Haarlem and remained there for the rest of his life, entering the guild as a master in 1623. He made very precise architectural drawings which he then transferred to panel or canvas, sometimes making small modifications for compositional reasons. As was his usual method of work, Saenredam based this painting on a detailed drawing made (as he notes in a lengthy inscription) 'from life' on 18 September 1636, in brown ink and watercolour. (The drawing is today in the Teylers Museum, Haarlem.) Saenredam, using the drawing twenty-six years after he had made it, drew a grid on the panel in order to transfer the composition from the drawing to scale. In some areas of the picture, for example beneath the rose window, the construction lines can be seen through a thin layer of transparent paint

31122-5maxen01.jpg	The story continues in the lower picture compartment of the right wall with the battle Constantine wins over Maxentius under the sign of the cross. The night before the battle the emperor (who took up a position with his army next to the river) was awakened by an angel, who told him to look up at the sky. There he saw a glowing cross circled by the words 'in hoc signo vinces.' The next morning he had a replica of the cross made and carried it before him into the battle, in which he was victorious.This episode certainly carried an important idealistic hidden meaning and also touched on contemporary events, at a time when Pius II was planning a crusade against the Turks. All attempts to reconcile the two churches had in fact failed, so that, after the Turkish conquest of Constantinople, the only solution appeared to be to unite all Christians in the struggle against the Infidel.In Piero's fresco, Constantine face is a portrait of John VIII Palaeologus, former Eastern Emperor. And just as Constantine had gone into battle, leading his troops carrying the symbol of the Cross, so the modern Emperor can defeat the Infidel by leading all Christian armies into battle. But beyond this symbolism the battle between Constantine and Maxentius is depicted as a splendid parade, from which the crashing of arms has definitely been eliminated. The absence of movement immortalizes the horses with raised hoofs in the act of jumping, the shouting warriors with open mouths, all fixed once again by the unbending rules of construction according to linear perspective.Compared to the Battle of San Romano, painted by Paolo Uccello about twenty years earlier and which was one of the highest achievements of that Florentine pictorial perspective that inspired the young Piero, in the Arezzo fresco there is a totally new depth of space between the figures. A realistic atmosphere, conveyed by the bright lighting, emphasizes the various spatial planes. Within this composition, Piero della Francesca succeeded in reproducing, thanks to his highly refined use of bright colours, all the visual aspects of reality, even the most fleeting and immaterial ones. From the reflections of light on the armour, to the shadows of the horses' hoofs on the ground, to the wide open sky with its spring clouds tossed by the wind, the reality of nature is reproduced exactly, down to its most ephemeral details.

03213-selfporx.jpg	The way Barocci composed his flesh tints can be perceived as his individual hand. As a rule, he based them on a preparatory modelling of grey hues. In his self-portrait, he combined the grey and bluish-grey half-tones with single accents of vivid vermilion.

22387-sacrific.jpg	Born in Verona into a family of artists and craftsmen producing silk, tapestries and arms, Ligozzi did most of his painting in Florence. He showed in his works an initial adhesion to a Mannerism of Michelangiolesque stamp, only later to become an interpreter and popularizer of Venetian painting with its emphasis on colour. With this work we are probably at around the halfway stage in the stylistic development of the artist, who has produced here a somewhat complicated and over-emphatic construction, with twisted, elongated figures arranged in a kind of ideal pyramid. The forms are pleasant and accurate, indicative of an excellent `disegno' - a technique in which Jacopo Ligozzi excelled, together with pastel drawing and tempera - and remarkable compositional balance

07727-salmacis.jpg	Giovanni Carnovali, an Italian painter, is known as Il Piccio.In Greek mythology, Hermaphroditus or Hermaphroditos was the child of Aphrodite and Hermes. He was a minor deity of bisexuality and effeminacy. According to the legend, he grew up to become an incredibly beautiful and masculine man. One day while he was in the woods, a nymph named Salmacis saw him and became so infatuated with him that she grabbed hold of him and refused to let go. She made a prayer to the gods to make them never part. It was the Greek way of explaining why one out of every fifty people was a hermaphrodite. Hermaphroditus later became friends with Dionysius and the two gods are considered to be the patron gods of all hermaphrodites

04107-i_sunset.jpg	Berchem's pictures have a more pronounced pastoral character than Jan Both's or Asselyn's. Shepherds and buxom shepherdesses tending their flocks and herdsmen guarding their cattle receive prominent places in his works. His lively figures are seen in sparkling Italian light among ancient ruins, fording rivers, or set against magnificent panoramic views of vast Italian valleys and mountain ranges. The large scale of his figures often suggests his paintings could be classified as pastoral genre scenes as well as landscapes - the same is true of many of Jan Baptist Weenix's Italianate paintings. Wisps of white cloud float in Berchem's dazzling blue skies, and bits of vividly coloured clothing worn by herders, milkmaids, and travellers brighten the cool greens of his landscapes. His peasants enjoy a life of innocence and happiness among their animals. It is an idyllic dream world which appealed to a public that found Arcadia a refuge from worldly cares and responsibility.The mood of his pictures justifies the claim that Berchem, who died in I683, the year Watteau was born, is one of the precursors of the Rococo. Berchem's success stimulated a number of close followers. Karel Dujardin was his pupil. The genre painters Pieter de Hooch and Jacob Ochtervelt, artists who soon went their own way, also studied with him

26602-2ceil_vf.jpg	"In planning the architectural design Michelangelo first had to accommodate his program to the pre-existing building, including the windows, which were the source of light for his decoration. The wreath of openings still provides the principal viewing light.Michelangelo devised a long central area framed by a fictive marble cornice and separated into nine sections by broad pilaster strips bent across the ceiling, also in imitation white marble. Sections of alternating dimensions are framed between wider and narrower bands. Within them Michelangelo varied the size of the actual narratives, giving only the smaller ones a marble frame. Four ignudi (male nudes), among the most admired elements of the ceiling, ostensibly support ribbons attached to large medallions painted to look like bronze. Twenty in all, they are in different poses, producing, together with the Prophets and Sibyls, a ""handbook"" of alternatives for the seated figure for later artists.At the corners of the ceiling Michelangelo has painted four salvation subjects, including David and Goliath and Judith and Holofernes. Triangular-shaped compartments are repeated in a continuous band along the entire border of the ceiling; they contain bronze-colored nudes that alternate with the renowned Prophets and Sibyls set into marble thrones which, in turn, have paired marble putti in a variety of poses and positions that expand upon the tradition of Donatello and Luca della Robbia. The ancestors of Christ are painted on the flat side walls, the only section of the decoration that did not require the visual adjustments posed by painting on a curved surface"

26766-1lastjud.jpg	"This fresco was commissioned by Pope Clement VII (1523-1534) shortly before his death. His successor, Paul III Farnese (1534-1549), forced Michelangelo to a rapid execution of this work, the largest single fresco of the century.The first impression we have when faced with the Last Judgment is that of a truly universal event, at the centre of which stands the powerful figure of Christ. His raised right hand compels the figures on the lefthand side, who are trying to ascend, to be plunged down towards Charon and Minos, the Judge of the Underworld; while his left hand is drawing up the chosen people on his right in an irresistible current of strength. Together with the planets and the sun, the saints surround the Judge, confined into vast spacial orbits around Him. For this work Michelangelo did not choose one set point from which it should be viewed. The proportions of the figures and the size of the groups are determined, as in the Middle Ages, by their single absolute importance and not by their relative significance. For this reason, each figure preserves its own individuality and both the single figures arid the groups need their own background.The figures who, in the depths of the scene, are rising from their graves could well be part of the prophet Ezechiel's vision. Naked skeletons are covered with new flesh, men dead for immemorable lengths of time help each other to rise from the earth. For the representation of the place of eternal damnation, Michelangelo was clearly inspired by the lines of the Divine Comedy:Charon the demon, with eyes of glowing coal/Beckoning them, collects them all,/Smites with his oar whoever lingers.According to Vasari, the artist gave Minos, the Judge of the Souls, the semblance of the Pope's Master of Ceremonies, Biagio da Cesena, who had often complained to the Pope about the nudity of the painted figures. We know that many other figures, as well, are portraits of Michelangelo's contemporaries. The artist's self-portrait appears twice: in the flayed skin which Saint Bartholomew is carrying in his left-hand, and in the figure in the lower left hand corner, who is looking encouragingly at those rising from their graves. The artist could not have left us clearer evidence of his feeling towards life and of his highest ideals.The painting is a turning point in the history of art. Vasari predicted the phenomenal impact of the work: ""This sublime painting"", he wrote, ""should serve as a model for our art. Divine Providence has bestowed it upon the world to show how much intelligence she can deal out to certain men on earth. The most expert draftsman trembles as he contemplates these bold outlines and marvellous foreshortenings. In the presence of this celestial work, the senses are paralysed, and one can only wonder at the works that came before and the works that shall come after"""

Conquering such tall spaces was made easier by a more modern scaffolding design widely employed following the building of the new Saint Peter's. The cupola fresco in the pilgrimage church of Regina Montis Regalis, erected on the site of an appearance of the Virgin  near Vicoforte, in Piedmont, serves as an example of how, thanks to technical and artistic innovations, architecture and decoration led to a solution virtually impossible to outdo in theatrical opulence.The Venetian Mattia Bortolini and the virtually unknown quadratura painter Felice Biella painted the shell of the cupola, which rises above a tall, light-filled drum and presents a surface area of more than 6.000 sq.m in a mere three years, using the simulated coffering that had already been painted for an Assumption of the Virgin which they kept

08606-annunci1.jpg	Champaigne was in the habit of producing highly finished small versions of his large pictures, unusually for a French artist of his time. It is not always clear whether these versions were finished modellos in the Italian manner, designed to be shown to the client before the expensive large picture was begun (as was often the custom in Italy) or whether they were replicas painted afterwardThis is a carefully finished modello for the large picture in the Wallace Collection, London, which could well have been painted for the Palais Royal in about 1644. In the small small picture the modelling, colour and line are precise, but there is a certain sensuality in their treatment, clearly marking the artist's Flemish origins. In the large version in the Wallace Collection all trace of this disappeared and, instead, a grandeur is achieved by a large amount of space in the composition and a treatment of the draperies as if they were metal foil or even sculpture

Canaletto's abstract poetry was dependent on a visual rediscovery of the historic landscape, while Guardi gave it a lyric vibrancy by means of atmospheric effects. Bellotto's views, however, present specific and impressive images of reality. He is thus the major representative of the objective view, obtained by the use of the camera obscura. Bellotto's purpose in utilizing the device was not to give a photographic order to things, nor to exalt their atmospheric emanations; his aim was rather to seek out the nature and inner truth of the landscape, whether urban, rural or marine.

16818-1troia2.jpg	As work was coming to an end at the Palazzo del T�, Giulio Romano increased the number of new projects in various places and varying degrees of importance. One of his most significant projects in this period, though, was the decoration of Federico Gonzaga's official apartment in the Palazzo Ducale, Mantua, later called the Appartamento di Troia (Troy Apartment) after its most important room, the Sala di Troia. It was begun in 1536 and completed around 1540.The scenes painted on the ceiling and walls of the Sala di Troia narrate the Greek victory over the Trojans as it is recounted in The Iliad. The battle itself rages across the ceiling: desperate horses and warriors lie on their backs while victorious heroes stand over them. The scene is painted as a continuum interrupted only by trees painted to conceal the angular corners of the room. The paintings on the walls narrate individual stories from the war, and they are isolated in giant fictive frames. These scenes, painted by Giulio's students, include the construction of the Trojan Horse, Laoco�n and His Sons Attacked by Serpents, Hecuba's Dream, and the Death of Ajax.The room was originally decorated all the way down to the floor pavement with military trophies and faux marble, and as a whole it alludes to the military virtues of Federico Gonzaga

29941-fishsell.jpg	The ugly face of this fat woman convinces one that she has spent all her life as a fishwife. She is framed by the outline of the market-stall with its board for a counter. Against this background of silver-scaled fish she herself looks like some frog-eyed creature, colourfully dressed for market. The picture is small but the artist has filled in a background depicting the teeming life of the market. Every detail, the display of fish, the figure behind the stall, the small building and the general view in the background together make up an animated scene which is captivating despite a complete absence of dramatic episodes, tension or humour.Van Ostade was in the habit of painting several versions of a favourite motif, and a larger version, now in the Rijkmuseum in Amsterdam, bears the date 1672.

By the 1860s, despite his established fame, Meissonier began to focus his compositions on scenes of Napoleonic glory.

07458-041boy.jpg	This picture is wrongly said by Mancini not to be one of Caravaggio's earliest pictures, and since he also states that the picture was sold for less than Caravaggio expected, it must have been painted as a speculative venture.One of the most effeminate of his boy models, with a rose in his hair, starts back in pain as his right-hand middle finger, which he has put into a cluster of fruit, is bitten by a lizard. The rose behind the ear, the cherries, the third finger and the lizard probably have sexual significance - the boy becomes aware, with a shock, of the pains of physical love. What was novel was not the theme so much as its dramatic treatment, evident in the boy's foreshortened right shoulder, the contrasting gestures of his hands and the leftward sloping light. What lingers most in the memory is found in the foreground: the gleaming glass carafe containing a single overblown rose in water, together with its reflections.Two almost identical examples of this composition exist (the other in the Longhini Collection, Florence). Their equally high quality suggests that Caravaggio himself painted them both

01018-campipai.jpg	One of the period's most inventive portraitists came from Cremona. The noblewoman Sofonisba Anguissola created wry and witty portraits of family members and acquaintances, a subject largely imposed upon her by societal restrictions on female access to models and patrons. Sofonisba's painting of her teacher, painting her portrait - a story within a story - demonstrates how she negotiated her male-dominated world. Anguissola's gaze rivets the viewer of the painting, forcing consideration of what appears to be the inscribing of male authority on the body of the female. Campi's gaze complicates matters, however, since as he paints he, too, looks out of the painting toward what the picture indicates must be his subject, Anguissola. Thus the viewer in front of the painting plays a double role: that of the subject of the painting within the painting, namely Anguissola herself, and of an engaged viewer - watched by both Campi and Anguissola - made complicit in Anguissola's destabilizing of contemporary social norms

17254-auvers14.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 753, JH 2007.In May 1890 van Gogh left the South of France and moved to a village forty miles outside Paris, Auvers. There he was very productive, painting over sixty pictures, and drawing a great deal before he wounded himself fatally and died on 29 July. Auvers had many connections with painters. Both Pissarro and C�zanne had worked there in the 1870s, and Dr Gachet, friend of Pissarro, amateur painter, and avid collector of modern French art, kept that link alive.Van Gogh's portrait of the doctor is a curious one. He claimed that it was intended to convey the heart-broken expression of modern times. Indeed the pose, head on hand, is a traditional representation of melancholy. There are other symbols and emblems. The foxgloves are thought to be a reference to Gachet's practice as a homeopathic doctor. The inclusion of two novels (in this case by the de Goncourt brothers) is not without precedent in van Gogh's portraiture. Both of these novels are about Paris; Manette Salomon is in fact about a Parisian artist and his model. Germinie Lacerteux was the story of the tragic life of a domestic servant who fell disastrously in love. For van Gogh, city life in general - and Paris in particular - was a place of melancholy and ill health. The country was its opposite, restorative and strengthening. The portrait of Gachet is an ambitious attempt to make a kind of historical portrait of modern man, suffering from the ill effects of urban life, from which there was no real escape but for which art could offer its unreal consolations

43544-lukepain.jpg	Maarten De Vos, who founded the fraternity of Romanists in Antwerp, was Frans Floris' best pupil and successor. His works are clear precursors of the 17th century Baroque. The Saint Luke painting the Virgin Mary is a late work by De Vos who died in 1603. His rich and varied use of colour might be attributable to the six years he spent in Florence, Rome and Venice (where he studied with Tintoretto); his paintings are clear, balanced and often symmetrical in composition, and despite his preference for shallow spaces, he succeeded in creating a strong sense of drama and plasticity. On the other hand, although a Lutheran for a long time, De Vos was also a figure-head of the Counter Reformation. The best evidence of this is to be found in the monumental scale of his works and his strict adherence to the iconographical precepts laid down by the Council of Trent

The gallery was completed in 1826 under Nicholas I, Alexander I's brother and successor.To create portraits for the gallery, Alexander I chose English painter George Dawe, who had been presented to the emperor at the 1818 Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen), where the leaders of the victorious coalition discussed Europe's new frontiers after Napoleon. The list of heroes to be depicted was drawn up by the General Staff and personally confirmed by the emperor.

29518-madonna1.jpg	Around the turn of the 1460s and '70s, Neroccio and Francesco di Giorgio created together a new, blonde and ethereal female ideal in Sienese painting, of which this Madonna is an especially beautiful example.In this composition, a slender and long-necked Virgin holds before her the Child, who looks up at his mother while blessing and supporting himself on the armrest of the throne. The sweeping outline of Mary's gold-edged cloak, sharply delineated against the gold ground, still follows the Ducciesque tradition, but signs of receptivity to the new style can be discerned in every detail of the picture.

30654-allegor.jpg	The repertoire of objects in a vanitas still-life is confined to external power symbols: crowns - including the papal tiara and mitres, as well as kingly crowns - and a knight's armour were always part of such still-lifes, as was the globe as a symbol of worldwide expansion and a craving for conquests. These 'elements of vanity' are of central importance in this painting by Pereda.A young nobleman has fallen asleep in an armchair on the left, his head, pale with sleep, supported by one hand. The content of his dream - the world and its vanity - is displayed on the table on the right, against a pitch-black background. Other objects of vanity, apart from the power insignia mentioned above, are books, music, coins, jewellery, weapons and a mask (as a symbol of Thalia - the theatre). These are all considered futile. Transience is symbolized by two skulls - one of them rolled over so that we can see inside - as well as by a burnt candle and a clock. The flowers in the vase, too, are symbols of vanity.

25986-02last.jpg	Although known to be an early work, this triptych is Memling's most monumental composition and one of his plastically most accomplished. A perfectly symmetrical, semi-circular line of bodies runs through the continuous space of all three panels, with the calm upward movement of the Reception of the Righteous into Heaven balanced by the turbulent Casting of the Damned into Hell on the opposite side.Although it was one of Memling's first creations in Bruges, it already displays impressive mastery. The work was commissioned by Angelo Tani (1415-1492), the Florentine manager of the Medici bank in Bruges, for the altar of his newly founded chapel in the church of the Badia Fiesolana in Florence. The commission coincided with Tani's wedding in 1466 to Caterina Tanagli, with whom he is portrayed on the closed wings. The painting was completed before the birth of the couple's first daughter in 1471, and was dispatched to Porto Pisano via Southampton in 1473. But while the ship was still in Zealand waters, it was intercepted by a Polish warship operating on behalf of the Hanseatic League. The League was engaged at the time in a boycott of trade with England, the interim destination of the vessel carrying the altarpiece. The painting was taken to Danzig (Gdansk), where it was to remain. The composition is a reformulation of Van der Weyden's Beaune altarpiece, with a number of noteworthy quotations and differences. Rogier's extremely wide, layered and hieratical image has been reduced, made narrower and clarified by diminishing the disproportionate relationship between the divine and earthly spheres. The central, monumental figures remain Christ and St Michael with the scales, and the bank of cloud is also paraphrased. The archangel dressed as a priest has, however, been transformed into a soldier. The Christ figure is as good as a copy - a remarkable and unique occurrence in Memling's oeuvre. If we throw in the strongly Rogierian style of the apostles' heads, it is almost impossible not to conclude that Memling saw the Beaune altarpiece with his own eyes.

10579-feathers.jpg	"The picture represents an ""Indian"" feather picture, in which the pictorial motif is composed of many small, colourfully dazzling bird feathers. It originates from Michoac�n, Mexico, where the pre-Hispanic art of feather painting flourished in the early colonial period under the auspices of Bishop Vasco de Quiroga (1470-1565) at trade schools attached to the region's Augustinian monasteries, particularly the one in Tiripetio, and later in workshops in other towns around Lake P�tzcuaro. The shown example and its companion piece representing the Weeping Virgin, were signed by Juan Bautista Cuiris.The inspiration for the feather mosaics was traced back to engravings executed in Rome by the French-born engraver Philippe Thomassin (1562-1622) around 1590, Thomassin, who was close to the circle of Giulio Romano and Antonio Tempesta, based the engravings on drawings by the miniaturist Giulio Clovio. The relative speed with which these Italian Mannerist images traveled to Michoac�n and back again to Europe - probably passing through Spain before ultimately enriching the Kunstkammer of Rudolph II in Vienna - is an interesting example of artistic diffusion in the sixteenth century"

00935-50annale.jpg	The painting got the name from its original location, the Convento di San Vincenzo d'Annalena, founded by Annalena Malatesta.This is Angelico's second sacra conversazione, and shares many elements in common with its forerunner, the San Marco altarpiece. Unlike the San Marco altarpiece, however, there are no angels here and the Virgin and Child are in the company only of Sts Peter Martyr, Cosmas, Damian, John the Evangelist, Lawrence and Francis. Although they have left their individual panels, never to return, there is still an echo of these in the blank arches of the wall which closes the back of the picture.The high wall and its pink cornice run the full width of the panel. The natural world, which was the setting of the first altarpiece, is now confined to the grass and flowers at the very front of the picture. There is no carpet on the ground here and the foreground is much shallower than in the earlier work. The method of space projection remains basically the same and relies on the receding rectangles of the steps to the throne and of its cornice. An element common to both altarpieces is the use of a carpet running across the back of the picture parallel to the picture plane

42215-0201vela.jpg	Vel�zquez made much use of Caravaggesque chiaroscuro in his early pictures. However, he turned the Italian artist's almost aggressive realism into a sharpness of perception that is softened by such picturesque devices as strangely new colours, always in earthy hues, and by his equating of objects and humans in a manner suggesting the experiences of dreams.A particularly fine example of this approach is Vel�zquez' first real masterpiece, the Waterseller. An old man whose poor clothing and sharply lit profile are ennobled by the light falling on him is handing a boy a glass of water. The forceful way in which the two jugs, shining in the light, make their presence felt in the foreground, the brilliance of the sparkling drops of water on the curve of the larger pitcher, and the beautiful transparency of the glass match the physical and mental qualities suggested by the three human figures

19132-30drink.jpg	The Merry Drinker is painted in a bright, blond tonality which anticipates nineteenth-century Impressionism in its most brilliant manifestations. Manet must have been particularly impressed by this painting. The picture also shows Hals supreme mastery of one of the principal preoccupations of Baroque artists: the rendering of instantaneous emotion and movement. No seventeenth-century artist surpassed Hals in this fields. The realism and illusionism of Caravaggio and his followers look forced compared to Hals, and Rubens and van Dyck do not convey a comparable intensity in the suggestion of a fleeting instant packed with vitality. Hals's vigorous concentration on this was more than an ordinary rendering of reality. He selected moments when human nature reveals all its vital energy. Most frequently he shows the instant when the joy of life is at its highest.

07977-farnes22.jpg	The figure of Venus can be traced back to one of Raphael's compositions that circulated as an engraving; it reconstructs the marriage of Alexander and Roxane, an antique painting known only from literary sources.The paintings in the Galleria Farnese are erotic, in the broadest sense of the word, for the overarching theme of the scenes is the omnipotence of love, 'omnia vincit amor' (love conquers all), as expressed by Virgil in the Eclogues. The medallion to the right of the Venus-Anchises scene illustrates this saying precisely, for it is Cupid who is shown triumphing over Pan.The Farnese Gallery, in which a love for classical antiquity goes hand in hand with extraordinary naturalism, set in a highly effective illusionistic layout, became Annibale Carracci's most famous and hailed achievement, a source of inspiration continually updated in later centuries

04848-bogdan01.jpg	"It was probably in Vienna that Jakab Bogd�ny, the son of a Protestant family in the town of Eperjes, began his studies; later, between 1684 and 1688, he worked in Amsterdam, which was then the centre of the bourgeois genres, most notably of still-life painting. For the young painter, the Dutch influence proved decisive on several account: it can be detected in his still-lifes with flowers and fruits in the use of colours, while the genre-like composition of his paintings depicting birds reveals the assimilation of Melchior de Hondecoeter's paintings of animals. Elegant parks with beautiful birds are the sites of Bogd�ny's high society genre scenes. The exquisite components, such as fountains or antique ruins, enhance the grace and refinement of the composition. The painter obeyed the taste of his commissioners and made their paintings to fit into their surroundings. Bogd�ny, who moved to England in 1688 and worked for the royal family and for the members of the English aristocracy, died as an esteemed artist.He studied the main attractions of his compositions, the exotic birds from the colonies, in the then very fashionable birds' houses; their precise depiction can also be seen in the painting ""Still-life with Birds"" from the 1710s. Bogd�ny's paintings are still kept in their original surrounding, in English mansions and in the summer resorts of the Royal Family."

14652-02baronc.jpg	The naves of the Franciscan and Dominican Gothic churches in Italy were simple, compared to their northern equivalents, they were used mainly for preaching, but they were also built to be constantly adaptable, especially to the addition and decoration of private chapels where wealthy merchant families were commemorated.. Typical is the the basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, built by the Franciscan in 1296, with its slender, widely spaced piers and the Baroncelli Chapel, painted by Giotto's godson and pupil Taddeo Gaddi.Taddeo painted the chapel so as to capture the effects of actual southern light coming through the lancet window. He placed a series of mystical experiences, one above the other, at the left. At the top is the Annunciation of the Virgin, traditionally associated with the propagation of light because Mary conceived Christ without any material  rupture of her body. In the annunciation to the shepherds below, another, more sudden, incandescent flash of light shocks the shepherds from their sleep. The three Magi on the bottom tier kneel before another vision, this time of the infant Christ, glistening like a star before them. Light here is identified with revelation and patterned to coincide with the light streaming through the actual window.Another important visual element in the Baroncelli Chapel is the altarpiece, a polyptych of the Coronation of the Virgin painted by Giotto and his assistants. Originally it was not in a classical rectangular frame but in a structure with pointed canopies that echoed the shape of the stained-glass window above it

10825-stvaast3.jpg	Jacques Daret was a pupil of Robert Campin (the Master of Fl�malle) and is documented as his apprentice from 1427 to 1432. In around 1435 he was working in the Abbey of San Vaast, near Arras, on an altarpiece of the Nativity cycle, of which this present panel was a part.The similarity between this painting and a Nativity by the Master of Fl�malle makes it seem likely that Daret based his work on the earlier painting. The two paintings use very similar compositions, of a type which would later become widespread in Flemish painting. The main scene with the manger and the figures takes place in the foreground, while on the right is an open space with a landscape which extends into the background. While Daret's painting simplifies the composition by using fewer figures, making the narrative easier to comprehend, it includes the two midwives (Zelomi and Salome), the figure of Joseph holding a cloth, and the small angels flying over the stable - all of which appear in both versions

44088-1hubert1.jpg	"In 1436 Rogier van der Weyden was appointed to the office of town painter of Brussels, the most important city in  the duchy of Brabant and one of the main residences of the Duke of Burgundy. Rogier's position is probably connected with his acceptance of the most important commission the city could give an artist, the huge Scenes of Justice for the town hall. (Unfortunately these were destroyed during the bombardment of Brussels by the French troops of Louis XIV in 1695.)This huge commission from the city must have demanded an enormous amount of working capacity on Rogier's part, and at the same time would have raised his reputation greatly. In Brussels, which appears to have had no artistic tradition of any significance before his arrival, he must soon have become a fashionable painter in great demand. For this large civic commission of course he needed assistants, who would also help to supply other demands. The regulations of the Brussels painters' guild allowed a master to have only one apprentice at a time, but placed no restriction on the number of journeymen he could employ. Rogier presumably employed more and more assistants to work on the pictures, though only a single original source refers to them: when an altarpiece was installed in Cambrai in 1459, several ""ouvriers"" (workmen, or more likely assistants) are mentioned.Among extant paintings, there are already works from around 1440 which closely resemble Rogier's artistically, but are different from paintings by his own hand, and so are probably by the employees of his workshop. At this point he would not have had time to train more than one apprentice to the point of being qualified to set up independently, so there can hardly have been any ""successors"" of Rogier yet. However, he could already have passed on his technique and style to a number of journeymen, who would then have been able both to assist him in working on the city's huge commission, and also to produce independent paintings of their own which could leave the workshop under the name of ""Rogier.""Two panels with scenes from the life of St. Hubert show that he did in fact employ several relatively independent assistants. These scenes are very much in Rogier's style, but diverge from his major works in both execution and layout. Both panels were originally in the chapel of St Hubert in St Gudule, the main church of Brussels. The chapel was donated in 1437 by two prosperous citizens, Jan Cools and Jan Vrientschap, who probably commissioned the paintings at the same time; the two paintings seem originally to have been part of a larger series, and may well have been ready for the dedication of the chapel in 1439.These two extant panels are clearly the work of different artists, and indeed it seems likely, judging by the various different ways of painting faces, that several painters may have worked on the Exhumation of St Hubert. The two pictures are considerably different from each other in design, a feature particularly obvious in the differences of spatial depiction; the Exhumation of St Hubert, which is executed to a very high standard, is more convincing in this respect, and does not show the exaggerated effect of depth that makes the room in the Dream of Pope Sergius look like a tunnel.The scene of Dream of Pope Sergius is set around 705 in Rome, identifiable from the Castel Sant'Angelo, ancient ruins, and old St Peter's. An angel appears to Pope Sergius in a dream, telling him to appoint a pilgrim named Hubert to the office of the murdered bishop of Li�ge, St Lambert. At their very back, outside the portal of St Peter's, the Pope is giving Hubert the episcopal crozier and miter. Since this panel and its pendant do not show the most important events in the life of St Hubert, they must have been part of an extensive series of pictures.The men who worked in Rogier's workshop were obviously more than mere humble assistants in the execution of paintings; when the number of commissions on hand made it necessary, they even designed pictures with relative independence. In doing so they naturally used their master's formulae and his figure types. Rogier's assistants also resorted to models already in the workshop for such features as the pattern of textiles; the patterned green fabric of the altar cloth in the Exhumation of St Hubert had already featured in the under-dress of the young woman to the left in the Deposition (Prado, Madrid), and the pattern appears again a good deal later in the scene of the Annunciation on the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), on a carpet"

42831-04lattu3.jpg	In the last decade of his life Veronese painted a large decorative cycle of eleven canvases for the Venetian church of San Nicol&#242; dei Frari, popularly known as San Nicol&#242; della Lattuga, which was stripped of its ornaments in 1806. Three of the paintings (Saint Nicholas named Bishop of Myra, Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata and the Crucifixion) are now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. The Adoration of the Magi, surrounded by four figures of Evangelists, was adapted and mounted on the ceiling of the presbytery of the chapel of the Rosary in Santi Giovanni e Paolo in 1929. The large canvas depicting the Baptism and Temptations of Christ, formerly in the chancel of San Nicol&#242;, was transferred to Brera in 1809. Finally, the two Prophets in monochrome that were originally located at the sides of the high altar are now in the Fondazione Cini in Venice.In his narration of the episodes Veronese gave expression to a dramatic tension, an intensely emotional involvement that was certainly unprecedented in his earlier handling of similar subjects. To achieve this, he profoundly modified his normal modes of expression, creating new structures of composition that he would use frequently in his paintings from this moment on.In the scene of the Crucifixion the figure of Christ is placed on the left-hand side of the picture and is given great prominence simply by its location. Similarly, the whole right-hand side of the painting is taken up by the landscape with numerous agitated figures of horsemen and bystanders in the foreground

22632-05adora.jpg	This tondo has long been the subject of scholarly debate over its authorship which has oscillated between Fra Filippo Lippi and Fra Angelico. It was painted for Cosimo de' Medici, or at least we know it was in the Medici Palace according to an inventory taken in 1492 where it was listed as by Fra Angelico.Following the three kings a splendid procession, symbolizing all the races of mankind, waits to pay homage to the new-born Christ. The peacock is a symbol of the Resurrection. Some scholars believe that Fra Angelico laid out the composition and painted the Virgin and Child and at least some of the figures at the upper right; then his associate and fellow monk Fra Filippo Lippi completed the work.The Virgin is the only one of the main figures in the work considered to be by Angelico

41968-sacrific.jpg	The painting in every respect embodies the essence of the high Baroque in Seville, a movement principally identified with the work of Vald�s Leal's near-contemporary, Murillo. The scene is a key event in the Old Testament, in which the faith of the great Hebrew patriarch undergoes the ultimate test, and as a result of his unshakeable belief in God leads to the proliferation of his line. The artist has chosen to depict the moment of highest drama, when the angel stays the hand of Abraham who is on the point of slaying his only son

12577-3stanne.jpg	This is a devotional image that Leonhard Tucher commissioned from D�rer. In 1628, it was offered by Gabriel III Tucher to Maximilian of Bavaria, who did not consider it to be an original. After having passed from collection to collection, it was acquired in 1910 by Benjamin Altmann, who donated it in 1913 to the museum in New York.After having formerly been considered at times a copy, today the panel is generally held to be an original work of D�rer. The theme treated is often found in the altarpieces in Nuremberg, which are obviously of different scales and are solemn and monumental. Here the close and more familiar rapport the patron had with the requested painting led D�rer to prefer a more intimate interpretation.D�rer's work is triangular in composition. St Anne, the mother of the Virgin, places her left hand on her daughter's shoulder, in a gesture of consolation. The youthful Mary worships the child, her hands together in silent prayer. The infant rests against St Anne. His expression suggests not only sleep, but death, as the two women seem to understand. A study survives of the half length figure of St Anne, probably based on D�rer's wife Agnes, then in her mid-forties. In the painting, St Anne's features have been softened and she appears younger. The picture was commissioned by Leonard Tucher, a member of the Nuremberg family whose portraits D�rer had painted earlier
