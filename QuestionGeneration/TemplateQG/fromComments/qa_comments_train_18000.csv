29531-medallio.jpg	A young officer kneels to present a medallion to a young woman sitting by a table. She receives his attentions with no show of emotion, unlike the woman behind her and the young man beside her who are preparing to drink a toast. A feature of this work is the splendid painting of the elaborate costumes worn by the protagonists. It is not possible, nor is it important, to decide whether the officer is making a declaration of love or merely handing over the medallion on behalf of some absent friend.Netscher became a pupil of Terborch sometime during the 1650s and he was the pupil who most successfully emulated the style of his master. As a young man he made excellent copies of Terborch's works. It has been suspected that the Presentation of the Medallion is an adaptation of a painting by Terborch. Although it is typical of the best of Netscher's work, the somewhat affected gesture foreshadows the approach of the later more mannered period of genre painting

00349-judith_k.jpg	"Cristofano Allori trained in the school of his father and his grandfather, the leading Florentine Mannerist Agnolo Allori, known as Bronzino. Even if Cristofano may be regarded as an artist who broke with late Mannerist tendencies and went on to become an express proponent of early Baroque reform ideas, he nevertheless continues to borrow certain traits of ""Mannerist physiognomy"" in order to heighten the effect of a picture. In his most famous painting, Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the extreme contrast between the dark and bearded head of Holofernes and the angelic face of his murderess owes much to the Mannerist school in which he was trained.Allori is said to have created a portrait of his mistress Mazzafirra in the figure of Judith and her mother in the figure of the elderly servant woman. The head of Holofernes may be a self-portrait. If this is true, the picture would certainly be a classic example of the so-called ""portrait histori�"" in which real figures are presented as figures from history. Whether or not this is true, the significance of this painting lies predominantly in the enormous erotic tension that emanates not only from the faces of Judith and Holofernes, but also from the sensuality with which the Old Testament heroine is portrayed. This major theme of triumph over tyranny had never before been presented from this point of view.This is the only painting from the long neglected Florentine school of the seventeenth century whose reputation has always remained at the highest level, and it therefore gained a sort of symbolic value. Moreover, its fame as a masterpiece of the Seicento spread beyond regional borders, thanks in part to its temporary confiscation and subsequent display in the Mus�e Napol�on in Paris between 1799 and 1815. The work is by far the best of the many existing versions, copies, and derivations. Although it is not the prime version of this much-painted composition, it is possibly the only fully autograph surviving example.Allori, a Florentine, painted this canvas during Artemisia Gentileschi's stay in Florence, and surely knew her version."

39892-assumpti.jpg	The painting in the apse of the Cathedral of Verona was executed by Francesco Torbido after the design by Giulio Romano.In the Renaissance period the decoration of the church is frequently focused on the apse and the entrance wall. These terminal walls of extended interior spaces are visible from a great distance, catching visitors' attention. The decoration of the apse towers over the events of mass at the high altar; the decoration of the inside wall of the fa�ade serves as an admonition or reinforcement for the visitors as they leave the liturgical ceremony and the church. Large format in both places called for fundamental, weighty themes.Examples of large-scale painted apse recesses are common in the areas ruled by Venice but also in Emilia. A large-scale fresco in the apse vault or on an entrance fa�ade could appear to break open the surface of the wall to provide a vision of the heavens or a view of an historical event; alternatively, it could illusionistically extend the existing architecture and enliven it with holy figures. For the archbishop of Verona, Giulio Romano designed a decoration for the chancel of the cathedral that was executed by Francesco Torbido in 11534. The painting placed Renaissance architecture on a Gothic structure. The vault of the apse is decorated with painted coffers, in front of which, at a balustrade, apostles seem to be standing in the church itself. Above the apostles, the Virgin Mary floats in a cloud toward a painted opening in the sky in the vault of the chancel. Thus Nary's Assumption seems to be happening in the church's chancel

37210-maesta01.jpg	After a few years of Duccio's Maest&#224;, Simone painted his Maest&#224; for the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, as the ideal of the good and just government. This is the oldest painting that can be safely attributed to him. The end wall of the Sala del Mappamondo (formerly known as Sala del Consiglio) is entirely covered by this fresco. Surrounded by a frame decorated with twenty medallions depicting the Blessing Christ, the Prophets and the Evangelists and with smaller shields containing the coat-of-arms of Siena, the fresco shows a host of angels, Saints and Apostles, with the Madonna and Child in the centre. The whole scene, set against a deep blue background, is surmounted by an imposing canopy of red silk.The most obvious innovations present in Simone's style are his ideas of three-dimensional space. The supporting poles of the canopy are placed in perspective, thus giving a sense of depth to the composition. Under the canopy there is a crowd of thirty people: no more processions of people in parallel rows, but concrete spacial rhythms and animated gestures

08721-shinneck.jpg	Teaching in public or state art schools by artists associated with Impressionism was of central imporrtance in the American dissemination of the new art and its ideas. Summer schools devoted to open-air painting became established in the 1890s as an integral part of American art teaching. The most popular and successful of the schools was the Shinnecock Summer School, opened on Long Island in 1891. It was founded by William Merrit Chase who taught the methods and practice of open-air painting there for twelve consecutive summers.This panel depicts a simple spot near the artist's house.

32780-21knight.jpg	The figurative powers which Raphael developed in Florence led to a more synthetic conception of form, a refinement of intellectual expression, which are visible in the Knight's Dream in the National Gallery, London, and the Three Graces of Chantilly. Critics believe that the two panels may have formed a single diptych presented to Scipione di Tommaso Borghese at his birth, in 1493. The theme of the paintings may by drawn from the poem, Punica, by Silius Italicus, which was well known in antiquity and which humanistic culture restored to fame. In the first panel, Scipio, the sleeping knight, must choose between Venus (pleasure) and Minerva (virtue); in the second, the Graces reward his choice of virtue with the Golden Apples of the Hesperides. The classical origin of this theme brings us back without doubt to the Florentine environment. The composition, which is dominated by a sense of great harmony, is a figurative consequence of the literary theme.A young knight is asleep in front of a laurel tree that divides the picture into two equal parts. There is a figure of a beautiful young woman in each half on the left the personification of Virtue is holding a book and a sword above the sleeping figure, while the figure on the right is presenting a flower as a symbol of sensual pleasure. The probable meaning of the allegory is that the young man's task is to bring both sides of life into harmony

24928-jeremiah.jpg	Like a statue that has become human or a human being turned into a statue, placed in a niche on a stone plinth, the prophet Jeremiah, richly robed in the manner of the period, is deeply absorbed in his book. Crumpled parchments, books, boxes and various other objects on the shelf above evoke the spiritual life and the literary qualities of the figure in an astonishing still-life that is precisely described in subtle and delicate colours. On the reverse the powerful figure of Christ from a Noli me tangere, whose body, violently modelled by the light, gives off a terrible sense of pathos, seems to be in total contradiction with the summarily painted landscape in which he is placed.This panel represents the left-hand wing of a now dismembered triptych, commissioned by the rich Aix draper Pierre Corpici for the altar that he had founded at the Cathedral of St Saviour's at Aix-en-Provence. The central panel, still preserved in Aix, shows an Annunciation, whilst the left-hand wing depicts, on the front, the prophet Isaiah, and on the back a Magdalen which formed a Noli me tangere along with the Christ on the back of the present panel. The archives tell us that the altarpiece was produced between 1443 and 1445 by an anonymous master, whom certain believe can be identified as Barth�l�my d'Eyck. This artist, who probably trained in Flanders, is mentioned in the accounts of the court of Ren�, Duke of Anjou, Count of Provence and King of Sicily from 1447 to 1472. He is believed to be the author of remarkable illuminated manuscripts produced in the king's entourage, as well as designs for embroidery work and stained glass, and a small number of paintings.A masterwork, the Annunciation altarpiece is no doubt one of the key works of 15th century Provence. The sculptural handling of the draperies, the geometric shapes and the exemplary use of intense light betray the Mediterranean facet of the artist's culture. At the same time, the concern for detail, the love of and careful working of the materials, the shadows and the portrait-like realism of the prophet's face point more to the Flemish tradition. The painter succeeds in combining these two visions in a brilliant synthesis which was to profoundly influence Proven�al painting and to leave its lasting mark on many important workshops in southern France.

22436-lepanto.jpg	The Battle of Lepanto, the famous naval battle against the Turks, took place in 1571 and concluded with the victory of the Venetians and its allies over the enemies of Christianity, who seemed by now invincible in the eyes of all the European nations. The Ottoman Turks were defeated by the combined forces of Spain, Venice and the Papacy under the command of Don John of Austria. This decisive victory by the Holy League permanently destroyed Ottoman naval power in the Mediterranean.The intensity of the battle is palpable in the present depiction.

37949-intemper.jpg	Even today a 'Jan Steen household' is what the Dutch call a boisterous and ramshackle family. Jan Steen painted many such families, often including his own portrait as a pipe-smoking, beer-drinking, cheerful rake. His prolific output, during a career when he was constantly on the move from town to town, and the very high quality of much of his work, should make us beware of a literal interpretation of this raffish portrayal of the artist. One of the many Dutch seventeenth-century painters who remained Catholics, Steen is a moralist, but he relies on popular proverbs, the popular theatre and festive customs to preach through laughter at the human comedy: people like ourselves behaving as they shouldn't.Not all his paintings are of this kind. E.g. the landscapelike Skittle Players outside an Inn, which despite its subject seems to make no disparaging comment on the people taking their ease in the summer sunshine, or a late Two Men and a Young Woman making Music on a Terrace, which anticipates the eighteenth-century painter Watteau's lyrical and melancholy compositions. Steen also painted biblical and mythological subjects and portraits. While many of his pictures are small; the Effects of Intemperance is on a larger scale and demonstrates the broader touch he may have learned from Hals during his nine-year stay in Haarlem.The woman on the left is that most reprehensible creature, a Dutch housewife and mother who is not teaching her children virtue. She has slumped in drunken slumber, her clay pipe slipping from her hand. The little coal brazier by her side threatens to set fire to her gown, and her child is picking her pocket. Above her head hangs a basket in which the fate of those who grow up without parental guidance is foretold: it contains the crutch and clapper of the beggar and the birch of judicial punishment. Another child illustrates a Dutch proverb by throwing roses (we would say 'pearls') before swine, while the trio to the right waste a good meat pie by feeding it to a cat. The parrot, that mimic of human behaviour, is drinking wine given to him by the maid, as luxuriously dressed as her mistress and almost as tipsy, while in the arbour beyond a man, perhaps the father, is dallying with a buxom girl - 'wine is a mocker' indeed, as the saying goes.Just as the ancient painter Zeuxis painted grapes so realistically that birds came to peck at them, so may we, attracted by Steen's ravishing still life in the foreground, the glow of pewter and the shimmer of silks, be drawn to taste his wares. Through looking deep into his picture, we may yet reform our ways and so avoid the effects of intemperance

21625-charlott.jpg	The youngest of five children of somewhat improvident parents, Lawrence was an infant prodigy. At ten he was drawing profile likenesses of the clients of his father's inn at Devizes, and it was assumed early on that his talent for portraiture would support his family. Around 1787 he was brought to London by his father, began to paint in oils and to show at the Royal Academy. His fame as a painter of full-length portraits in oil was sealed at the Academy exhibition of 1790, which included, among a varied group of a dozen pictures by him, this masterly likeness of Queen Charlotte. Praised outside the royal family, the picture was never acquired by them, perhaps because the king was upset by the queen having posed bareheaded after Lawrence disliked the bonnet and hat she had chosen to wear. The queen herself found the 20-year old artist 'rather presuming' when he asked her to talk during the sitting, in an effort to animate her features. Eventually it was the Assistant Keeper of her Wardrobe who completed the sittings for such details as the bracelets bearing a portrait miniature of the king and his cipher.Lawrence, a draughtsman of extreme precision, worked very hard at the 'appearance of facility'. His dazzling brushwork, inspired by Rubens, Van Dyck, Rembrandt and Titian, enabled him to enjoy painting draperies, unlike his ageing 'rival' Reynolds, who often left them to assistants. But there is more to admire here beside the rustling shimmer of the queen's silks, gauzes and laces. Queen Charlotte had been shocked and saddened by the onset of George III's illness shortly before the portrait was painted. X-rays show that Lawrence modified the careworn expression which he had first observed. Yet even in the final portrait, so formal in conception, so grand in execution, something of the queen's malaise remains touchingly evident.The landscape background shows a view of Eton College as seen from Windsor Castle. The trees are turning red - as they might well have been in late September when the queen posed for Lawrence, but also so that the colour contrasts of carpet and dress may be echoed in the russet foliage against a blue sky. Although she cannot see the view behind her, the direction of the queen's glance draws our own eyes to these vivid yet melancholy harbingers of winter

42208-0107vela.jpg	Vel�zquez was a pupil in Pacheco's workshop when he embarked upon his first large work, The Adoration of the Magi. In his early works Vel�zquez was still strongly influenced by his master; these pictures also reveal a marked striving for plasticity in the figures and balance between the different elements of the composition. He painted The Adoration of the Magi in heavy, dark colours and his lack of experience is evident in the representation of the faces. The main characters are thought to be portraits: the young king is a free self-portrait of the artist, while the kneeling king behind him has the features of Pacheco and the Virgin Mary those of Pacheco's daughter Juana, married to Vel�zquez.And yet, the painting is more than a mere exercise by an industrious and talented pupil. It is true that he has not conveyed the quality of the textiles in his arrangement of the folds of the garments; the composition is somewhat uncertain and the spatial relations are by no means perfect: yet the picture reveals Vel�zquez's genius as a portraitist. The Madonna is depicted as a beautiful Andalusian peasant girl, her face glowing with maternal pride, the Infant is well observed, charming with no hint of idealization, and the features of Balthasar are exceptionally lifelike and worthy of note

The architecture, designed by the Venetian sculptor and architect Andriolo de' Santi was commissioned in 1372.The painting school of Padua can be ranked as the most vigorous of the northern Italian schools: the painters of Padua built upon Giotto's achievements. The prolific Paduan fresco painters added striking naturalistic observations of their own in landscape, in the painting of animals, and in portraiture. The most successful painters of the period came to Padua from outside - Jacopo Avanzi from Bologna and Altichiero da Zevio from Verona.

11628-madonna.jpg	Commissioned during the Holy Year of 1625 for Santi Giovanni e Petronio dei Bolognesi, the church of the Bolognese community in Rome, the large altarpiece was not delivered by the painter until 1629. Criticized by contemporaries for its reliance on fifteenth century structure and composition, the painting received glowing reviews from the eighteenth century neoclassicists Mengs and Canova. In 1812, during the Napoleonic upheavals, it was removed by the French to the Brera: it remained there until 1953 when it was returned to Rome.A masterpiece of Domenichino's maturity, it was carried out during the very years when the grand tradition of Bolognese painting was giving way before the insistence of the new and extremely vivacious baroque style. Here, to confirm the primacy of classicism in the face of this assault, Domenichino deliberately selected a compositional scheme that would renew ties to Renaissance motifs. Though these motifs had fallen into disuse during the second half of the sixteenth century, for Domenichino they were nothing less than the fundamental principles of painting. Influenced by the examples of the Venetian school, the artist forcefully reasserts the centrality of the Madonna and Child in the picture. He even quotes, quite literally, the form of Michelangelo's Bruges Madonna. By realizing a formidable synthesis between his various Renaissance models, the artist presented an exceptional manifesto of classical painting in the very years when this style was so strongly confronted in Rome by new baroque trends.In the painting it is possible to find important connections with Matteo Zaccolini da Cesena's contemporary theories on colour and perspective, cited by all the sources as significant but never precisely identified in a painting. Also, in the group of music making angels, we may recognize new reflections on trends in contemporary instrumental music

26581-05_3ce5.jpg	In response to the gesture and intense gaze of the Creator, Eve appears to rise from the rocks behind Adam rather than from his body, extending her joint hands. The bodies of the couple appear to be those of adolescents, in contrast to those depicted in the scene of the Fall and Expulsion. The figure of the Lord, wrapped in a voluminous violet mantle that only allows a glimpse of the red tunic he wears in the other scenes of the Creation, draws on an iconographic tradition dating back to Giotto and Masaccio, from which it is differentiated, however, by the blond hair and beard framing the face.The Creation of Woman is a design cast in simple, powerful form that contains a certain demonic element. The God and Demiurge, as conceived in the earlier medieval tradition, fills the space between heaven and earth as if about to erupt out of it, lifting his arms with an incantatory gesture and a supernatural air. More is indicated here than mere physical creation: it is the conception of the female mirror-image drawn forth from the sleeping Adam, who is fettered to a stunted tree shaped like the Staurus, the Egyptian cross. Is he the archetypal son destined to become the Mediator and endure the Passion? The composition forms a right-angled triangle with Adam as the horizontal and God the Father the vertical element, and Eve, in an attitude of adoration, striving towards the hand of God as a diagonal hypotenuse. Theirs is a harmonious Pythagorean unity of spirits prior to their separation. This astounding fresco dominating the centre of the entire vault links Ezekiel and the Sibyl of Cumae, thus underlining the importance of the grand design of the law of polarity

11636-st_agnes.jpg	The painting can be dated around 1620 on the evidence of style. Comparisons may be made with the two large altarpieces of the Madonna del Rosario and the Martyrdom of Saint Agnes, both in Bologna (Pinacoteca), although in terms of scale and the drawing of the putto, King David playing the Harp (Versailles) provides a more suitable juxtaposition. All these works appear to have been painted in Bologna before Domenichino returned to Rome for his third extended stay in 1621. The relationship between the Saint Agnes and the two large paintings in Bologna is confirmed by a drawing at Windsor Castle which has on the recto a study for the Madonna del Rosario and on the verso one for Saint Agnes.The painting is a fine example of what is known as Bolognese classicism, which evolved out of the late work of Annibale Carracci. Domenichino here combines harmonious colouring with purity of line. His ability as a landscape painter is only hinted at in the background of the composition. There is a certain resemblance between Saint Agnes and the figure of Saint Cecilia in the altarpiece of Saint Cecilia with Four Saints by Raphael, which was painted for a Bolognese patron. The flying angel may be borrowed from the Worship of Venus by Titian (Madrid, Prado), which was in the Aldobrandini collection in Rome at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The classical vase and the low relief on the left symbolise the pagan world which Saint Agnes rejected in favour of Christianity. The relief shows a sacrifice which is perhaps an allusion to the saints own martyrdom. The lamb held by the putto is the attribute of Saint Agnes. The uncovering of her remains in the church of Sant'Agnese fuori le mura in Rome in 1605 may have encouraged a revival of interest in her cult, of which this picture is almost certainly a product

11996-aeneas.jpg	Also commissioned by Alfonso d'Este for the Alabaster Chamber, this small canvas formed part of a series of ten paintings -- all of the same height and all by Ferrara's court artist Dosso Dossi and his brother Battista Dossi -- that ran continuously around the upper walls of the room, forming a frieze above the large canvases.The series depicted the adventures of the Trojan hero Aeneas, venerated in Italy since antiquity as a founder of the Roman state. Aeneas' wanderings around the Mediterranean after the sack of Troy and his rise to kingship in Italy were immortalized in The Aeneid, an epic poem written by Virgil (70-19 B.C.).Dosso's painting represents the episode when Aeneas and his friend Achates were shipwrecked off the coast of Libya and cast up at Carthage. The similarity of this picture's vivid green pigments to some of the repainted foliage in The Feast of the Gods implies that Dosso could have been responsible for the first alteration to Bellini's masterpiece

04024-2vajk.jpg	"""The Baptism of Vajk"" by Gyula Bencz�r won First Prize in competition Minister of Culture J�zsef E�tv�s announced with the purpose of promoting historical painting in Hungary. In the study prepared for the painting, which was eventually entered for the competition, a conspicuous group of pagan Hungarian was present. When the final picture was completed in 1875, there was no indication of the pagans, i.e. the opposition; after the political compromise between Hungary and Austria in 1867, those who financed the competition preferred a rendering of this decisive event without allusions to any conflicts. Vajk (the later King St. Stephen) is seen kneeling in the foreground, to be baptized by Saint Adalbert, dressed in ornate attire.With the help of his ability to paint pompous materials and set up vivid compositions - which he acquired from his master, Piloty, and by studying the art of Rubens and Tiepolo, Bencz�r created a representative tableau of Historicist painting. It is not without reason that Bencz�r became the king of painting in Hungary during this period, the favourite of rulers and the aristocracy; moreover, he became a professor at the Academy of Art in Munich and later at the Master's School in Budapest. He possessed both technical virtuosity and the ability to conform with the requirements of his patrons - two assets which were necessary for obtaining his position in art"

06272-venus_cu.jpg	This work was probably created at the Tuscan court of Duke Cosimo de' Medici for presentation to the King of France. It was designed as a puzzle, and incorporates symbols and devices from the worlds of mythology and emblematic imagery. It would have made the perfect present for the French king, known for his lusty appetites, yearning after Italian culture and magnificence, and with a liking for heraldry and obscure emblems.The goddess of love and beauty, identified by the golden apple given to her by Paris and by her doves, has drawn Cupid's arrow. At her feet, masks, perhaps the symbols of sensual nymph and satyr, seem to gaze up at the lovers. Foolish Pleasure, the laughing child, throws rose petals at them, heedless of the thorn piercing his right foot. Behind him Deceit, fair of face, but foul of body, proffers a sweet honeycomb in one hand, concealing the sting in her tail with the other. On the other side of the lovers is a dark figure, formerly called Jealousy but recently plausibly identified as the personification of Syphilis, a disease probably introduced to Europe from the New World and reaching epidemic proportions by 1500.The symbolic meaning of the central scene is thus revealed to be unchaste love, presided over by Pleasure and abetted by Deceit, and its painful consequences. Oblivion, the figure on the upper left who is shown without physical capacity for remembering, attempts to draw a veil over all, but is prevented by Father Time - possibly alluding to the delayed effects of syphilis. Cold as marble or enamel, the nudes are deployed against the costliest ultramarine blue, and the whole composition, flattened against the picture plane, recalls Bronzino's contemporaneous designs for the duke's new tapestry factories.

The paintings were removed from their original location in 180 and are now dispersed between the Academia Carrara, Bergamo, the Brera in Milan, and the Ca' d'Oro, Venice.In this painting in his representation of buildings and accessories, Carpaccio adopts a characteristic mixture of specific allusion and poetic imagination. The turbaned figures in the middleground, the displays of oriental rugs on the balconies, the palm trees, and the minaret-like towers in the left background, all reflect a widespread Venetian interest in the Near East in this period; and by including them, Carpaccio clearly also intended to evoke the specific flavour of the Holy Land

23865-4manet03.jpg	Manet is generally considered an important artist of the Realist tradition who influenced and was influenced by the Impressionist painters of the 1870s. He never exhibited with the Impressionists or adopted fully their ideas and procedures. His painting is famous for its painterly technique and his paintings and prints are known for new urban subject-matter. He had a short career, but his style evolved from early works characterized by dramatic light-dark contrasts and based on Spanish 17th-century painting to high-keyed, freely brushed compositions where the content was related to Symbolism

It shows the Adoration of the Magi with the Holy Family (The Virgin, Child and Joseph) on the right and the Magi on the left, one of them kneeling in prayer before the Virgin and Child.The kneeling magus may be a portrait of Ferdinand II of Aragon, King of Spain (1452-1516).

However, there is no doubt about Tintoretto's autograph authorship of the Prado painting, which was almost certainly painted at about the same time.Typical of Tintoretto throughout his carrer is the dramatic setting for the scene, the long diagonal vistas serving to transform the humble event into an apocalyptic vision.

The graceful wife bears the 25-year difference in age from her husband with the same dignity as he wears his 1814 medal. Moreover, the colours of the clothing are skillfully balanced: her black dress with its white collar is the inversion of his Habsburg uniform.

16660-stephen.jpg	Ever since Duccio's Maesta, Sienese painters had found in the two parts of the altarpiece - the large-scale icon, and the small narrative panels - quite different expressive possibilities. The predella was the territory of the contingent, of dramatic action unfolding in time, in the city street or across the landscape. Its scale was inherently humble, intimate; it became the natural location for that civic and vernacular imagery most characteristic of Sienese tradition. Giovanni di Paolo's main altarpieces nearly always present a Madonna in 'sacred conversation' with her attendant saints, offering very little opportunity for spatial and compositional play; after 1450, when the Florentine unbroken rectangular format became a dominant convention, they are seldom of much interest. His gifts are released, almost exclusively, in the predella. Giovanni di Paolo painted at least a hundred of these small narrative panels. His storytelling is entertaining, pungent, funny and compelling.St Stephen Suckled by a Doe is the opening scene of an outstandingly fine predella, added to a dull altarpiece of The Madonna with Saints (Bernardino and Jerome among them) painted some fifty years earlier by Andrea Vanni. It stood in a pilgrimage church on the outskirts of Siena, whose relics included one of the rocks with which St Stephen was stoned.A paved foreground with a steep street behind provides the setting for one of the strangest and most beautiful images Giovanni ever painted. Although the doors of the two facing palaces are open, the street is uncannily deserted. Into this spellbound, silent city has strayed the delicate grey doe, giving her milk to the infant Stephen, already haloed in his swaddling bands. The patterned pavement splays outwards, as though radiating from the semi-heraldic beast herself. Giovanni's colour is limited here almost entirely to white, black, pink and red

It is assumed that they once formed part of the decoration of a convent or chapel. In their original context, these flower-pieces are likely to have been regarded as images of the natural world that lifted up the spirits of viewers in praise of its Creator. The figures of excited cherubs bearing flowers and fruit that are embossed on the wide gilded bowls emphasise the religious message.The bowls are filled with a dense arrangement of flowers and the blooms occupy the pictorial field in a manner that is characteristic of De la Corte's compositional horror vacui in his flower paintings.

44263-protesta.jpg	Emanuel de Witte was born and trained in Alkmaar but had come to Delft by 1641 and joined the painters' guild there in the following year. He remained in Delft for ten years but it was only at the end of his stay in the town, around 1650, that he began to paint the church interiors which form the greater part of his work. With his two Delft contemporaries, Gerard Houckgeest and Hendrick van Vliet, he developed this new type of subject-matter for painting.They painted 'portraits' of the churches of Delft (and elsewhere), although they allowed themselves some leeway in the arrangement of individual architectural and other elements for compositional purposes. The tombs of the heroes of the Republic, notably those of Piet Hein in the Old Church and William the Silent in the New Church, were chosen as a patriotic focus for some of the compositions. Bright daylight, passing through the clear glass of the windows, illuminates the whitewashed interiors, with their tiled floors, memorial tablets and heraldic banners. Figures are glimpsed between the columns and in front of the tombs, not all of them treating their surroundings with appropriate reverence. In this painting the gravedigger pauses to gossip, while a man on the left sleeps, watched over by his dog. An aspect of his reserve is seen in his understated handling of the skull that is hardly visible in the shadowed debris of the open tomb.Houekgeest seems to have been the innovator in this group of artists but De Witte, the greatest painter of the three, softened the harsh linearity of Houckgeest's style. De Witte, unlike Houckgeest and Van Vliet, was a sensitive colourist, offsetting the severe black and white of the church interiors with patches of bright reds, yellows and greens. By January 1652 De Witte had moved to Amsterdam where he continued to specialize in church interiors.It is a surprise to learn that the Interior of a Church in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam (this picture) is one of de Witte's compilations and not a view of a known building. The wooden ceiling and the little organ on the left are based on what de Witte saw at the Old Church in Amsterdam, the massive columns - but not their capitals - were modeled after the huge piers at St Bavo in Haarlem. The round arches and the late afternoon sunlight, which glows through the building, are purely imaginary. Distances are still clear, yet darkness will soon fall over this articulated  play of forms. And de Witte not only could create majestic church interiors giving the convincing impression of reality; he also endowed them with a profound personal mood. His tonal design organizes the picture plane in a slightly geometrical fashion and substantially contributes to the articulation of the spatial effect. The movements and gestures of his figures are appropriate to the silence suggested by his dark interiors

30757-2famous.jpg	Each of the two compartments (lunettes) on the left wall presents a row of six figures standing in front of a low landscape horizon. Above these, personifications of the four cardinal virtues sit enthroned on clouds, two in each lunette. Beside each of the Virtues is an ornamental inscription tablet flanked by putti and containing a Latin distich identifying her and celebrating the exemplars below. Each trio of figures is made up of two Romans and one Greek; their names appear on the ground beneath their feet.The represented famous men in the first compartment are Fabius Maximus, Socrates, Numa Pompilius, Furius Camillus, Pittacus, and Trajan. Above them the Cardinal Virtues Prudentia and Justitia are depicted. At the right we can see Perugino's self-portrait.For his arrangement of the heroes in the lunettes, Perugino borrowed from Ghirlandaio's paintings  in the Sala dei Gigli in Florence's Palazzo Vecchio. More than likely he knew those works firsthand, for he had himself been commissioned to execute some of the paintings in that room in 1482.The combination of ancient heroes with personifications of Virtues was prefigured in the cycle of paintings by Taddeo di Bartolo for the antechapel of the Palazzo Pubblico, Siena

35393-03erect5.jpg	Rubens painted the triptych for the high altar of Antwerp's church of St Walpurgis, which was demolished in 1817. That explains the inclusion of Amand, Walpurgis and Eligius on the back side of the wings. According to tradition, Bishop Amand founded that church - Antwerp's first - some time around 650. He features on the outside of the wings in the company of Walpurgis, a 8th-century saint, who supposedly lived for several years as a hermitess in the church's crypt, before becoming abbess of the convent she founded in Bavaria. In the right shutter, Rubens placed St Eligius, the blacksmith and bishop. Eligius was the patron saint of Antwerp's blacksmiths, who had their altar at St Walpurgis. Catherine of Alexandria stands in front of him with her martyr's sword and palm branch. The prominent position she is given in the altarpiece no doubt had something to do with a special devotion in the church, perhaps a confraternity of St Catherine, of which, however, no details are known

07917-laughing.jpg	Capturing a moment of laughter in painting is not an easy task, but the young Annibale Carracci succeeds in his sketchy portrait of a Laughing Youth, dating from circa 1583. Though this is a small work its spontaneity is extraordinarily modern and anticipates the portraits by Bernini and Vel�zquez fifty years later. Carraci's interest in caricature is well known, but here he seeks to capture the boy's expression as it is in real life. This is a portrait of an actor, as can be seen from the hat, which was used for the Bolognese mask of the `doctor'.

42546-05sleep.jpg	Signature: Signed on the upper left.Provenance: It may be identical with A Drunken Sleeping Maid at a Table, which was sold at the Amsterdam sale of 1696 under no. 8 for 62 guilders. In the nineteenth century, it passed through the hands of several Parisian collectors and dealers. Acquired by Benjamin Altman, New York, between 1907 and 1909, and bequeathed by him to the museum in 1913.This painting is the earliest indisputable work by the master. Vermeer's earliest phase was Rembrandtesque. This can easily be ascertained from the rich and heavily impastoed pigments used in this painting. His subjects are always deceptively simple. He shows us in the left part of the composition a table covered with a glowing Oriental rug pulled up in front. On it is a Delftware plate with fruit, a white pitcher, and an overturned glass or roemer in the foreground. At the far end of the table is a young woman asleep, her head resting on her propped-up right arm and hand; the left one lies negligently flat. To the right is the back of a chair, and in the distance a half-open door that allows the viewer to see into another room.The theme goes directly back to Rembrandt. One of his drawings, A Girl Asleep at a Window, at the Tuffier Collection, Paris, shows a very similar pose. This, and the type of model, were also adopted by Nicolaes Maes in his Idle Servant, dated 1655, at the National Gallery, London, although there the maid sleeps on her left arm and hand. An identical stance can also be found in Maes's Housekeeper from a year later, 1656, at the art museum of Saint Louis. It has been suggested that Nicolaes Maes stayed in Delft after having left Rembrandt's studio, perhaps in 1653 or even later, to move to Dordrecht afterward. In any event, there were ample possibilities for Vermeer to have had access to Rembrandtesque drawings, from a possible stay in the Rembrandt studio to Leonard Bramer and Carel Fabritius. The handling of the light, as well as the deep colouring and heavy paste in the execution, derives from Rembrandtesque techniques of the early 1640s.Technical examinations revealed that Vermeer made major changes in the course of execution. Thus, he initially put a man in the second room instead of the mirror, and a dog in the doorway. He also enlarged the picture on the wall, which shows part of a Cupid in the style of Caesar van Everdingen, which we shall encounter in toto in other of Vermeer's paintings. There have been various attempts at emblematic interpretation of the scene, but unless we have a clear case of double meaning, such as we shall encounter in a few isolated instances, this type of interpretation has to be taken with a grain of salt.The paint surface of the still life on the table has suffered from abrasions and restorations

24444-theo_pet.jpg	"This scene illustrates the miracle that Peter performed after he was released from prison, thanks to Paul's intercession. According to the account in the Golden Legend, once out of prison, Peter was taken to the tomb of the son of Theophilus, Prefect of Antioch. Here St Peter immediately resurrected the young man who had been dead for fourteen years. As a result, Theophilus, the entire population of Antioch and many others were converted to the faith; they built a magnificent church and in the centre of the church a chair for Peter, so that he could sit during his sermons and be heard and seen by all. Peter sat in the chair for seven years; then he went to Rome and for twenty-five years sat on the papal throne, the cathedra, in Rome.Masaccio sets the scene in a contemporary church, with contemporary ecclesiastical figures (actually the Carmelite friars from Santa Maria del Carmine) and a congregation that includes a self-portrait and portraits of Masolino, Leon Battista Alberti, Brunelleschi.Vasari, in his Life of Masaccio, mentions the work of Filippino, but later chroniclers refer to all the frescoes in the chapel as by Masaccio. In the 19th century it was once again pointed out the work of Filippino, distinguishing it from that of Masaccio; and since then critics have been in almost total agreement with his theory.Scholars have suggested that Filippino was commissioned to complete the work that Masaccio had left unfinished or to repair sections which been damaged or destroyed because they depicted characters that were enemies of the Medici, like the Brancacci. There is no doubt that the Brancacci family was subjected to something similar to a ""damnatio memoriae"" after they had been declared enemies of the people and exiled.Vasari had already identified a number of contemporary figures in those painted by Filippino: the resurrected youth was supposedly a portrait of the painter Francesco Granacci, at that time hardly more than a boy; ""and also the knight Messer Tommaso Soderini, Piero Guicciardini, the father of Messer Francesco who wrote the Histories, Piero del Pugliese and the poet Luigi Pulci.""Studies of the possible portraits and of the iconography of the fresco confirmed the identifications made by Vasari and suggests others, presumably already planned in Masaccio's original sinopia, indicating that the fresco was intended to convey a political message: the Carmelite monk is a portrait of Cardinal Branda Castiglione; Theophilus is Gian Galeazzo Visconti; the man sitting at Theophilus's feet is Coluccio Salutati. And the four men standing at the far right are, starting from the right, Brunelleschi, Leon Battista Alberti, Masaccio and Masolino"

Francesco of the Minorities at Citt&#224; di Castello. In 1798 the town was forced to donate the painting to General Lechi, a Napoleonic army officer, who sold it to the Milanese art dealer, Sannazzari. Sannazzari bequeathed it to the main hospital of Milan in 1804. Two years later it was acquired by the Academy of Fine Arts and was then exhibited at the Brera.Critics believe the painting to be inspired by two compositions by Perugino: the celebrated Christ Delivering the Keys to St Peter from the fresco cycle in the Sistine Chapel and a panel containing the Marriage of the Virgin now in the Museum of Ca&#235;n.By painting his name and the date, 1504, in the frieze of the temple in the distance, Raphael abandoned anonymity and confidently announced himself as the creator of the work. The main figures stand in the foreground: Joseph is solemnly placing the ring on the Virgin's finger, and holding the flowering staff, the symbol that he is the chosen one, in his left hand. His wooden staff has blossomed, while those of the other suitors have remained dry. Two of the suitors, disappointed, are breaking their staffs.The polygonal temple in the style of Bramante establishes and dominates the structure of this composition, determining the arrangement of the foreground group and of the other figures. In keeping with the perspective recession shown in the pavement and in the angles of the portico, the figures diminish proportionately in size. The temple in fact is the centre of a radial system composed of the steps, portico, buttresses and drum, and extended by the pavement. In the doorway looking through the building and the arcade framing the sky on either side, there is the suggestion that the radiating system continues on the other side, away from the spectator.Caught at the culminating moment of the ceremony, the group attending the wedding also repeats the circular rhythm of the composition. The three principal figures and two members of the party are set in the foreground, while the others are arranged in depth, moving progressively farther away from the central axis. This axis, marked by the ring Joseph is about to put on the Virgin's finger, divides the paved surface and the temple into two symmetrical parts.A tawny gold tonality prevails in the colour scheme, with passages of pale ivory, yellow, blue-green, dark brown and bright red. The shining forms appear to be immersed in a crystalline atmosphere, whose essence is the light blue sky.The structure of Raphael's painting, which includes figures in the foreground and a centralized building in the background, can certainly be compared to the two Perugino paintings. But Raphael's painting features a well developed circular composition, while that of Perugino is developed horizontally, in a way still characteristic of the Quattrocento. The structure of the figure group and of the large polygonal building clearly distinguish Raphael's painting from that of his master. The space is more open in Raphael's composition, indicating a command of perspective which is superior to Perugino's"

13415-21paele0.jpg	"Here the visual and thematic elements are similar to those of the Chancellor Rolin Madonna. Van Eyck is concerned with showing the presence of a vision and therefore of illustrating the reality of God in our world. Just as Nicolas Rolin is shown in his palace, in the midst of an identifiable environment that seems to make his vision of the Virgin all the more real, so Canon van der Paele is shown in the choir of the collegiate church of St. Donatian in Bruges, where he is being presented to the Virgin by St. George and St. Donatian. Hans Belting is of the opinion that this picture once hung in the choir of the now destroyed church. This would mean that the depicted location mirrored the real location. Van der Paele would therefore have been able to see himself in the very place of his depicted vision and so ""prove"" to the world at large the reality of his divine experience.The exquisite brocades, furs, and silks are shown in an extraordinarily lifelike and brilliant way, a way that confirms their reality, their tangibility. On the other hand, the reliefs and sculptures on the capitals in the background and on the Virgin's throne all allude to Christ's salvation of humanity. The depictions on the throne of Adam and Eve, Cain killing Abel, and Samson fighting the lion, together with the depiction on the capitals of Abraham sacrificing Isaac, create an Old Testament framework which allows the observer to reflect on the mercy of God, who sent his son, Christ the Redeemer, into the world. Redemption from sin (Cain killing his brother) is possible only through the power of faith (Samson overpowering the lion). The goodness and grace of God ""at the moment of truth"" (Abraham sacrificing Isaac) serves as proof of the redeeming power and presence of servants of God both celestial (St. George) and mortal (Canon van der Paele).This is how van der Paele might have expressed the message of the painting-that paradise was at hand-a message confirmed by its being set in a very real but also sacred context. The Virgin is pictures holding a nosegay and her son a parrot - unmistakable echoes of the Garden of Eden - and both figures have turned to face the meditating canon"

11314-502delac.jpg	"The success of the Apollo had taken Delacroix somewhat unaware; he was not used to a favourable critical consensus. He made the most of it by applying for and obtaining the commission to decorate one of the Salons of the new Hotel de Ville. This was to be his last work of non-religious monumental painting. It is also the only one not to have survived; it perished when the town hall burnt down during the Commune in 1871. Of the two Salons of this new building, the north facing Salon de la Paix fell to Delacroix; the south salon was commissioned from Ingres. We know little about Delacroix's scheme of decoration, only that it took him two years of what he described as ""titanic"" labours. We also know that the room was very badly illuminated and that he had to rework the tonality of his entire composition.All that remains today are some sketches and a certain number of preparatory drawings. The ceiling was to have been occupied by a huge allegory. Peace Descends to Earth, of which nothing has survived but a sketch"

44119-balcony.jpg	Whistler regarded painting as simply an exercise in colour variations - to the point where he gave his compositions titles that evoke only the dominant colour notes. Whistler originally dated The Balcony 1865, before replacing the traditional signature with a rectangular cartouche featuring a butterfly (a kind of naturalistic stylisation of his own initials), the cartouche idea being very obviously borrowed from those used by Japanese printmakers. Whistler was in fact one of the earliest enthusiasts of Japanese art.In The Balcony, Whistler turned the view from his balcony overlooking the River Thames into a sort of Japanese fairy tale by placing several young women dressed in Japanese costume in poses directly inspired by those found in the prints of Utagawa Kunisada and Katsushika Hokusai, almost contemporary Japanese artists whose works were the first to reach the West

00569-polyptic.jpg	Unlike Bartolomeo Vivarini, the early works of Andrea da Murano display the fullness of sculptural form and clarity of spatial structure which we note in the works of Giovanni Bellini. His masterpiece of this period is the polyptych, originally in the church of St Peter Martyr of Murano.Although conceived according to the traditional dividing up into compartments, with St Vincent Ferrer and St Roch in the centre, St Sebastian on the left, St Peter the Martyr on the right, and in the lunette the Madonna of Mercy with St Louis, St Dominic, St Bernardino and St Catherine, the palimpsest acquires a wholeness of vision through his confident mastery of perspective. Masters of the space within which they stand naturally on the gold ground, the figures have both a sculptural and a spiritual quality. In the three compartments, St Sebastian stands transfixed gazing sorrowfully upwards while the other saints motion benignly and reassuringly towards the devotees.The work was probably painted after an outbreak of plague, perhaps the one in 1478, as the saints in the lower register suggest. All were venerated for their miraculous powers against epidemics.The paintings in the lower register were transferred to canvas, the lunette remains on panel. The polyptych is signed lower centre: OPUS.ANDRAE.DE.MURIANO

14449-213fried.jpg	After his marriage in 1818 people assume a more prominent role in Friedrich's pictures and become considerably larger. Figures also appear more frequently in pairs closely bound by friendship or love, etching themselves forever on the memory in images of supreme potency. One of the most beautiful examples of such paintings of two figures is Two Men Contemplating the Moon.In this ethereal painting, human and natural symbolism are subtly interwoven. The moon, an old Christian sign of hope, gleams from behind a withered tree, watched by two men, perhaps the artist and a pupil, in the 'old German' costume favoured by the resistance movement during the years of Napoleonic occupation. Painted after this threat had lifted, the picture links past, present and future through the cycles of time and season and the intercession of their human observers.In response to demand from his clientele, Friedrich executed several copies of this composition, a number of which remain in private collection. He took up the motif again, in slightly varied form, in the painting Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon (c. 1824, Nationalgalerie, Berlin), in which he has perhaps portrayed himself and his wife in this scene of Romantic wonderment.

33462-25oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 531.Biblical subject. King David captivated by Uriah's wife sends him to the war. In a letter to his chieftain, which he handed to him, he orders Uriah to be sent to the most dangerous place in the battle. According to another interpretation the painting represents Haman Recognizes His Fate.Rembrandt's biblical canvases show a search for ways to present the time of the action through the means of painting. From wild Baroque gesticulation he gradually moves to focus on the main elements: composition, lighting, and colour. The bloody crimson cloak, the flashes of light on the protagonist's face and hands. and his forward inclination enable us to sense the approach of his life's dramatic end. Whoever he is, he is directed by divine providence that is indifferent to the fate of the individual yet elevates him as a particle of the Deity

The Romans worshipped her as a triple deity, Luna (the sky), Diana (the earth), Hecate (the underworld). According to myth she was the daughter of Jupiter and Latona (Leto), and the twin sister of Apollo.Endymion, the beautiful youth who fell into an eternal sleep, has captured the imagination of poets and artists as a symbol of timelessness of beauty that is a 'joy forever.' Endymion, sent to sleep for ever by the command of Jupiter, in return for being granted perpetual youth, was visited nightly by the goddess.

37283-1pisa.jpg	"In 1319 a polyptych was commissoned for the convent of Santa Caterina in Pisa. This polyptych, now in the Museum of San Matteo, is without doubt the most important and grand of Simone's signed paintings: forty-three busts of apostles, martyrs, bishops and prophets are placed in the cusps and under the trefoiled arches of the panels. The altarpiece consists of seven elements, each one in three parts: a cusp, a smaller panel divided into two sections, and a larger panel depicting a single saint. There is also a predella consisting of seven smaller size panels.Over the centuries the polyptych has been reconstructed according to many different theories, but presently it is arranged as follows: in the cusps, next to the Blessing Redeemer, we find David playing the harp, Moses with the Tables of the Law and the prophets Jeremiah, Isaiah, Daniel and Ezechiel. On the level below, on either side of the Archangels Gabriel and Michael in the middle, we find the apostles, arranged in pairs below trefoiled arches: each one is carrying a copy of the Gospel and is identified by an inscription on the gold background. From left to right, Thaddaeus, Simon, Philip and James the Less, who are talking animatedly about the Scriptures; they are followed by Andrew and Peter.Then, on the other side of the archangels, Paul and James Major (a shell in relief has been placed between the letters of his name); Matthew writing his Gospel, resting the book on the frame of the panel, together with Bartholomew, followed by Thomas and Mathias. On the middle level, together with Mary Magdalene, St Dominic, John the Evangelist, the Madonna and Child (and above the frame there is the inscription ""Symon de Senis me pinxit""), and John the Baptist, we find Peter Martyr and Catherine of Alexandria.The reconstruction of the predella, on the other hand, is much more certain. It revolves around the central panel where the Man of Sorrows is assisted by the Virgin and St Mark. At the sides, from left to right, we find Saints Stephen and Apollonia, Jerome and Lucy (?), Gregory and Luke, Thomas Aquinas and Augustine, Agnes and Ambrose, Ursula and Lawrence.With a composition so full of movement, the Pisa Polyptych is extremely innovative, especially in its structure. The seven elements, the predella panels and the ones on the upper level, each consisting of two sections, not only allow the artist to include a vast number of characters, but they also allow him to describe each one with a wealth of iconographical details. For this reason, alongside characters who would traditionally be included in any polyptych, we also find figures connected to the religious Order who commissioned the altarpiece: Jerome, Gregory and Augustine as well as more recently canonized saints, such as the founder of the Order, Dominic, and Peter Martyr. Notice that Thomas Aquinas is portrayed with a halo, whereas he was not actually canonized until 1323.There is a wide range of different connections between the various characters, although they are all portrayed here as part of a vast propaganda programme, aimed at spreading the ideological message of the Dominicans. Just one example. Preaching is the primary activity of all the monks portrayed; scrolls, parchments, books (half hidden, half open, fully open like the text Thomas Aquinas is holding, very small ones like the one of the Child) are a subtle reference to the evangelizing mission of this Order. In all, there are 27 books in this polyptych.Simone's absolute mastery of volumes and shapes, obtained thanks both to Duccio's chiaroscuro technique and to his own recent experience in Assisi, is here blended with a very fluent use of vertical lines, of subtle and elegant modelling. The Gothic mood that Simone is here interpreting in terms of light, with a wide range of bright colours, creates a new relationship between image and space, between each individual measurement and the proportions of the whole composition"

34254-aesculap.jpg	After a long period of study of the greatest figures of late seventeenth century Italian painting, from Pietro da Cortona and Baciccio in Rome to the Carracci in Bologna, Luca Giordano in Florence and Magnasco in Milan, Sebastiano Ricci achieved a voice of his own characterized by a sparklingly fluent Rococo brilliance which was to gain the artist acceptance in London (1712-1716), and Paris (1716). Especially in paintings of small dimensions Sebastiano Ricci freed himself from all trace of his complex artistic training. Thus in the Dream of Aesculapius every detail of the bed chamber is rendered in the dancing rhythm of his line and the free and easy pictorial style. In the subdued glow of the setting, the scene seems like an animated ballet, fixed for ever in the wonder of bright, spirited colour

39907-allegory.jpg	When the unusual combination of objects and inscription on this still-life is deciphered we learn that the tondo is an allegorical still-life intended to advertise the virtue of Temperance. The still-life, Torrentius's only known painting, depicts a huge, half-full 'roemer' (a glass used for drinking wine) between a long-spouted water flagon and a wine jug, with a horse's bridle above them. On the ledge there are two  small clay pipes. The inscription on the sheet of music under the glass reads: 'That which exists out of measure perishes in evil immeasurably'. To the initiated, the implication is clear. Overindulgence in drinking or smoking tobacco (an intoxicant recently introduced from the New World) should be curbed. Hence the horse's bridle, and the water flagon and wine jug that flank the roemer, for if wine is diluted with water its intoxicating effect is tempered

37374-moret4.jpg	Sisley's motifs and view of Nature placed him too plainly as an emulator of Monet, and he had no material distinctly his own that could have asserted his own individuality. This became most apparent when in 1893-94, parallel to Monet's Rouen cathedral series, he painted about 15 views of the church at Moret. Like all Sisley's later works, they are firmly painted, and evidently aim to give a rather ordinary sense of the appearance of the building instead of the veils of light and colour impressions Monet registered when looking at his cathedral. Sisley's work focussed on the thing seen, but art was evolving towards a more subjective emphasis on configurations of colours and shapes. Monet's cathedrals were already fetching 15,000 francs at that time, while in 1896, when one of Sisley's church views was resold, it was for a mere 305 francs

12069-vertumnu.jpg	Pomona, the classical goddess of fruit, and Vertumnus, the god of transformation, are the main figures in an episode in Ovid's Metamorphoses which is depicted here. Vertumnus enters Pomona's grove in order to convince her of his love. Because she had always run away on previous occasions when he came, he has cunningly dressed as an old woman on this occasion. By telling her about the allegory of the grapevine and elm, he is able to convince her of the importance of togetherness, for the grapevine needs something it can climb up and the elm, when considered on its own, is useless. Persuaded, Pomona gives in to love and her innermost longings and they become a couple

26373-versaill.jpg	The Ch&#226;teau de Versailles, a 17th-century palace built by Louis XIV, was the principal residence of the kings of France and the seat of the government for more than 100 years. The first scenes of the French Revolution were also enacted at the palace, whose gardens, the masterpiece of Andr� Le N�tre, have become part of the national heritage of France and one of the most visited historic sites in Europe. Although it was a place of entertainment, the grandiose palace was also well equipped as a centre of government. Of about 20,000 persons attached to the court, some 1,000 courtiers with 4,000 attendants lived in the palace itself. About 14,000 soldiers and servants were quartered in annexes and in the town, which was founded in 1671 and had 30,000 inhabitants when Louis XIV died in 1715.The palace of Versailles led to the French court style in interior decoration and furnishings. Versailles was intended to be the outward and visible expression of the glory of France, and of Louis XIV, then Europe's most powerful monarch. His finance minister, Colbert, set up a manufactory that made works of art of all kinds, from furniture to jewellery, for interior decoration. A large export trade took French styles to almost every corner of Europe, made France a centre for luxuries, and gave to Paris an influence that has lasted till the present day. The vast initial cost of Versailles has been more than recouped since its completion. Even Louis XIV's most violent enemies imitated the decoration of his palace at Versailles. In 1667 Charles Le Brun was appointed director of the Gobelins factory, which had been bought by the King, and Le Brun himself prepared designs for various objects, from the painted ceilings of the Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors) at Versailles to the metal hardware for a door lock

36857-river_va.jpg	Hercules Seghers is best known today as an innovative printmaker. In the most recent catalogue 54 etchings are listed, with only 183 impressions in all: this unusually small number was a consequence of Seghers's unconventional and painstaking working procedure. He regarded each impression as a unique work of art, often printing impressions on rare papers and fabrics (including silk). According to the painter-critic Samuel van Hoogstraten, Seghers 'printed ... paintings'. There are relatively few paintings by Seghers. There are four (or possibly five) signed pictures and a group of others which can be assigned to him with confidence on the basis of comparison with these and the etchings.In this painting of about 1625 Seghers combined views familiar to him in an imaginary setting. The landscape was formerly identified as the valley of the River Maas (Meuse) and while it is not topographically accurate, it is probably based on his memories (presumably recorded in the form of sketches) of a trip along the Maas where high, rocky mountains can be found rising from the flat meadows bordering the river. The houses in the foreground are those which Seghers saw from the window of his house on the Lindengracht in Amsterdam: it was a view which the artist etched. The placing of actual buildings into an imaginary landscape was not peculiar to Seghers: other seventeenth-century Dutch artists, among them Salomon van Ruysdael, Jan van Goyen and Aelbert Cuyp, also transposed well-known structures into an invented setting.Seghers worked in Amsterdam but is recorded towards the end of his life in both Utrecht and The Hague. He seems to have enjoyed little contemporary success and is cited by van Hoogstraten as an example of an artist who was treated badly by fortune and whose true worth was discovered only after his death. He related that Seghers, despairing of ever achieving success, took to drink and died after falling downstairs while drunk. His exact date of death is unknown: he is last recorded living in The Hague, active as an art dealer, in January 1633

03304-predell1.jpg	In 1485 Domenico Ghirlandaio received the commission for the Adoration of the Magi for the main altar in the church of the Spedale degli Innocenti. The prior of the church, Tesori, also commissioned the predella with stories of the Virgin and the great cornice of the altarpiece. The latter had been executed by the carpenter Francesco Bartolo on designs by Giuliano da Sangallo, while the scenes of the predella are the work of one of Ghirlandaio's pupils, Bartolomeo di Giovanni; this is confirmed by the records and the workmanship of the fine, slender figures which are characteristic of him.The predella, with the Martyrdom of St John the Evangelist, the Annunciation, the Marriage of the Virgin, the Deposition, the Presentation in the Temple, the Baptism of Christ, the Consecration of the Church of the Innocenti, had been dismembered at the time of the restoration of the great altar (1615). In the 19th century the seven panels were in the Sala delle Adunanze. Later they were reunited with the painting, which was now devoid of Sangallo's fine cornice that was destroyed in the restoration of 1786.The picture shows one of the seven predella paintings

29294-303muril.jpg	The room is so dark that we can hardly make out the objects in it: beneath the little window aperture stands a rough-hewn wooden table, on which there is an earthenware jug and a white cloth. Another earthenware jug stands on the floor. At the right-hand edge of the painting, we see a spindle and distaff on a stool. The old woman who has just set them aside is now crouching down to look for lice in the little boy's hair. He is sitting on the floor, leaning against her knee and petting a little dog that is begging for a piece of the bread the boy is stuffing into his mouth. Both figures are very poorly dressed, and the few details of the room further emphasize the impression of poverty.Murillo is probably the only Baroque painter of rank to have portrayed poverty with such kind and conciliatory traits. There is no sign here of the wealthy man's notion of the picturesque simple life, so frecquently found in this genre. Murillo chooses the colours of the earth. The earthenware dishes, the stones of the wall, the wood of the furniture, the faces and clothes of the two figures, all are united by this warm colouring which seems so natural that it does not even raise the question of poverty or wealth, happiness or unhappiness

39018-3ceilin.jpg	The picture shows an overall view of the ceiling, photographed from below.The perspectival distortion at the edges of the overall view of the ceiling fresco tell us that this was never intended as a vantage point for the visitor. Instead, the fresco was to open out to the viewer as he ascended the staircase. Apollo is portrayed in the centre of the heavens, Venus and Mars rest on a cloud below him, while the zodiac appears on a band behind them with the four seasons to the left. The Horae can be recognized by their butterfly wings. The upper part of the fresco is meant to be viewed from the opposite angle and shows Mercury and, a little below him, the gods Diana, Jupiter and Saturn.The composition of the ceiling fresco takes into account the many viewpoints available to the visitor, who changes direction several times during his climb up the stairs, and who cannot take in the whole fresco at a glance.Tiepolo's achievements in composing this fresco are twofold: he takes into consideration the way in which only parts of the fresco are visible to the viewer as he climbs, and he presents independent pieces which nevertheless fuse into a harmonic whole. From the foot of the stairs the viewer first sees the continent of America, whose personification points with outstretched arm to a banner showing the mythical creature the griffin, a first allusion to the client. On entering the stairwell, a wider picture is revealed, giving a view of the dramatic cloud formations which push open the skies, and of the figure of Apollo, bathed in radiant light. Halfway up the first flight of stairs, more of the long sides of the fresco are revealed, with Africa on the right and Asia on the left. The groups of figures await the visitor almost like a court society. After this first flight, the viewer must change direction and now sees the portrayal of Europe for the first time on the short side opposite. The flourishing arts are symbolized here, partly personified by the artists involved in the construction of the Residence. Above them, the Prince-Bishop's portrait medallion is borne aloft through the heavens by geni and allegorical figures. Like Apollo, who cannot be seen from here, it too lets its light shine forth over the world.In comparison to the other Continents, the Europa fresco is statically conceived. This, and the sometimes frontal arrangement of its figures, causes the viewer to pause and so constitutes a first high point on the way to the Imperial Hall. The fresco was, therefore, never laid out with an overall view in mind, and the criticisms of the largely empty areas of sky at its centre which were later to be frequently voiced, are thus unfounded. Instead we are captivated by the harmonic perfection through which both architecture and painted decoration serve the same purpose: the magnificent staging of the ceremonial path through the Residence

09492-p_woman.jpg	The French Renaissance was much assisted by the Italian enthusiasm of King Francis I (r. 1515-47), who during three invasions of the peninsula established contacts with artists and poets; it expressed itself primarily in a blossoming portrait painting. Young aristocrats increasingly commissioned likenesses of their sweethearts, demanding that artists observe not so  much upper-class decorum as vivid naturalness. The miniature portraits of Corneille de Lyon, a native of The Hague, illustrate this tendency.The sitter of this portrait was probably Marquise de Rothelin or Fran�oise de Longwy-Givry

37229-00view3.jpg	The picture shows the west wall of the chapel. The scenes are: Miraculous Mass (scene 7, above left), Miracle of Fire (scene 8, above right), St Martin is Knighted (scene 3, below left), and St Martin Renounces his Weapons (scene 4, below right).The pictorial program of the chapel interior  includes ten scenes from the life of St martin, essentially based on the Golden Legend. All of the scenes are dominated by a calm, restrained, almost gentle narrative tone. There is no lack of genrelike elements, , far more powerful than these, however, are echoes of a courtly milieu, which are expressed openly in the penchant for chivalric motifs. The faces are usually very realistic, displaying a broad spectrum of physiognomic characterization and lively expression.

29502-washing.jpg	Van der Neer has infused this panel with a rarefied level of elegance and refinement seldom witnessed in Dutch genre painting. A classicising feature is the richly ornamented mantelpiece with Corinthian columns. The painter renders a tempestuous exchange between background figures in an emotionally charged manner as a maid forcefully prevents a young man from approaching her unkempt mistress. This background, stage-like scene amplifies the action of the sartorially splendid lady in the foreground, who washes her hands with the assistance of a boy dressed in a French pages outfit, holding a sumptuous silver basin and ewer.

25097-0st_lucy.jpg	The three episodes from the life of St Lucy which are depicted here are based on the account in the Legenda Aurea (thirteenth century).

Then Lucy was brought before the consul by her fianc� and on account of her faith she was condemned to prostitution (second scene).

20104-30hooch.jpg	Pieter de Hooch has gone down in art history as a painter who rendered Dutch domestic life with great precision. The private everyday life of the bourgeoisie in all its ordered tranquility, a world whose calm is never shattered by any sensational event, is the subject of his works. De Hooch opens a window on narrow alleyways, small gardens and courtyards, and gives us a glimpse into the antechambers and living-rooms of the Dutch citizens. Like Jan Vermeer, de Hooch specialized in the portrayal of interiors.Yet, whereas the paintings of Vermeer tend to be dominated by a self-absorbed figure pausing momentarily in some activity, de Hooch's paintings are dominated by the room itself, by its perspectives and views through doors and windows where people become an integral part of the interior. Light is an important factor, especially daylight, as in the work of Vermeer, with its refractions and reflections adding vitality to the rooms. Whereas people and animals interpose in their activities, light itself becomes the active element, permeating and moving over walls, floors and tiles, illuminating objects or casting them in shadow.Like Vermeer, de Hooch also draws upon religious paintings, translating them into scenes of everyday life. His painting of the housewife and her maid cleaning fish in a neat backyard, for example, recalls the topos of the Virgin Mary in the hortus conclusus. Rooms flooded with light take on aspects of the Annunciation or recall Jan van Eyck's Madonna in a Church Interior, lit by stained glass windows

20074-10granid.jpg	This painting was commissioned by Stadholder Frederik Hendrik for his residence at Honselaerdijk as one of a series of paintings on pastoral themes.Granida and Daifilo were lovers from the Dutch pastoral play Granida (1605) by Pieter Hooft. Granida, the daughter of an eastern king, betrothed to Prince Tisiphernes, lost her way while out hunting. She came upon a shepherd Daifilo and his mistress Dorilea who had just quarrelled. Daifilo fetched water for the princess to drink and fell in love with her. He followed her to court and, after several turns in the story, they fled to the woods together to live a pastoral life. Daifilo was taken prisoner by one of Granida's several suitors. They were finally reunited after the intervention of Tisiphernes who yielded his claim to her. The play set a fashion for pastoral idyll in the Netherlands and long remained popular.In Van Honthorst's representation the lovers are depicted in a woodland setting, with the suitor and soldiers approaching to arrest Daifilo

32252-04helios.jpg	In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. (To the Greeks the nature and functions of Apollo and Helios were distinct and separate. Apollo's identification with the sun was a later development, and was particularly associated with his cult in Roman times.) Helios drove his chariot daily across the sky. His golden chariot is a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast.Ovid tells of the palace of Helios and his retinue - Day, Month, Year, the Four Seasons and so  on. Here Phaethon presented himself and persuaded an unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. The Hours yoked the team of four horses to the golden car, Dawn threw open her doors, and Phaethon was off. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus. He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.On the painting the sun-god, having Apollo's appearance and attributes, sits on a cloudy throne framed in the zodiacal belt, a lyre beside him; Phaethon kneels in front of him.

35707-jewish.jpg	Ruins sometimes play a prominent role, and gloomy skies set a melancholy mood. Ruisdael's rare ability to create a compelling and tragic mood in nature is best seen in his famous Jewish Cemetery at Dresden. A larger, more elaborate autograph version is at the Detroit Institute of Arts. These works are moralizing landscapes that were painted with a deliberate allegorical programme. The combination of their conspicuous tombs, ruins, large dead beech trees, broken trunks, and rushing streams alludes to the familiar themes of transience and the vanity of life and the ultimate futility of human endeavour, while the burst of light that breaks through the ravening clouds in each painting, their rainbows and the luxuriant growth that contrasts with the dead trees offer a promise of hope and renewed life.The masterliness of the Dresden painting lies in the artist's clear and concentrated presentation of these ideas. The eye focuses on the three tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized. They present a truthful picture of the actual, identifiable sarcophagi as they can still be seen in the Portuguese-Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk on the Amstel River near Amsterdam. Ruisdael made carefully worked-up drawings of the tombs, one of which he used as a preparatory drawing for the paintings. But the landscape settings of the Dresden and Detroit paintings bear no resemblance whatsoever to the site at Ouderkerk. They are Ruisdael's inventions. The cemetery never had monumental ruins. Those seen in the Dresden version were transplants from the shattered remains of Egmond Castle near Alkmaar, a site about forty kilometres from Ouderkerk; they also are based on a preparatory drawing. The ruins seen in the Detroit painting are probably derived from the ruins of Egmond's old Abbey Church. A rushing stream does not bisect the actual burial ground. (Would anyone in his right mind place tombs near a vigorous stream which would wreak havoc with the tombstones and coffins beneath them when it flooded?) The stream was included as a traditional allusion to the passage of time. Most remarkable is the barren beech tree in the Dresden picture that gestures toward the three tombs and heavenwards. If ever a tree was capable of seducing a viewer to accept the pathetic fallacy of endowing natural forms with human feelings and emotions it is this dead beech.The iconographical programme of Ruisdael's two versions of the Jewish Cemetery leaves no doubt that they were intended as moralizing landscapes. He made no others that can be given a similar unmistakable reading. None of his other existing paintings include tombs; those done by his contemporaries are rare, and some of them are based on his depictions of the sarcophagi at Ouderkerk. However, Ruisdael made numerous pictures that include identifiable or imaginary ruins, dead and broken trees, rushing streams, rivers, and waterfalls. Were these motifs invariably intended by the artist as symbols of transience and the vanity of life, and does the handful of them that include rainbows allude to hope? It has been argued that this is indeed the case, and that these motifs not only offer the iconographical essence of Ruisdael's landscapes but offer the key to the meaning to seventeenth-century landscape painting. According to this interpretation they were intended as visual sermons to convey the biblical message that man lives in a transient world beset by sinful temptation, but may hope for salvation

42652-36stand.jpg	Signature: Signed on the instrument.Provenance: The early documents do not differentiate between a lady standing or seated at the clavecin. It is therefore not certain whether it is this or the Lady Seated at a Virginal (National Gallery, London) that was part of the collection of Diego Duarte in Antwerp in 1682. The same is true of no. 37 in the Amsterdam sale of 1696; and also of the work recorded in the Amsterdam sale of 1714. It is only since the Amsterdam sale of 1797 that the lady is identified as standing, and therefore refers to this painting. Collection E. Solly, London; sale Edward Lake, London, Christie, 1845; collection Thor�-B�rger, 1866; sale Thor�-B�rger, Paris, 1892; art gallery Lawrie, London. There acquired by the museum in the same month (December).This painting now hangs at the National Gallery, London, together with A Lady Seated at the Virginal. There is no certitude that the two are companion pieces, but they obviously are closely related as to subject matter. The technique exemplifies in both instances Vermeer's late period.As we might suspect in an artist with his aspirations, Vermeer injected narrative or allegorical significance even into his domestic interiors. The young woman strokes the keys of the virginal - a smaller version of the harpsichord - but looks expectantly out of the picture. Music, we recall, is the 'food of love', and the empty chair calls to mind an absent sitter, perhaps travelling abroad among the mountains depicted in the picture on the wall and on the lid of the virginal. Cupid holding up a playing card or tablet has been related to an emblem of fidelity to one lover, as illustrated in one of the popular contemporary Dutch emblem books, where the image is explained in the accompanying motto and text. It has been suggested, not altogether convincingly, that the painting forms a contrasting pair with its neighbour, Vermeer's Young Woman seated at a Virginal, where the viola da gamba in the foreground awaits the partner of a duet but the picture of the Procuress (by the Utrecht artist Baburen) behind the woman points to mercenary love.Whether or not the paintings are thus related, both surely portray young women dreaming of love. But the theme seems commonplace beside Vermeer's treatment of it. Cool daylight streams in through the window on the left, as it always does in his pictures. The textures of grey-veined marble and white-and-blue Delft tiles, of gilt frame and whitewashed wall, of blue velvet and taffeta and white satin, of scarlet bows, are differentiated through the action of this light in their most minute particularities and specific lustre. Volume is revealed, shadows cast and space created. Yet the real magic of the painting is that all this does not, as it were, exhaust the light. Enough of it remains as a palpable presence diffused throughout the room to reach out to us beyond the picture's frame.

32980-02inghir.jpg	This portrait shows the eminent man of letters and librarian of Pope Leo X with an absorbed expression, in the act of writing. It is assumed that Inghirami worked with Raphael on the program of the Stanza della Segnatura. The portrait is an exceptional work for its fullness of vision and vibrant colours, without being excessively grandiose or dramatic.There are two extant versions: one in Boston and the other in Palazzo Pitti. Each has been considered the original at one time or another, but the dispute is useless, since both are highly coherent and the differences between them are slight: the physical structure of Inghirami is more massive in the Boston portrait and leaner in the Pitti one. It is accepted by some experts that both versions are the work of Raphael, the Boston version being the earlier from 1512-14.The red of the clothing dominates both. Inghirami's crossed eyes, a physical defect which the artist does not leave out, acquire a discreet tone which almost dissolves in the inspired pose of the figure. Without idealizing, but also without falling into unpleasant naturalism, Raphael maintains a harmonic equilibrium between realism and dignified celebration, a primary characteristic of portrait painting

42393-calmsea2.jpg	Willem van de Velde the Younger is renowned as the greatest marine painter of the Dutch Golden Age. His remarkable skill with the brush, his understanding of light and his profound knowledge of and interest in weather conditions, which he would very often experience first-hand out on the water with pen and paper, breathed life into all of his subjects.This painting is a youthful work by Willem van de Velde the Younger. The focus of the scene is on two battleships that are flying the Dutch flag, one shown from the side, the other from the stern. The stern shows the image of a brightly-coloured bird rising from the flames. In those days, the carved, painted, and gilded ornaments on ships' stern were references to the name of the vessel, so this frigate must have been the Phoenix, an English warship captured by the Dutch in 1652

20249-lawyer.jpg	The painting represents a three quarter length portrait of a lawyer sitting at a giltwood console table in an interior, with law-books and papers before him.Thomas Hudson was by far the leading portrait painter in London for two decades in the middle years of the 18th century. He had arrived in London in the 1720s after the death of Sir Godfrey Kneller, who had dominated London society portraiture for decades. His portrait practice by 1740 was substantial and highly successful, and numerous paintings by him survive. He continued the tradition of Van Dyck and Lely, and maintained a large studio with numerous talented young artists whom he taught: Henry Pickering, Joseph Wright of Derby, Sir Joshua Reynolds and others. He usually employed Joseph Van Aken as his drapery painter, and the consequence is that many of the works of these artists in these two decades are often difficult to distinguish one from another

12375-hagar.jpg	Dujardin was a Dutch Italianate painter. Additionally, he painted handsome portraits of famous citizens in the style of Bartholomeus van der Helst, and he also painted elegant, highly finished religious and allegorical paintings, like the picture shown here.Hagar, the Egyptian hand maiden of Sarah was the mother of Ishmael, Abraham's first son. When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ishmael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water near by, so they were both saved. Two scenes, the banishment, and the appearance of the angel are common in 17th century Italian and Dutch painting

37137-9commun.jpg	This work seems to be straining to escape from the cruel and tragic style of the Last Judgment of Orvieto and the Lamentation of Cortona, in order to imitate the sweet tones of the airy architecture of Raphael and the new sixteenth-century school.The iconography of this panel is very unusual. The apostles, some standing, some on their knees, surround Christ to receive the consecrated Host. This contrasts with the traditional way in which the apostles are represented, seated around a set table. A classical structure functions as a background. The work reminds one of the rhythmic works of Perugino and seems to imitate Raphael's School of Athens. The figure of Judas is stupendous; he is leaning to one side hiding the Host in his bag with a look that shows the painful realization of his betrayal.The painting is signed and dated on the first capitals of the background columns

14773-marriage.jpg	The subject of the painting is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. It was Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete, who helped Theseus, whom she loved, to escape from the labyrinth with the aid of a ball of string, but all she had in return was to be abandoned by him on the island of Naxos. Here Bacchus came to her rescue. Bacchus took her jeweled crown and flung it into the heavens where it became a constellation.

03986-bello214.jpg	In 1760 the Kreuzkirche, the oldest church in Dresden, was shelled by Prussian artillery; a blaze ensued during which the building collapsed. The church tower, though damaged, remained standing. When the work of reconstructing the church commenced it was decided to preserve the original tower. In June 1765, however, when the construction of the new church was already under way, the greater part of the tower collapsed nevertheless.This painting is one of Bellotto's later works, painted during his second stay in Saxony. It demonstrates his quite extraordinary, perhaps unique, capacity to capture the spirit of an event. In this case it was the demolition of the Gothic church of the Holy Cross in Dresden's New Market Square. This image of ruin, bordering on an anatomical dissection of the mortally wounded church, was to reappear two centuries after Bellotto's day with the devastating bombing of Dresden during the Second World War

14940-6pould10.jpg	This work was produced in response to the painting by Courbet, the Bonjour Monsieur Courbet, that Gauguin and van Gogh had seen together in the Mus�e Fabre in Montpellier in December 1888. Gauguin's version, painted several months later, bears little overt resemblance to the original.In Courbet's version, the artist depicted himself in the guise of a wandering Jew who meets his patron Bruyas, accompanied by his manservant on the road to Montpellier. Bruyas doffs his hat to the artist, and the servant stands with head respectfully lowered. In depicting himself thus, Courbet has referred to the changing status of the artist in the nineteenth century and has represented himself in a romantic role, as an essentially misunderstood, creative genius, working outside the norms of bourgeois society. It was to this aspect that Gauguin responded in this version, and the flavour of the original has been retained, although the composition and figures are markedly different. From his earliest self-portraits Gauguin had cast himself in the role of the artistic martyr and in 1889 this was to reach a climax in works like the Green Christ and Christ in the Garden of Olives

40392-5dragon1.jpg	The majority of art historians attribute to Paolo Uccello the two small paintings of St George and the Dragon (National Gallery, London and Mus�e Jacquemart-Andr�, Paris). The London picture was probaly painted around 1456 and the Paris one shortly afterwards, not later than 1460. They confirm Paolo's talent in small-scale works and his ability as a lively and imaginative storyteller. In both works the foreshortening effects and the perspective models play a fundamental role; the graceful and elegant characters, the unreal lighting, the careful description of all details are still very much like late Gothic narrative styles

37584-portra_y.jpg	In the late 15th century, the spread of the use of oils resulted in technical improvements in the quality of materials and in the representation of the fall of light on objects and flesh. The austerity of this portrait of an unidentified young man, similar to the portraits by Antonello da Messina, is emphasized by the dark, almost black colour which surrounds the face, on which all the light falls. The surrounding black is only broken by the line of white of the collar and the lighter line which marks the opening of the sitter's outer garment. The long, carefully groomed hair conforms with late 15th-century fashion, which had moved away from the richness and luxuriousness of clothing of the earlier part of the century towards a much plainer style, possibly in line with the spiritual mood of the times

22359-samsonde.jpg	This painting, presenting the three half-length Old Testament figures in a crowded composition, was painted by Jan Lievens in the second half of the 1620s when he was working in Leiden with Rembrandt. Their relationship can be characterized as a kind  of artistic rivalry in which the two young artists were equal. They studied each other's work seeking inspiration for their own compositions. This can be seen in the choice of subject matter. Rembrandt also painted the story of Samson and Delilah at about the same time. However, this painting shows more differences than similarities in comparison with the work by Lievens.For Lievens's representation of the scene, a painting by Gerrit van Honthorst can be considered as source of inspiration.

34304-maruce04.jpg	The largest room on the ground floor is the Sala d'Ercole, a hall with two window bays. It has three entrances and presents an elaborate painted decoration extending across all four walls and the entire ceiling. The decoration was executed with the collaboration of Giuseppe Tonelli (1668-1732), one of the best known quadratura painters in Florence. The pictorial program contains the Labours and Apotheosis of Hercules.A simple, rhythmic arrangement of columns, backed by a gilt ground, structures all four walls in the room. On three sides it is interrupted by a large, arched centre opening. The compositions for these imaginary openings are three of Hercules's more significant labours. Prominent on the end wall is the depiction of the young Hercules at the Crossroad between Vice and Virtue, the other two openings contains Hercules and Cacus, and Hercules and Nessus. On the window wall a painted sculpture depicting Hercules and Antaeus can be found.In the Sala d'Ercole Ricci's fluid, elegant, and atmospheric style attains a brilliance and airiness that set him apart from all his famous contemporaries, and has been shown to anticipate features of Rococo painting

13727-rosso1.jpg	The Palazzo Brignole Sale (dubbed Palazzo Rosso because of the colour of its stucco exterior) was erected between 1671 and 1679 on the prestigious Strada Nuova (present-day Via Garibaldi) in Genoa. The decoration of the palazzo was accomplished in two phases. In 1687-89 the team of Domenico Piola and Gregorio de Ferrari - with the assistance of Niccol&#242; di Viviano Codazzi (1642-1693), Antonio Maria Haffner (1654-1732) and Sebastiano Monchi (c. 1630-1706) - painted the east wing, including the south loggia, then in 1691-92 the frescoes in the rooms of the west wing were executed by Giovanni Andrea Carlone with the assistance of Antonio Maria Haffner and Carlo Antonio Tavella (1668-1738). The quadratura painter Antonio Maria Haffner worked both for the Piola-Ferrari and Carlone teams.The works by Piola and Ferrari in the east wing, the four rooms on the third floor dedicated to the Four Seasons, are considered the highlights of the entire decoration. The ceiling paintings of the Seasons, striking in their vivid colours and their synthesis of influences from Correggio and Pietro da Cortona, are among the most successful achievements of Genoese painting from the High Baroque.The cycle of the seasons was a favoured subject in room decoration. The cycle illustrated in the Palazzo Rosso deviates from the traditional iconography, replacing the familiar pictorial motifs with deities and personifications. Spring is represented by Mars and Venus, presented as contrary forces suggestive of the months they dominate. The image and spirit of summer are embodied  by an extremely foreshortened Apollo-Helios, barely recognizable against the glowing sun, and a lion symbolizing summer's zenith. Autumn is personified by Bacchus with Ariadne and his train made up of satyrs, Maenads, and cupids. Personifications of the cold winds Eurus, Borea and Austro represent winter.The allegories for Autumn and Winter were executed by Domenico Piola.

00863-sacraco.jpg	This fresco on the wall of the east corridor of the convent is also called Madonna of the Shadows (Madonna delle Ombre).Painted in the corridor off which the brethren's cells open (between cells 25 and 26), this fresco was one of Fra Angelico's last works in San Marco's Dominican Monastery. There is almost a metaphysical feel to the frozen gestures, the deep gazes, and the strong and boldly-applied colours. This sensation is boosted by the power of the side-lighting, which in turn is emphasized by the long shadows cast by the classical capitals. These are reminiscent of architecture by Michelozzo. This fresco is the painter's ultimate achievement of wonderful synthesis between his mystical inspiration and the effective application of recent breakthroughs in Renaissance painting

31879-y_woman1.jpg	The painting shows a young woman wearing an exquisite brocade dress. Although at first glance a half-length portrait is suggested, the subject's posture indicates that she is sitting in the marble embrasure of a window or balcony. A bright blue sky fills almost the entire background and contrasts with the pale flesh-tint to give the picture its distinctive colour-harmony.The painter has shown an incredibly sure touch in bringing out the essential features of the young woman's face in profile. The features are delineated with the minimum of detail. The pattern of the brocade dress, depicted in the plane, underlines the medallion-like character of the picture. The emphatic use of line and the clarity of the contrasting colour-surfaces have always been regarded as typical of the Florentine style, but opinions differ as to the identity of the master.The attribution to Domenico Veneziano we owe to Wilhelm Bode; before he purchased the portrait it had been attributed to Piero della Francesca. Latterly, the view has gained ground that this portrait was the work of Antonio Pollaiuolo. However, it is alternatively attributed to Alessio Baldovinetti

26017-08sorrow.jpg	This iconographical type, in which the Man of Sorrows (Christ displaying his wounds to the faithful) is supported by the Virgin, is not a common one. It is, in fact, a conflation of the Marian Piet&#224;, in which the Virgin cradles her dead son in her lap, and the Trinity Piet&#224;, in which God the Father holds the recently crucified Christ before him. It is an emblematic representation intended as the object of meditation rather than the portrayal of an episode from the Gospels. Similarly, the Arma Christi in the background should be interpreted as signs of the Passion. Several emblems are included, in addition to obvious attributes such as the Cross, on which hangs the dark-purple robe from Christ's Mockery; the post from the flagellation with its rope, rods and flails; the cane and sponge, the spear, the hammer and nails. Looking from top to bottom, we see: on the left, Peter with Caiaphas' servant-girl, Judas with the purse around his neck, Annas and Caiaphas, the hand which struck Jesus, the fist that punched him, and another hand with closed fingers; on the right, Pilate and Herod, a hand making the obscene fica gesture, a head in profile (customarily one of the soldiers who mocked or spat at Christ), a hand that has pulled out some of Jesus' hair, and a stamping foot.Apart from a few copies, there is one larger version that is worthy of particular note (Granada, Capilla Real). This might be a copy of a second version of the same theme, also designed by Memling. A third Memling Man of Sorrows is also known, in which the figure of Christ makes the same gesture with his right arm as the Granada type.It is assumed that the painting belonged to a triptych. It has been established with near certainty that the Angel with a sword in London's Wallace Collection is the right wing of this triptych, and that the recently discovered Angel with an olive branch in the Louvre is a fragment of the left wing.The date on the column capital is no longer clearly legible. The last numeral is particularly badly abraded, which gave rise to a variety of readings in the past

38924-05berga1.jpg	The impressive figure of John the Baptist, delivering his sermon with raised forefinger from the top of a rock in the landscape, dominates the right-hand side of the picture. His cross staff and the lamb at his feet refer to the fate of Christ. The left-hand side of the picture is almost completely taken up by men, women and children, who listen spellbound to the sermon. The young woman placed in the very centre of the picture breast-feeding her child, who thus conforms to the standardized portrayal of the Madonna and Child, can be understood as an allusion to the birth of Christ, which is the subject of John's sermon

26217-1altar.jpg	The main body of the altarpiece consists of five panels: a central panel of the Virgin and Child, flanked by two panels on either side, each of which is divided into two narrative scenes, one on top of the other. The four scenes to the left of the central image depict episodes from the story of Sts Joachim and Anna and the Birth of the Virgin.  Those on the right relate two miracles of the Virgin associated with the celebration of the Feast of the Conception. A predella depicting Christ and the Apostles runs beneath the main scenes. The altarpiece can be attributed to a Venetian-born artist working in Zadar. In the past it was attributed simply to the Venetian school. The names of Lorenzo Veneziano and Jacobello del Bonomo were mentioned in this connection. However, the work is now attributed to Meneghello di Giovanni de' Canali

32758-02solly.jpg	Before his arrival in Florence, Raphael had already had occasion to compose small-scale devotional icons of the Madonna and Child, linked to a taste for the versions created by Perugino. An interesting sequence of this type can be seen in several examples, all from around 1502 to 1504, built on the motif of the Madonna holding a book. They are known as the Solly Madonna (in Berlin), the Norton Simon Madonna (in California) and the Conestabile Madonna (in St. Petersburg).Mary reads as the baby turns his head toward her book.

18862-prodigal.jpg	This work is from Guercino's early period, when he was beginning to achieve some initial fame and was already familiar with both the main trends of early Italian Baroque, Caravaggism and the Bolognese reform of the Annibale Carracci school. His decision to use the approach of Caravaggio may have something to do with the choice of subject matter, contrasting the humility of human existence and the possibilities of costume as disguise - a concept formulated by Caravaggio in his paintings for San Luigi and frequently taken up by his followers.Guercino does not portray the return of the prodigal son as a scene of recognition or joy, choosing instead to depict a more tranquil motif from the biblical parable - the moment when he is given fine robes to wear. On the left in the painting, the young man has stood up and is removing the rags of the swineherd, while an old man, presumably his father, places a hand on his shoulder and takes a clean shirt from the other, foppishly dressed young man who is holding new clothes over his outstretched arm and new shoes in his hand. By using light and shade to divide the group, Guercino lends a singular autonomy to the dynamics of the outstretched and grasping hands, thereby intensifying the narrative in a most unusual way.This painting was commissioned by Cardinal Giacomo Serra, the papal legate to Ferrara.

06626-goldenta.jpg	"Jan Brueghel the Elder, the youngest son of the world-famous painter Pieter Bruegel the Elder and court painter to the Archdukes Albrecht and Isabella, truly merited his nickname of ""Velvet Brueghel"". The precision and virtuosity of his still-lifes are superbly illustrated by the present work with its striking and radiant enamel-like colours. This extremely elegant little panel, whichexists in several versions, can probably be counted as one of the jewels of 17th century painting. Against a chased silver-gilt tazza or drinking bowl leans a wreath of spring and summer flowers, made up of carnations, roses, anemones, periwinkles, turban buttercups, lilies of the valley, forget-me-nots and hawthorns, as well as tulips and African marigolds, newly introduced into the Netherlands.From his correspondence we know that Jan Brueghel worked mostly from nature and that such compositions cost him a great deal of effort, because of his concern to execute them with such precision and devotion. On the table lies a jewel box containing a gold ring, coins, a pearl necklace and two identical golden bracelets set with agates. In those days women mostly wore the same bracelets on both wrists. Alongside the box we can make out another three rings set with diamonds, and a pendant with enamel insets, precious stones and tear-shaped pearls. The golden pearl hairpin to the left of the tazza is an ornament that appears only in the Netherlands in the first half of the 17th century. In most cases this pin is placed in the hair next to the head covering. On the marriage day it changes side from left to right, or right to left, depending on the region. The presence of the hairpin and the pearl necklace, pointing to the immaculate marital morality of the wearer, suggests that the panel can perhaps be interpreted as an allegory of marriage.An innovative feature in this still-life is the use of diagonals. Not only the wreath, but also the jewels and the jewel case lie obliquely on the table, in order to produce a stronger effect of depth. Here wealth symbolises beauty. Both the flowers and the jewels stand out brightly against the neutral background. Brueghel paints with equal affection the humble white carnation and the baroque pendant next to it."

07206-canal409.jpg	Twenty kilometres to the west of Venice lies Dolo, a village on the river Brenta, which flows from Padua into the Lagoon at Mestre. The friendly Brenta, with its many country houses, was a favourite destination for excursions by boat. Canaletto immortalized the Brenta in numerous drawings, etchings and paintings.This is one of the earliest and most beautiful of these paintings. The subject is the mills built in the Brenta River near Dolo. Canaletto represented the view towards the east from a tall house located on the dam in the river. The sun shines from the west, as indicated by the shadow of the house where the artist sat, which falls to the right in the foreground. On the left the quay, lined with the most prominent houses, the inn and the campanile of San Rocco, makes a wide curve. On the other side of the Brenta are some free-standing buildings and a covered wharf. In front of these on the right, outside the image, begins the canal through which the traffic is led round the mill by way of the sluices. Arriving in the background is a 'burchiello' with a striped cover glides along the bend at the right, and a third boat with a red roof disappears just around the corner. Boats and small barges are moored to the banks on either side of the river.In the foreground we see the mill complex with a couple of unused millstones on the left and the basin which powers the paddles; the gates have been lowered. It is late afternoon and the villagers seem to have finished their work for the day. They take their ease on a sack of flour, do a bit of fishing or chat with neighbours. A lady dressed in red is greeted by a couple whose servant protects them from the sun with a parasol. This group in particular attracts our attention. They are apparently prosperous towns-people out for a leisurely visit in the country.The serenity of the scene is achieved by means of the composition; in a very restful and astonishingly well-ordered fashion all the anecdotal and topographical elements have been grouped round the Brenta, which occupies only a small portion of the entire painting. Most of the composition is reserved for the blue and white of the sky, which harmonize wonderfully well with the browns and greens of the foreground, enlivened by the contrasting touches of red, white and blue of the elegant burghers

20733-fertilit.jpg	"This is without doubt one of Jacob Jordaens' most magnificent compositions and one of the most successful examples of his cooperation with still-life specialist Frans Snyders. In this work, painted around 1623, a good eight years after Jordaens had become a free master, the painter is at the peak of his career. Nothing remains of the clumsiness of his youthful work. Whether the eye stays on the anatomy or the expressions of the figures, on their rhythmic ordering or their gestures, or enjoys the creamy, confident paint strokes or the alternation between the golden light and the transparent shadows, or is tempted by the rich colours of Snyders' opulent fruits: everywhere it senses the same impressive harmony.The life-size figures, allowing only a glimpse of the landscape to show through, unfold like a sculpted frieze on both sides of a female nude, seen from behind, standing slightly off centre and so introducing a certain dynamism into the composition. Her nakedness catches the full light and draws the viewer's attention. A golden glow strokes her skin, in which nothing reminds us of the cold stone from which her sculptural monumentality initially seems to originate. Rather, as a nymph she belongs, together with her female companions and the satyrs surrounding her, to the category of beings between humans, gods and animals which in antiquity embodied the untameable powers of nature. The grapes that they are all gathering possibly symbolise the rich fertility of nature. For this reason the identification of the nymph seen from behind as ""Humanity"" is not convincing. Just as unsatisfactory is the identification of the woman in a red mantle to her right as Pomona, the goddess of fruit.The cornucopia on the far right is a reference to Ovid's Metamorphoses, which tells how it came into being when the horn of Achelous, metamorphosed into a bull, broke off in his fight with Hercules. It was not Pomona but the water nymphs or naiads that afterwards filled it with fruit. In Jordaens' picture we do not, however, find the unambiguous references to Hercules and his unfortunate opponent, making it difficult to correctly title this masterpiece"

40387-3crucifi.jpg	Stylistically very close to the Prato frescoes is a group of paintings whose attribution to Uccello is controversial. Among them we can find the Crucifixion in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection in Madrid.The this little Crucifixion the characters are very close to the Prato frescoes. The Madonna, next to the cross, has the same graceful movements, rather like a ballerina, as the handmaid to the left in the fresco of the Birth of the Virgin.The unusual, elongated composition, depicting the crucified Christ with the Virgin and Sts John the Baptist, John the Evangelist and Francis, suggests that it may have formed part of a predella.

25987-02last0.jpg	His almost obsessional concern for realistic detail did not prevent Memling from using allegory and symbol in his work. In one of his early works, the Last Judgment Triptych, the damned and the elect are linked together to form a garland of bodies, some tortured, some beatific, in descending and rising forms that span the entire composition. Christ is seated on a circular rainbow which separates the world above from the world below, his feet resting on a golden globe. To either side of his head are the lily of mercy and the blazing sword of justice.

07120-ascensio.jpg	The main scenes painted on the nave vault of San Sigismondo, near Cremona, are The Descent of the Holy Spirit (1557-59) by Giulio Campi, The Ascension of Christ (1549) by Bernardino Gatti, and The Resurrection of Christ and Jonah and the Whale (1540) by Domenico de Siccis.The traditional vault decoration of the fifteenth century was still a painted blue firmament, it might have evangelists, church fathers, prophets, sibyls, or saints, enthroned or merely floating. In the Sistine Chapel in 1508-12, Michelangelo painted illusionistic architecture filled with figures to serve as the frame for a cycle of biblical stories. This innovation did not find many followers at first. However, around the middle of the sixteenth century, barrel and cloister vaults were increasingly decorated with works that responded to Michelangelo's system for the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Painted ornamental articulations run across the entire vault and began to mark off fields for pictorial narratives and accompanying figures. One of the most astonishing solutions can be found in the monastery church of San Sigismondo, near Cremona. Transverse arches divide the main vault into three sections, each of which opens up to form a large pictorial filed on the ceiling panel. They were frescoed in sequence, starting from the crossing and moving toward the entrance wall

14133-01psyche.jpg	A prize-winning pupil of Fran�ois Boucher, Fragonard in this youthful picture, painted at the �cole des �l�ves Prot�g�s in Paris, seems a perfect exponent of the taste of Boucher's patrons King Louis XV and his mistress the Marquise de Pompadour. However, after an unsuccessful final bid for institutional recognition at the Paris Salon exhibition of 1767, Fragonard virtually disappeared from official artistic life under the monarchy, working almost entirely for private patrons, many of them his friends. He was thus able to give free rein to a more individualistic celebration of nature, instinct and impulse. Whether in oils, gouache, pastels, in engravings and etchings, or in his many drawings in chalk, pen or wash, he came to efface the distinctions between sketch and finished work, and even between the boundaries of the genres. We cannot always tell, for example, whether any one of his many pictures of single figures is a portrait in fancy dress, or imaginary.On his two visits to Italy, the first to the French Academy in Rome (1756-61), and the second over a decade later as the guest of a patron, Fragonard was drawn to the landscape and to contemporary and near-contemporary Italian artists, notably Tiepolo and Giordano. He was unmoved either by ancient ruins or by Renaissance art. With the collapse of the art market during the French Revolution he retired to his native Grasse in Southern France, but was drawn into politics by his son's teacher, the painter David. His late paintings show him trying to conform, not always successfully, to the Neo-classical austerity of David's 'republican' style.The subject here is drawn from the allegorical tale of Cupid and Psyche by the Latin poet Apuleius, probably in a French version by La Fontaine. Psyche is showing off her 'storehouses of treasure' to her sisters in the magical castle in which she has been installed by Cupid, god of love. The sisters 'conceived great envy' - personified here by the serpent-haired figure of Eris, goddess of discord, hovering above - and try to wreck her happiness by destroying her faith in her invisible lover. In its handling of paint, and in such details as the chubby flying babies - the putti of ancient art, who here represent the castle's invisible servants - the picture, painted when the artist was barely 21, betrays the influence of Rubens's works at the Luxembourg Palace and also of Watteau.The composition is derived from a tapestry design for the same subject by Boucher. But the colours, with harmonies of gold and orange beginning to replace Boucher's accords of rose and blue, are already recognisably Fragonard's own. They appear in their purest and most concentrated form in the flowers at the foot of Psyche's throne, the area of the painting most clearly 'in focus'. Definition diminishes towards the edges of the picture, as it might in a convex mirror, and with it the colours tend to lose their identity, to mix and mingle, framing the main figures in shades of grey or darkened tones, presaging the disasters to come.

38781-thoma3.jpg	Thoma painted this panoramic view in 1873, during the time he was living in Frankfurt. This canvas marks a new period in his work, one in which he moved away from the allegorical and mythological themes that had previously taken up so much of his life. Thoma also moved to a much broader, freer form of expression than that dictated during his art school days in D�sseldorf. This new manner was inspired by a journey, in 1866, to Paris, where he also explored the achievements of the Barbizon school. This river view was one of the artist's favourites, and Thoma painted it at least seven times

09554-corot09.jpg	Corot's 'studies' painted outdoors directly from the motif were private works and were not exhibited by him at the Paris Salons. They were none the less formative on generations of artists, having been bought up after Corot's death by fellow-painters, including Degas. A late developer, inspired by Constable's landscapes exhibited at the Salon of 1824, fortunate to be supported and encouraged by his parents, Corot became one of the most unassuming revolutionaries in the history of art. He is the agent of change from the severely stylised French 'ideal landscape' tradition derived from Poussin and Claude to modern landscape painting, finding classical peace and harmony in the face of nature itself.This canvas was painted in the Morvan, a district west of Dijon in Burgundy, which Corot visited frequently on painting expeditions in the early 1840s. His father's family had originated there, and he must have felt a particular affinity with the region. A peasant saws timber; his wife helps him. Trees and distant village buildings are silhouetted against the sky, irradiated with the fresh cool light of early morning, and long shadows fall on the grass, where we can just make out a glint of white plumage on the back of a goose with dun-feathered wings waddling out to graze

44718-scenes.jpg	This scene is part of the decoration of the Sala Terrena in the Casa Zuccari, Florence.It is characteristic of Zuccari's self-confidence that the artistic and intellectual effort he invested in designing his own home was comparable to that which he expended on the residences of those who commissioned his work. Like Vasari, he owned two homes, and he emulated Vasari's model first in Florence and then in Rome. In his case, art historical ideas first came into play in the Roman house; in Florence just one scene relates to everyday life in the artist's household, and the other frescoes depict fables and allegories.Pure genre scenes like the view of the Zuccari family's daily life in the artist's Florentine house are extremely rare in the monumental form of fresco decorations in the sixteenth century. Comparable scenes are, however, regularly found as elements of landscapes or grotesques

19795-marriag1.jpg	This is Scene 1 of the series of six, entitled The Marriage Settlement.Controversial and quarrelsome, Hogarth is one of the most attractive and innovative British artists. Born in London, he trained as an engraver, later studying painting at a private academy, but was frustrated in his ambition to become an English 'history painter'. He blamed this on the vogue for Old Masters and competition from Continental contemporaries. His vociferous patriotism, however, cannot disguise his own indebtedness to French art; nor did he hesitate to advertise his use of 'the best Masters in Paris' to engrave the series Marriage &#224; la Mode, of which this picture is the first.Since he could not earn a living as a portraitist or monumental painter, Hogarth conceived the notion of 'modern moral subjects' to be sold as engravings on subscription, as well as in their original painted state. In the spirit of the 'comic epics' of Henry Fielding, whom influenced and was later to influence him, these 'comic history paintings' are the works by which we best remember the artist and which most clearly express his own moral certitudes. They are related to sixteenth-century broadsheets, and to the 'conversation pieces' theatrical subjects which Hogarth himself helped to popularise.Marriage &#224; la Mode, 'representing a Variety of Modern Occurrences in High-Life', was advertised for subscription in April 1743. The theme, an unhappy marriage between the daughter of a rich, miserly alderman merchant and the son of an impoverished earl, was suggested by current events but also indebted to Dryden's comedy of the same name, and by a recent play of Garricks. As the pictures were designed to be engraved - each print a mirror image of the composition incised on a copper plate - the sequence of events in every painting is reversed.The series thus begins with the proud Earl pointing to his family tree rooted in William the Conqueror; he rests his gouty foot - a sign of degeneracy - on a footstool decorated with his coronet. Behind him is a lavish building in the  new classical style, unfinished for lack of money; a creditor is thrusting bills at him. But on the table in front of him is a pile of gold - the bride's dowry just handed him by the bespectacled alderman, who holds the marriage contract. Silvertongue, an ingratiating lawyer, whispers in the ear of the alderman's daughter listlessly twirling her wedding ring on a handkerchief. Turning away from her to take snuff and admire himself in the glass - and, in the engraving, to lead our eye into the next tableau - is the foppish bridegroom. At his feet, symbolic of the couple's plight, are a dog and a bitch chained to each other. From the walls horrid Italian Old Master martyrdoms presage tragedy, and a Gorgon's head screams from an oval frame above the pair.The rest of the series follows the pathetic adventures of the ill-assorted pair: he frequents a child prostitute and contracts venereal disease; she incurs debts in fashionable pursuits and takes Silvertongue as her lover. Discovered in a house of assignation, the lawyer kills the husband, is arrested and executed. The Countess, back in the alderman' mean house (where the 'low-life' paintings on the walls are Dutch, and the dog is starving) swallows poison; her father strips her wedding ring from her hand and a servant takes her weeping child, whose crippled leg in a brace recalls his tainted inheritance

03335-mystic_m.jpg	In his most productive period for public works Fra Bartolomeo's designs are distinguished by a basic clarity and emotional reticence. The most characteristic and fully realized of this series of altarpieces is the Mystic marriage of St Catherine, also known as the Pala Pitti, signed and dated 1512. Commissioned to replace Fra Bartolomeo's altarpiece sent to France in 1512 (now in the Louvre) it was painted for a side altar dedicated to St Catherine in the left nave of St Marco where a copy remains.The central narrative is expanded by the addition of some thirteen laterally displaced saints in the sort of crowded design for which Fra Bartolomeo is well known.

07841-02prese.jpg	In preparing the altar-piece to decorate the third altar on the right in the Church of San Giobbe, Venice, Vittore Carpaccio certainly kept in mind the magnificent panel painted by Giovanni Bellini for the same church little more than twenty years before. Compared with Bellini's picture, the marble sections of Carpaccio's niche are even more monumental and the figures more nicely balanced in their perfectly judged movements, including those of the angels intent on playing their instruments, the crumhorn, the lute and the lyre. And each passage of the perfect formal structure is lent firm definition by the light which slants in from the right and strikes cold gleams from the incorruptible pictorial subject. Once again, Carpaccio offers an expression of his humanistic vision through which he measures the visible world on a limpid, reflecting grid of space, colour, light and shade

36027-2boyflas.jpg	Illuminated from the upper left, a smiling boy is seen in three-quarter profile. He turns to his left where something or someone has caught his eye. He holds a flask above his shoulder and is surrounded by large cabbages, which occupy about a third of the painting. Based on a comparison with Still-life with Fruit, Vegetables and Animals, which is inscribed 'T.SALINI ANO F.1621', this enigmatic painting has also been attributed to Tommaso Salini, called Mao. The stylistic comparison centred around the cabbages which appear in both paintings. It was further suggested that the figure might have been executed by another artist, possibly Michelangelo Cerquozzi. In fact, the boy in the Madrid picture has little in common with the figures in Mao's two altarpieces in the Roman churches of Sant'Agnese and Sant'Agostino. Although Cerquozzi painted figures in his own still-lifes, any collaboration by him in this painting can be ruled out.Ironically, even though the most dubious element in the composition is the figure, it has been used to attribute a large group of paintings to Mao. These attributions seem even more inexplicable in the light of Tommaso Salini's will of 1625 and the inventory of his paintings. Besides religious and mythological subjects, and a few portraits (about 60 in all), there were 115 paintings of flowers and fruit either finished or left `imperfect'. Within this list of works, most of them bearing no author's name but nearly all of them by Mao, no compositions comparable to the Madrid picture exist. Unusually for Mao, the light and composition seem Caravaggesque. There is nothing about the painting which can be traced in early documents or related to the few securely attributed works by Mao, who, it should be noted, was a bitter enemy of Caravaggio

18209-0302grec.jpg	Giulio Clovio (1498-1578), a 'Greek' from Croatia, friend of El Greco's, worked as a miniaturist in the Farnese Library. He is portrayed holding an open book, his most famous work, an illuminated manuscript the Libro della Vergine, known as the Farnese Hours (at the time in the Farnese Library, and now in the The Morgan Library and Museum, New York). The book is shown open at folios 59v, showing God the Father creating the Sun and Moon, and 60r, showing the Holy Family.The portrait was painted probably soon after El Greco arrived in Rome (November 1570), and almost certainly for his friend. In the seventeenth century, it was in the possession of Fulvio Orsini, librarian to Cardinal Farnese. This is perhaps the earliest independent portrait by the artist who was to become one of the greatest portrait painters of all time. Three splendid portraits belong to his Italian years: the present portrait, possibly the earliest, and the signed portrait of a man in Copenhagen, both Titianesque; and the more personal Vincentio Anastagi, a signed portrait in the Frick Collection, New York. It is unfortunate that the self-portrait mentioned by Giulio Clovio is lost

14966-tahiti12.jpg	The most important paintings executed during Gauguin's first stay in Tahiti are the Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary) and The Spectre Watches over Her (Manao Tupapau).The inspiration for Manao Tupapau was two-fold: a free adaptation of Manet's Olympia which Gauguin had copied in 1891, and his reading of Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout's Voyages aux Iles de Grand Ocean in 1892. This work chronicled Polynesian customs and ritual, which by the time of Gauguin's arrival in Tahiti had largely vanished, mainly due to Western colonial interference. This work, first published in 1837, was the inspiration for Gauguin's Noa Noa which he began writing on his return to Paris in 1893.The model for the present painting was Tehura, Gauguin's companion at Tahiti

15867-perseus.jpg	Neapolitan painter, the most important Italian decorative artist of the second half of the 17th century. He was nicknamed `Luca Fa Presto' (Luke work quickly) because of his prodigious speed of execution and huge output. He began in the circle of Ribera, but his style became much more colorful under the influence of such great decorative painters as Veronese, whose works he saw on his extensive travels. Indeed, he absorbed a host of influences and was said to be able to imitate other artists' styles with ease. His work was varied also in subject-matter, although he was primarily a religious and mythological painter.He worked mainly in Naples, but also extensively in Florence and Venice, and his work had great influence in Italy. After five years back in Naples, Giordano went to Florence again where he produced one of his most important works, the gallery frescos in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi (1682). These airy, luminous frescos provide a foretaste of eighteenth century art.In 1692 he was called to Spain by Charles II and stayed there for 10 years, painting in Madrid, Toledo, and the Escorial. His last work when he returned to Naples was the ceiling of the Treasury Chapel of S.&#160;Martino. In his personal self-confidence and courtliness, and in the open, airy compositions and light luminous colors of his work, Giordano presages such great 18th-century painters as Tiepolo

06273-venus_cv.jpg	This work was probably created at the Tuscan court of Duke Cosimo de' Medici for presentation to the King of France. It was designed as a puzzle, and incorporates symbols and devices from the worlds of mythology and emblematic imagery. It would have made the perfect present for the French king, known for his lusty appetites, yearning after Italian culture and magnificence, and with a liking for heraldry and obscure emblems.The goddess of love and beauty, identified by the golden apple given to her by Paris and by her doves, has drawn Cupid's arrow. At her feet, masks, perhaps the symbols of sensual nymph and satyr, seem to gaze up at the lovers. Foolish Pleasure, the laughing child, throws rose petals at them, heedless of the thorn piercing his right foot. Behind him Deceit, fair of face, but foul of body, proffers a sweet honeycomb in one hand, concealing the sting in her tail with the other. On the other side of the lovers is a dark figure, formerly called Jealousy but recently plausibly identified as the personification of Syphilis, a disease probably introduced to Europe from the New World and reaching epidemic proportions by 1500.The symbolic meaning of the central scene is thus revealed to be unchaste love, presided over by Pleasure and abetted by Deceit, and its painful consequences. Oblivion, the figure on the upper left who is shown without physical capacity for remembering, attempts to draw a veil over all, but is prevented by Father Time - possibly alluding to the delayed effects of syphilis. Cold as marble or enamel, the nudes are deployed against the costliest ultramarine blue, and the whole composition, flattened against the picture plane, recalls Bronzino's contemporaneous designs for the duke's new tapestry factories.

42601-21wjug.jpg	Signature: Not signed.Provenance: This is one of Vermeer's paintings that came to light only relatively recently. Blankert attempts to identify it with an entry in the Robert Vernon collection from 1838, where the ascription was to Metsu. This work was subsequently sold in the Vernon sale from 1877, again as a Metsu. It is by no means certain that this painting was identical with the one that was sold by the London dealer Colnaghi to Lord Powerscrout for 600 guineas and was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, 1878, with for the first time the attribution to Jan van der Meer of Delft. It then passed into the hands of another London art dealer, Thomas Agnew, and finally the Paris art dealer Ch. Pillet, who sold it to Henry G. Marquand in 1887 for 800 U.S. dollars as a work by Pieter de Hooch. Marquand gave it to the museum in 1888. It was thus the first painting by Vermeer to enter an American public collection.The perfect balance of the composition, the cool clarity of the light, and the silvery tones of blue and gray combine to make this closely studied view of an interior a classic work by Vermeer. It is characteristic of his early maturity and dates from the beginning of the 1660s.The composition is simple: a young woman standing in the corner of a room, turned to the left, opening a window with her right hand and holding in her left hand a brass water jug. The jug is placed on a bowl of the same material, standing with some other paraphernalia on a table covered with a red Oriental rug. The whole appears as a symphony in yellow and blue; standing out against the white headdress and large collar worn by the young woman. The background is light, in imitation of Carel Fabritius. A map animates the right corner of the wall. The very simplicity and Oriental stillness of the model make this work one of the most significant compositions by the master. There is light, grace, and distinction here, a tendency toward abstraction that characterizes the master's maturity, and a delicacy in the execution that accompanies his evolution from:the early works toward a more artful manner of pictorial expression

18305-1104grec.jpg	There are two surviving landscapes by El Greco: The View of Toledo (Metropolitan Museum, New York) and the View and Plan of Toledo (Museo de El Greco, Toledo). They respond to very different objectives: one setting out to document the city in cartographic terms, the other evoking it through a selective arrangement of its most characteristic features. The Metropolitan painting belongs to a tradition of emblematic city views, its approach is interpretative rather than documentary: it seeks to portray the essence of the city rather than to record its actual appearance.Both in here and in the View and Plan the city is shown from the north, except that El Greco has included only the easternmost portion, above the Tagus river. This partial view would have excluded the cathedral, which he therefore imaginatively moved to the left of the dominant Alc�zar or royal palace. The fact that an identical view appears in the Saint Joseph and the Christ Child in the Capilla de San Jos� suggests that the painting was conceived in connection with the San Jos� commission (1597-99). From that time, the town features in many of his paintings: in the Laoco�n (National Gallery of Art, Washington), the Christ in Agony on the Cross (Cincinnati Art Museum), the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception (Museo de Santa Cruz), in all of which it takes on an apocalyptical character appropriate to the themes. In his late Saint John the Baptist (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco) the landscape of the Escorial is appropriately introduced.This is one of the earliest independent landscapes in Western art and one of the most dramatic and individual landscapes ever painted. It is not just a 'View of Toledo', although the topographical details are correct; neither is it 'Toledo at night' or 'Toledo in a storm', other titles which have been attached to the painting: it is simply 'Toledo', but Toledo given a universal meaning - a spiritual portrait of the town. In introducing the view into his paintings he acknowledges how much his art owed to the inspiration of the town, until a few years before the great Imperial Capital and still the great ecclesiastical and cultural centre of Spain - the town isolated on the plain of Castile which he had made his new home, so far from the island of his birth

39665-04madonn.jpg	The composition of the picture, opening out onto a landscape, is reminiscent of a type of portrait frequently used by Titian and his workshop. The position of the Madonna, whose lower body is mainly in the centre of the picture and whose upper body is turned to the left half, is a further example of Titian's unusual talent for composition - he was always finding new ways of developing long-established pictorial formulas.The large heavy figure in this picture can be compared to the sculptures of Sansovino and Michelangelo.

24033-0sposi2.jpg	The space of the room with a square plan (8,1 x 8,1 m) is essentially a cube, and in it Mantegna has created a monumental architectural reality by means of ribs on the ceiling connecting with pilasters on the walls, which are in turn supported by a marble socle. In the centre of the ceiling is the much-admired oculus, opening onto a painted sky. The interplay of levels of reality elaborates ideas already set forth in his art. Only the corbels are actually stone, the highly worked ribs, the garlands that encircle the eight busts of emperors supported by putti, and the ensembles in decorative lozenges are painted to simulate marble so convincingly that even the modern viewer is sometimes fooled. In the triangular spaces at the edges of the ceiling are twelve mythological scenes of Orpheus, Orion, and Hercules with backgrounds of simulated mosaics, a device that Raphael was to use in the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura. Only two of the walls have figurative narrations: the north wall with a scene that is usually called the Court and the west wall, divided into three scenes, Servants with Horse and Dogs, the Inscription with Putti, and the Meeting. The remaining two walls are painted with imitation leather draperies that encroach upon the other sides as well to create the fiction that there were curtains before all four walls and on two sides they had been opened up to reveal the events depicted.The central subject of the frescoes is Ludovico III Gonzaga, his wife, his children, and his court. A closed letter held by Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga in the Meeting seems to be the same one, now opened, that Ludovico, seated majestically, holds in the Court, and must be considered important for understanding the paintings. The style of the frescoes is similar to Mantegna's previous works. The compositions are dominated by the narrative elements, with the figures set frieze-like, close to the picture plane within a narrow spatial shelf in front of a landscape or architectural setting

18969-giustini.jpg	Vincenzo Giustiniani (1564-1637) was one of the most brilliant, and knowledgeable lovers of art in early seventeenth-century Rome. He assembled a renowned collection of roughly 1.800 works of classical sculpture and 600 paintings, among them eleven of Caravaggio's most important works. He purchased a villa at Bassano Romano in 1595 which was then thoroughly remodeled and enlarged. The artists who painted there between 1595 and 1604 all worked in the Mannerist style.The north wing of the enlarged palace was erected in 1607-09 and the painted decoration was accomplished in 1609-10. There are three rooms in the north wing, the Sala della Felicit&#224; Eterna (painted by Paolo Guidotti in 1610), the Sala di Diana (painted by Domenichino in 1609) and the Galleria (painted by Francesco Albani and assistants in 1609-10).In the Sala della Felicit&#224; Eterna the ceiling is devoted to eternal happiness. It was painted by Paolo Guidotti, an eccentric who combined Mannerism and naturalism in a way that was both original and bizarre. The pictorial program celebrates the virtues of the villa's owner and his wife by way of personifications and Old Testament scenes

Christ, accompanied by three disciples, appears in the picture's second plane. The figure, standing to the left of the Baptist, but turned away from him, has been painted across the corner and belongs to the scene on the north wall (the Baptist's Sermon in the Wilderness).

29181-5birth.jpg	The scenes from the life of the Virgin, depicted on the inner sides of the wings, begin with the birth of Christ. Mary and Joseph worship the child in the stable, while outside  in the fields angels announce the birth of the Lord to the shepherds. Full of curiosity, a crowd of men and women look on from behind the wooden fence of the stable. The next scene shows the adoration of the Three Wise Men who had followed the star to offer the child gold, frankincense and myrrh. The third scene, the Feast of Pentecost, shows the Virgin and the Apostles in a chapel-like room. Above them is suspended the dove of the Holy Spirit, which is poured out over the faithful. The final picture is of the death of the Virgin. Christ stands at her deathbed and has taken his mother's soul, in the shape of a tiny girl, into his arms

26274-09menzel.jpg	Menzel's oils of the 1850s and 1860s presented dazzling tableaux of a vastly wealthy, conspicuously refined Potsdam court under Frederick the Great (1712-1786), depicted as if on the same gargantuan plane as Versailles, in a Prussian palace more French than the one near Paris. The Allegiance of the Silesian Diet before Frederick II in Breslau, signed and dated 1855, is an early example. His habitually powerful re-creative imagination makes these canvases look as if he were working after a lost depiction of the subject by an eyewitness. Knowing his audience required a massively detailed approach, Menzel turned to a Dutch seventeenth-century precedent - the skilled reportage and engaged eye of Gerard Terborch, whose work was still very popular in the nineteenth century

39805-05charle.jpg	At the beginning of 1548 Titian left Venice for Augsburg where he met Charles V, fresh from his great victory over the Protestant League at M�hlberg. At Augsburg (where he remained until October 1548) he was kept busy painting, chiefly, portraits of the Emperor and important members of his court.Like the painting representing the Emperor at M�hlberg, this portrait was painted during the imperial Diet of Augsburg in 1548. It is, however, thought that Titian did not create the work single-handedly. There is an awkwardness in the foreshortening of the perspective of the chair; and the red carpet is an isolated colour contrast, very unusual in Titian's work. But there are also areas of high quality. The face, above all, demonstrates a fine power of observation. The deformation of Charles' lower jaw has been skillfully concealed. The intimate atmosphere of the painting, which contains no regal affectations, is unusual in Titian's portraits of rulers

05263-1paradi1.jpg	It has been assumed that the Paradise and Hell panels, inspired by a panel of Dirk Bouts, once formed the wings of a Last Judgment altarpiece; more probably, however, they were originally intended as independent works illustrating the rewards and pains of the Particular Judgment. The pictures have been disfigured by heavy overpainting and darkened varnish, and critics are not unanimous in attributing them to Bosch; nevertheless, it would be difficult to ascribe their compositions to anyone else. In the Paradise pair, the left-hand panel depicts the elect shepherded by angels into a rolling landscape from which rises the Fountain of Life; this is the Terrestrial Paradise, a sort of intermediate stage where the saved were cleansed of the last stain of sin before being admitted into the presence of God. Already one group of souls looks expectantly upwards

00671-baptist1.jpg	This is a celebrated picture. Although actually disfigured by bad restorations in old times which have changed the background and diminished the splendor and especially the interrelation of colors, there still remains the frank, original and lively conception of this youthful figure.The impressive image of the young Baptist, of an evocative power that in this case also one might call pre-Baroque, emerges from a dark grey background in which one glimpses the slightly pinkish rockface of a grotto. The athletic figure, the animal skin and the cloak are thrown into relief by a dramatic light that still illumines wonderful pictorial effects visible in the better preserved parts, such as the cross made of cane in the lower corner. These are the effects that will be taken up again by many of the Florentine painters of the 17th century

14825-ascensio.jpg	This panel, which comes from a nave chapel (fifth to the left) in the church of Santa Maria in Vado in Ferrara, was removed to Rome after the devolution of the Duchy of Ferrara to the domains of the papacy in 1598. In the same group of paintings transported from Ferrara to Rome were the Deposition by Ortolano, now in the Galleria Borghese, and the altarpiece with the Madonna, St Anthony the Abbot and St Cecilia, now in the National Gallery at Palazzo Barberini. By 1612, the work had already been replaced by a copy commissioned to fill its place in the chapel. The original later entered into the celebrated collection of Cardinal Flavio Chigi.Vasari, who describes Garofolo's Ascension in his writings, considered it to be a fundamental work of this Ferrarese painter, who was closely connected to the church for which the painting was intended. Raphaelesque influences are evident here, especially when one compares Garofolo's work to Raphael's Transfiguration. Strong similarities exist between this work and other paintings by Garofalo dating to 1519-20, such as the 1520 Resurrection in the Archpretal church of Bondeno, and the 1519 Massacre of the Innocents.

20096-23hooch.jpg	This portrait of a prosperous family in a private garden is one of the most distinctive works of the Delft school. In the figures as well as in the setting, the painting is remarkable for its synthesis of naturalism and formality.In this work De Hooch represented three generations of this unidentified family, who have posed informally in their best clothes as though they had come together spontaneously for a Sunday afternoon visit. The patriarch of the family sits squarely in the foreground, his feet firmly planted on the brick walkway that leads to the open door in the wooden wall separating their courtyard from the next. His wife turns toward him holding in her hand a bunch of grapes she has taken from the fruit bowl, a gesture that contemporary viewers familiar with emblematic imagery of the day would have understood to represent fertility and fecundity. Their daughter sits with them, while behind her stand her husband on the steps and their son. The couple at the left, probably the patriarch's son and his wife, stand before a wall covered with roses, the symbol of love, while she holds a peach, emblematic of love and sincerity. Reinforcing the pictorial message that this is a God-fearing, law-abiding family that appreciates the blessings bestowed on them is the distant presence of the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church), whose distinctive tower is seen rising beyond the orange-tile rooftops

38300-whistle.jpg	The great growth of interest in the natural sciences in the latter part of the eighteenth century stimulated the production of pictorial publications. Illustration often played a central part in such works, particularly since these sciences were at a stage when direct observation could lead to new discoveries. As well as being commissioned to make illustrations, there were many artists who were themselves amateur naturalists and who used their observational skills to publish scientific studies of great visual beauty. Many of these have remained unsurpassed on a scientific as well as an aesthetic level. The work of the great English animal painter Stubbs is an example of this. His Anatomy of the Horse remains the standard work of the subject

08047-self_por.jpg	"Sources describe Rosalba Carriera as reticent: chaste, bourgeois, worthy pleasant enough in her manner, but with something of the old maid about her. In 1746 an eye complaint forced her to abandon her career, and the end of her life was marked by deep depression.The artist's self-portrait, dating from 1715, gives us some inkling of the many sides of her personality. The picture was commissioned by the house of Medici, in whose Florentine portrait gallery the already famous painter was to take her place. We see her slightly inclining to one side, her gaze confidently directed towards us. While the smile on her lips is barely noticeable, the friendly eyes are a little serious. In her left hand the painter is holding a ""picture within a picture"", on which she is placing a brush with her right hand. In this way she is presenting to us her sister Giovanna, who was so to speak the unmarried artist's alter ego and housekeeper. Only with her help could Rosalba Carriera carry out her portrait commissions as she did"

20789-lazarus1.jpg	"The name by which Spanish documents refer to Juan de Flandes simply means ""John or Jan of Flanders."" Juan is first recorded as working for Queen Isabel in 1496; two years later he is mentioned as her court artist.Juan de Flandes demonstrated a preference for clearly articulated space and refined color schemes. Characteristic of paintings from the city of Ghent, charming narrative vignettes frequently enlivened the backgrounds of Juan's pictures.The Nativity is one of the six surviving panels of an altarpiece from the main chapel in the Church of San L�zaro, Palencia, in northern Castile.Juan's Nativity, as with many religious scenes, amplifies a biblical episode with theological references. The Gospel of Luke writes that the baby was wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. Here, however, the child is naked and lies on his mother's robe upon the ground, implying that the son of god was poorer than the humblest son of man. The ox and ass, eating from the straw-filled manger, are not mentioned together in Luke. The Book of Isaiah, however, states that these beasts knew their master and his crib. Since a grain storage crib relates directly to Luke's feeding manger, early Christian scholars believed that Isaiah's prophesy was fulfilled when even the livestock would recognize Jesus as their master.Meanwhile, illuminating the starry night, concentric rings of divine light emanate from the angel appearing to the shepherds on the distant hilltop. Perched on the ruined stable, an owl may refer to the nocturnal darkness dispelled by the coming of Christ."

33935-atalantb.jpg	This composition is calculated and refined. It highlights the contradictory gestures of the unbeatable athlete Atalanta bending down to pick up the golden apple dropped by Hippomenes. Thanks to his stratagem, the youth is about to win the contest. The idea of movement is rendered almost exclusively by the billowing cloaks. The ivory smooth bodies of the two contestants clearly stand out remarkably against the gray-brown background.There are two versions of this paining, one in Naples and another in Madrid, and recently there have been heated debates about both their autography and dating. While most scholars recognize the Madrid canvas as an autograph work, there have been serious reservations about the Neapolitan canvas, deemed it a workshop copy.

03319-portwoma.jpg	Bartolomeo Veneto, who was active in Veneto and Lombardy, painted predominantly portraits and religious works. He managed to combine the various Italian styles  with the Northern influences as few others were able. His prime abilities included a great flair for realism and an extraordinary attention to detail which enabled him to obtain numerous commissions from wealthy clients, particularly for his consummate portraits.This panel, which bears the name of the ancient goddess of spring, Flora, is actually a portrait of an unknown young woman, often identified as the infamous Lucrezia Borgia, the daughter of Pope Alexander VI. The half-nude is portrayed against a black background in three-quarter profile, turning to the left but still maintaining eye contact with the viewer. She is dressed in a white tunic which exposes her left breast. In her upraised right hand she delicately holds a small bouquet of various flowers, composed of anemones, daisies, and buttercups, which she appears to offer the viewer with a self-assured gaze

43963-4luke.jpg	The figures are seen in a vaulted portico opening onto an inner garden. The space is situated in a fortress raised above earthly life, the city below and the river landscape. Seated on the step of a wooden throne, over which a canopy is hung, the Virgin is suckling the Child. St Luke sits in front of her. With one knee resting on a cushion, he is drawing her portrait with a silver point on a sheet of paper or parchment supported by a small plank. The Virgin's head and features have already been worked out. The drawing is intended as a preparatory sketch, which causes the theme to be interpreted as taking place in real time, as well as emphasizing the artist's ability to record the divine, and thus, as it were, to prove its existence. The activity depicted in the painting probably reflects accurately the way in which, in the fifteenth century, a painted portrait was prepared by means of a preliminary drawing (the best-known example is Van Eyck's drawing with the portrait of Cardinal Albergati in Dresden). In the adjacent room behind St Luke lies an open book, probably an allusion to his gospel, and the ox, his emblem. It remains unclear why the scroll is not inscribed with his name.The low position of the Virgin, seated in front of her throne, corresponds to the type of the Virgin of Humility, a motif derived from St Luke's Gospel. On the arm of the throne the Fall of Man is depicted, which is connected with the role of Jesus and Mary as the new Adam and Eve. The two small figures looking over the crenellated wall are sometimes linked with Joachim and Anna, Mary's parents. In the background on the left is a wooden corner-house with a signboard consisting of a stick on which copper dishes are hanging. More of these can also be seen in the display-window. This same house often appears in the work of Rogier van der Weyden and the Master of Fl�malle and it has been erroneously taken for a shop of painters' materials. In fact it concerns a surgeon's house. The pans were used during blood-letting. In the context of this painting the connection with the figure of St Luke, who was also a doctor, is not imaginary. His clothing too, with the exception of the evangelist's inkpot hanging from his belt, is in fact that of a doctor.St Luke as the portrait painter of the Virgin was originally probably intended to be symbolical, because his gospel deals with the Virgin Mary in the greatest detail. In his capacity as an artist, he came to be the patron saint of the painters' guilds from the fourteenth century onwards. The composition is the oldest preserved example of a St Luke painting the portrait of an actually present Mother of God.There exist three other examples of this composition, identical apart from a few details, of which the one in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, since its restoration in 1932-33, is regarded by most art historians as the original (other examples in Munich, Alte Pinakothek, and St Petersburg, Hermitage). The attribution to Rogier van der Weyden was made on stylistic grounds and has never been contested. The date, on account of the still strong link with the Master of Fl�malle (emphasis on materiality and volume, rounded, broad, rolling drapery) and the resemblance to Jan van Eyck's Virgin of Chancellor Rolin (Paris, Mus�e du Louvre), has been situated in his early period (1435-36). To judge by the technique the examples of Bruges, Munich and St Petersburg were only made towards the end of the fifteenth or even in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Although they are very faithful copies, they appear on comparison each to have a style of its own with occasionally a remarkable kinship with well-known Brussels painters such as the Magdalene Master (St Petersburg) and of the Master of the Embroidered Foliage (Munich). The Bruges version is more difficult to situate. It seems to be of higher quality than the copies of Munich and St Petersburg, and is certainly the best preserved.The composition was enormously popular in the second half of the fifteenth century, when the abundant production of half-length Virgins started to undergo its morphological influence. It gave rise to a host of pastiche-like borrowings of loose elements. Hans Memling was inspired by the architectural setting and the background of Rogier's painting when creating his Virgin Enthroned of Kansas City

Whether this is a reflection of Goya's own mental state, or an allegory on the situation in a country that was consuming its own children in bloody wars and revolutions, or a statement on the human condition generally, may remain open.

03861-137alle4.jpg	The four panels with Allegories at the Accademia in Venice are often likened to the Sacred Allegory, but they belong instead to the artist's scanty secular production. They originally formed part of a small dressing-table with a mirror and a rack on which to hang objects, belonging to the painter Vincenzo Catena who, writing his will in 1530, left it to Antonio Marsili. The spread of this kind of furniture was so great that in 1489 the Venetian Senate prohibited its manufacture, limiting it to what was strictly necessary. Often, as in this instance, their decoration comprised symbolic representations of a moralistic character.An unusual theme for Bellini, the panels represent respectively: Lust tempting the virtuous man or Perseverance (Bacchus who from a chariot offers a plate of fruit to a warrior); fickle Fortune (the woman on an unstable boat holding a sphere); Prudence (the naked woman pointing at a mirror); Falsehood (the man emerging from the shell). There are diverging opinions about the interpretation of the last two representations, such that they have been seen as: the Woman as Vanitas (on the basis of similar representations by Jacopo de' Barbari and Baldung Grien), and the Man in the shell as an allegory of Virtus Sapientia, since the shell might have a positive connotation as a generative principle

38238-charity.jpg	St Lawrence was a Christian martyr of Spanish birth who died in Rome in 258, one of the most venerated saints since the 4th century. He was ordained deacon by Pope Sixtus II and met his death shortly after the pope's own martyrdom. Tradition has it that the pope, when arrested, instructed Lawrence to give away to the poor the church's treasures, consisting of precious vessels and money, for which, as deacon, he was responsible. No sooner had he done so than Lawrence was ordered by the Roman prefect to surrender them to him, whereupon Lawrence, indicating the poor and sick around him, said, 'Here are the treasures of the Church'. For this he was condemned to be roasted on a gridiron, a torture he underwent with equanimity, merely observing, 'See, I am done enough on one side, now turn me over and cook the other'.This is one of the earliest and best versions of a painting by Strozzi that enjoyed great popularity and that was repeated many times by the artist. In this series of similar versions the Rome painting was probably preceded only by a canvas in the Royal Palace in Genoa, which has a reversed composition. The proposed dating of the picture is 1615-20, before the creation of most of the other replicas and before the creation of a later, completely different version of the same subject that belongs to the artist's Venetian sojourn (c. 1630-1644). This dating places the canvas in a period when Strozzi was adopting a new naturalism after coming into contact with Caravaggio's works in Genoa. At the same time, however, he did not abandon the lessons learned from the Tuscans, above all from Matteo Rosselli. The Caravaggesque influences are evident here in the accentuated definition of the light-dark contrasts and in the composition of a scene with four half-figures.Stylistically close to the Calling of St Matthew now in Worcester, this painting is considered the chief masterpiece of Strozzi's early career

13545-certosa6.jpg	The Lay Brothers' Choir in the Certosa was used by the unconsecrated members of the community who provided the physical labour required for housekeeping. Its sumptuous decoration makes it one of the more outstanding of the charterhouse's common spaces. Striking accents of this room are the frescoes by Domenico Gargiulo covering all the walls with small-figure picture panels and the elegant choir stool made by Francesco d'Arezzo. Contributing to the harmonious impression of the overall space is the stucco decor in muted colours, like the richly adorned lavabo, harkens back to Cosimo Fanzago. It was Fanzago who was also responsible for the architectural arrangement of the space, which simulates a partially open loggia whose imaginary openings are hung with tapestries.The fresco cycle, complex in its subject matter, is dominated by Old Testament scenes supplemented by small-format events from the New Testament. The six sham tapestries above the choir stool present scenes devoted to specific lay brothers or the role of the lay brothers in the community

36465-tobias.jpg	In Tobias and the Angel, the Brescian artist Giovanni Gerolamo Savoldo depicts the biblical episode in which a heavenly travelling companion tells the young Tobias to catch a fish and use its bile to cure his father's blindness. Savoldo has here produced a synthesis of his research into the effects of nature on the human figure, on drapery and on foliage, which appears to be pierced by light, and on the quality of colours seen in the distance, by adopting methods taught by Leonardo.

03606-70holyfa.jpg	Domenico Beccafumi was one of the first and most important Tuscan artists to work in the Mannerist style. He began his career painting in a style close to artists of the turn of the century such as Fra Bartolomeo and Perugino. After a period in Rome his work shows the influence of Michelangelo and Raphael.This work is an early example of the Mannerist style of the 1530s and 1540s. The composition is based on a triangular structure, marked out by the Virgin and Child. Beccafumi uses typical Mannerist colours in the lime green and blue of the Virgin's robe, as well as the pale pink other dress and the touches of orange.

17006-nuenen21.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 166, JH 850.During the summer of 1885 van Gogh decided to prepare a multi-figure genre scene by chalk drawings depicting peasants working on the fields, following the example of Jean-Fran�ois Millet. Due to the negative criticism of his The Potato Eaters, he abandoned the stiffness and flatness of his figures and he took more care in modelling. In July, he tried his new style on some small studies in oil. We know about ten such paintings, most of which depict peasants digging, or potato planting, or harvesting.

44519-abraham.jpg	Zanchi came to Venice as a very young man and was trained in the style of the tenebrosi. For the devotees of this strict form of Caravaggesque painting, contact with the early work of Luca Giordano (who sojourned in Venice between 1650 and 1654) was fundamental. But Zanchi, a cultivated man and the author of a treatise (unfortunately surviving in only fragmentary form), built his style on the local figurative traditions of the sixteenth century: the freedom of handling and muted tonalities of late Titian, Veronese's treatment of light, and the atmospheric effects of Tintoretto.The subject of the present painting, fairly rare in seventeenth-century paining, was described by Josephus in his Early History of the Jews. The episode relates that Abraham came to know God not through reading the Scriptures but by studying the stars.In this painting, the composition revolves around a huge globe of the world lit by a merciless light. It is an unusual subject for a Tenebrist painter

36806-doria_a.jpg	"Andrea Doria (1466-1560) was the dominant figure in Genoa in his times. He was an extraordinarily talented naval commander. Coming from an impoverished branch of an ancient local family, he succeeded in enriching himself and reestablishing Genoese independence after protracted domination by the French. His fellow citizens named him Principe (Prince) and Pater Patriae (Father of the Homeland).Sebastiano's nickname, Piombo (Lead), derived from his sinecure as ""Piombatore"" (Sealer in the Papal Chancery). He preferred gray slate as a support for his pictures and painted his portrait of the Genoan patrician in the colour of slate, with a shadowy, gloomy mound projected on the background, a disquieting motif - 'umbram suam metuit?' For the Venetian artist Sebastiano Luciani the colour gray, which is never bright in his paintings but always dark, dull, and heavy, must have had serious and fairly negative psychological implications. Yet it is also true that the reflections of light on lead are intense and where there is much shade, there is also much light: 'lumina inter umbras clariora sunt,' especially in the work of a painter whose name, according to ancient myths, brings good fortune and is equivalent to a star.The maritime symbols - including an anchor, a beaked prow, a helm, and other parts of an ancient ship - allude to the subject's rank as Admiral of the Fleet. They are taken from an Imperial Roman marble frieze that in the painter's time was on display in the basilica of San Lorenzo Fuori Le Mura and is now in the Museo Capitolino"

39825-3vasto.jpg	Alfonso d'Avalos d'Aquino, Marchese di Pescara e del Vasto (1502-1546) was an Italian condottiero. Having fought at the Battle of Pavia, he later commanded the Imperial army in Italy during the Italian War of 1542 and was defeated by the French at the Battle of Ceresole.The Marchese del Vasto Addressing his Troops is a defence of the Marchese's actions in 1537, when he quelled a mutiny by controversial financial concessions to his troops. The composition depends on an antique prototype, the 'allocutio', where troops affirm their loyalty to the Emperor. In this case, however, since they are in a state of mutiny, they crowd round the dais rather threateningly. The choice of a classical format may relate to the renewed study, in the Renaissance and especially in Venice, of military textbooks by the 3rd and 4th-century authors Aelian and Vegetius, in particular with regard to improving discipline and organization. The Marquis and his troops admittedly wear contemporary armor, but the Marquis' son Ferrante, whom he had offered up as a hostage to his men, is in the garb of the Roman legions.Aretino's face among the troops reflects his interest in del Vasto's campaigns, as recorded in his letters and pamphlets

Paola took with her the chests as part of her dowry when she married Count Leonhard of Gorizia in 1477. The brightly painted bas-relief scenes, made after drawings by Mantegna, represent episodes illustrating the legendary fairness of the Roman emperor Trajan. They are set in a triumphal procession including a great crowd of antique figures; in the background is an imaginary city that looks more like contemporary Florence than ancient Rome

17138-arles60.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 499, JH 1636.In October 1888 van Gogh realized a long-cherished plan to persuade Paul Gauguin, whose acquaintance he had made in Paris, to come to Arles, settle in the Yellow House, and found a Studio of the South. Gauguin had been working in Brittany with �mile Bernard and several other Parisian painters. Van Gogh had kept in close contact with this group through his correspondence with Bernard and by exchanges of work. He attempted to extend this system of exchanging information by encouraging Gauguin and Bernard to paint portraits of each other to send to him; he would paint a self-portrait for them. In the end Gauguin and Bernard did the same and sent him self-portraits. All the paintings in this project had the status of an artistic manifesto.In early December 1888 van Gogh began a pair of pendant paintings of chairs, Gauguin's and his own. These pictures are not just still-lifes, however much the iconography is reminiscent of the allegorical use of motifs in seventeenth-century Dutch still-life. The flame of a candle, for instance, is a commonplace in these, symbolizing light and life. But these paintings are also oblique portraits. On Gauguin's chair van Gogh has placed two books, recognizable from the colour of their covers as contemporary French novels. On his own chair he has placed a pipe and a tobacco pouch, and in the background there are sprouting onions. Gauguin's Chair is a night scene; his own, a daylight scene

32273-02xavier.jpg	This painting was commissioned in 1638 by Sublet de Noyers, in Paris and installed in spring 1642 on the high altar of a newly built church for Jesuit noviciates. It shows a scene from the life of St Francis Xavier, one of the joint founders of the Jesuit Order, who during his mission in Japan brought a dead girl back to life. Summoned by the prayers of the saint, Christ appears in the company of angels and restores the deceased to the living. The painting offered Poussin the opportunity to measure himself against his arch rival Vouet, who - along with Poussin's friend Jacques Stella - had been commissioned to produce a work for one of the side altars. Poussin was not entirely happy, however, with the circumstances under which his altarpiece arose: it was the largest canvas he ever executed in terms of dimensions, and although he considered its composition a success he was obliged to complete it in a great rush.Poussin based the figure of Christ on that in Raphael's Transfiguration

01105-port_man.jpg	Tradition has it that when Antonello da Messina returned from Flanders he introduced the technique of oil painting to Venice. He was also influenced by northern painting in his Sicilian search for the individual character of people and things, as is evident from the extraordinary Portrait of a Man, circa 1475. His objective and incisive analysis of forms combines Piero della Francesca's stereometric achievements, Mantegna's use of perspective in his busts and Venetian colour. Its present state of preservation shows that the highlighting on the red robe, has now become blackened by the lead base of the white pigment.By the 1470s Netherlandish pictures were being imported to Venice in great numbers, together with some of the Netherlandish-inspired portraits by Antonello da Messina. While Antonello's portraits show less of the figure and the surrounding space than earlier Venetian examples, their sharp lighting from the left, strongly individualised expressions, and outward-turned eyes give them a powerful physical and personal presence

05193-05ecce1.jpg	Among the works generally ascribed to Bosch's first period of activity (c. 1470-85) may be included several small biblical scenes: the Epiphany (Adoration of the Magi) in Philadelphia, the Ecce Homo in Frankfurt (with a related version in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts) and an altar wing in Vienna, the Christ Carrying the Cross. Their early date is suggested by their relatively simple compositions and their adherence to traditional compositional types.In the Ecce Homo, crowned with thorns and his flesh beaten raw by the scourge, Christ stands with Pilate and his companions before the angry mob. The dialogue between Pilate and the crowd is indicated by the Gothic inscriptions. From the mouth of Pilate issue the words Ecce Homo (Behold the Man). There is no need to decipher the inscription Crufige Eum (Crucify Him), the cry which rises from the people below; their animosity is unmistakably conveyed by their facial expressions and threatening gestures. The third inscription Salve nos Christe redemptor (Save us, Christ Redeemer) once emerged from two donors at lower left, but their figures have been painted over. The heathen character of the men surrounding Christ is suggested by their strange dress and headgear, including pseudo-oriental turbans. The scene's essential wickedness is further indicated by such traditional emblems of evil as the owl in the niche above Pilate and the giant toad sprawled on the back of a shield carried by one of the soldiers. In the background appears a city square, the Turkish crescent fluttering from one of its towers. The enemies of Christ have been identified with the power of Islam which in Bosch's day, and long afterwards, controlled the most holy places of Christendom. The buildings, however, are late Gothic; only the oddly bulging tower in the distance evokes a feeling of far-off places.The Dutch character of this early work is unmistakable. The homely faces and animated gestures of Christ's tormentors recall Passion scenes in Dutch manuscripts of the second and third quarters of the fifteenth century, where we encounter similar physical types, slight in proportion, flatly modelled and often unsubstantial beneath their heavy robes

42551-06gread.jpg	"Signature: Traces of signature (?).Provenance: Acquired in 1724 by August III, elector of Saxony, together with a number of other paintings bought in Paris. The seller threw in the picture as a present, to sweeten the deal. It was then attributed to Rembrandt, and the ascription was subsequently weakened to ""manner"" or ""school of."" In 1783, it was engraved as a work by Govaert Flinck. The name ""Van der Meer from Delft"" occurred for the first time in a catalog dating from 1806, to be changed back to Flinck in 1817. From 1826 to 1860, the appellation was altered to Pieter de Hooch. It is only since 1862 that the correct identification obtains. The only Dutch provenance that could possibly apply is the sale Pieter van der Lip, Amsterdam, 1712, no. 22, ""A Woman Reading in a Room, by van der Meer of Delft fl 110."" Unfortunately, the text is not specific enough to distinguish it from the one at the Rijksmuseum, Woman in Blue Reading a Letter.The above underlines the difficulties inherent to the establishment of Vermeer's catalog. Not a single work can be traced back to the painter's studio, nor are there any letters or contracts extant. The task of attribution rests squarely upon the shoulders of the individual critic, which explains the multiplicity of divergent opinions. In this painting, a young woman stands in the center of the composition, facing in profile an open window to the left. In the foreground is a table covered with the same Oriental rug encountered in the Woman Asleep. On it is the identical Delft plate with fruit. The window reflects the girl's features, while to the right the large green curtain forms a deceptive frame. She is precisely silhouetted against a bare wall that reflects the light and envelops her in its luminosity.We are here confronted with one of the salient aspects of Vermeer's sensibility and originality. It is the stillness that stands out, the inner absorption, the remoteness from the outer world. She concentrates entirely upon the letter, holding it firmly and tautly, while she absorbs its content with utmost attention.In the technique, the artist avows again Rembrandtesque derivation. He paints in small fatty dabs to model the forms, and obtains the desired effects by means of impasto highlights opposed to the deeper tonalities - just as the master from Leyden was wont to do. The painting is relatively large, and the smallness of the figure as opposed to its surroundings stresses immateriality and depersonalization. Vermeer considerably changed the composition in the course of execution.Much has been written about the trompe-l'oeil effect of the curtain. It is a pictorial artifice used by many other Dutch masters and in keeping with an old European tradition. Rembrandt, Gerard Dou, Nicolaes Maes, and many still-life and even landscape painters made use of such curtains as a means of simulating effects that now seem theatrical. The light background can be found in many paintings by Carel Fabritius, the Goldfinch from 1654 at the Mauritshuis in The Hague being the most famous example"

23265-08jerome.jpg	In Venetian Renaissance art, St Jerome was portrayed either seated and reading in his study or kneeling in penitence in the wilderness. The two themes were sometimes combined, as in Giovanni Bellini's portrayal of Jerome reading in the wilderness. Lotto's painting in the Louvre is a variant of this type, and it is the earliest of at least five depictions of St Jerome by Lotto. Taken in chronological order, these works show a striking development in his treatment of the theme. The earliest painting in the series is the most dependent on the artist's sources of inspiration, Bellini and D�rer, however, it manages to be remarkably personal. Lotto's conception of St Jerome, with his wrinkled flesh, domed head, and long beard, derives from Bellini's example, but the pose, seated, with the legs drawn up, is quite distinctive. The source for his landscape, especially the vertical rock formations, is D�rer's engraving of St Jerome

09375-lock.jpg	The English artist John Constable is one of the greatest of European landscape painters, whose handling of light and colour was admired by the masters of Barbizon and the Impressionists, among others.The painting in Madrid represents the locks of Flatford Mill on the Stour. Constable knew the place from childhood, because his father owned the mill. Every work the artist exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1812 to 1825 included a view of the Stour Valley.Constable made several studies outdoors for his large-format pictures. In preparation for The Lock, he travelled from his residence in Hampstead outside London to Dedham in spring 1823. The finished paintings never adhered slavishly to such sketches, but rather modified natural appearances in the service of the picture's message.The principal effect of the composition derives from the landscape scene itself, which is characterized above all by the treatment of light. The light seems to fluctuate before our eyes, analogously to the meteorological interplay in the sky In his differentiation of lighting effects under clouds of varying density Constable relied largely on seventeenth-century Dutch Baroque landscapes, especially those of Jacob van Ruisdael.

06972-death_c.jpg	"Cagnacci's familiarity with the work of Guido Reni and the masters of the Bolognese manner, and his stay in Rome and encounter with Caravaggio's painting, were a vital influence on his work. The Death of Cleopatra was painted during the period when the artist's broad figurative range was enriched by the Dutch pictures he had seen in Vienna. An outstanding example of Cagnacci's art, the painting is part of the long tradition of nudes that were painted under the pretext of representing mythological subjects. The sweet sensuality and languid amorous fatigue of the blond young woman contrast with the stiff and angular armchair. The entire composition is built up on an ""architectural"" system of regular units of form which does not allow for any ambiguity in the representation but rigorously supports the pictorial creation.
