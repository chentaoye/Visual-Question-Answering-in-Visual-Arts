03439-10summer.jpg	Jacopo Bassano was a painter of religious scenes and a discerning portraitist but he primarily owes his fame to the invention of an utterly new genre, one that combined pastoral themes with biblical and allegorical subjects. His depictions of the seasons - unique in cinquecento Italian painting - were probably inspired by Pieter Bruegel's, Pieter Aertsen's and Joachim Beuckelaer's works and scored great and lasting success. Bassano's workshop painted innumerable replicas of these compositions, which came to be known even beyond the Alps through prints, in particular those made by the members of the Sadeler family.In this painting the theme of summer is introduced by a scene of sheep-shearing and a woman pausing for repose with three children. The three scenes in the middle ground - harvesting, gathering, and thrashing the crop - confirm that the episode takes place in summer. In the background on the left, the sketchily depicted figures are engaged in the scene of the sacrifice of Isaac

21230-breakfas.jpg	Around 1870, growing numbers of Scandinavian (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish) artists took to visiting Paris, the modern metropolis with its many-sided art scene. They attended the school of L�on Bonnat, or the Acad�mie Julian, or the Acad�mie Colarossi. Some of them were tutored by  Jean-L�on G�r�me. When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Gr�z-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods.In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark. Many Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish artists returned there every summer, to paint in the fine northern light in the company of friends old and new.There is a direct continuity from plein-airisme of the true outdoor kind to interiors that record the immediate effects of sunlight. The Skagen painters were particularly fond of this effect. Kr&#248;yer's Artists at Breakfast was a logical developments of motifs he had worked on previously in France. The painting portrays Danish, Norwegian and Swedish artists at table. The objects on the table stand out in the strong sunlight in red and green against the white cloth. The light effectively glows in Krohg's bushy gingery beard and catches the sleeve of Charles Lundh's jacket. The loose brushwork and inexact outlines highlight the sense that a lively and significant moment has been captured

06367-01carniva.jpg	With The Netherlandish Proverbs, also painted in 1559, this is the first in a series of allegories of human wickedness and foolishness which are based on the work of Hieronymus Bosch. The high viewpoint and the mass of small figures show strong compositional similarities to Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights, for example.This painting takes as its subject the traditional annual carnival which was held in Flemish towns and villages in the week before Lent. A half-religious, half-secular festival, it provided an excuse for excesses of drinking and sex. Bruegel stresses the opposition between the traditional enemies, Carnival and Lent, by representing their conflict as a joust. The two adversaries - the obese Carnival, seated astride a barrel and with a spit for a tilting lance, and the thin pinched figure of Lent, seated in a cart and using a baker's shovel as her weapon - come to blows in the square of a small Flemish town. The fat Lord of the Carnival astride the barrel is intended to represent the Protestants, the melancholy, lean figure with a beehive on his head, the Catholics. Bruegel is caricaturing both equally harshly.The immediate source for Bruegel's choice of the subject was an engraving by his own publisher, Hieronymus Cock, of a design by Frans Hogenberg, which had been published in the previous year, 1558.Certain motifs frequently recur in Bruegel's work. The group of cripples and beggars on Carnival's side of the square, ignored by the revellers, can be seen again (with some variations) in The Cripples of 1568, one of the artist's last paintings

32959-03sisti.jpg	The canvas with the Virgin, Child and Saints Sixtus and Barbara, usually called the Sistine Madonna, is characterized by an imaginary space created by the figures themselves. The figures stand on a bed of clouds, framed by heavy curtains which open to either side. The Virgin actually appears to descend from a heavenly space, through the picture plane, out into the real space in which the painting is hung. The gesture of St Sixtus and the glance of St Barbara seem to be directed toward the faithful, whom we imagine beyond the balustrade at the bottom of the painting. The Papal tiara, which rests on top of this balustrade, act as a bridge between the real and pictorial space.The painting was probably intended to decorate the tomb of Julius II, for the holy pope Sixtus was the patron saint of the Della Rovere family and St Barbara and the two winged 'genii' (visible at the bottom of the picture space) symbolize the funeral ceremony. The canvas was located in the convent of St Sixtus in Piacenza and was later donated by the monks to Augustus III, King of Saxony. It was carried to Moscow after the Second World War, and was later returned to Dresden.Generations of visitors to the Gem&#228;ldegalerie in Dresden have been deeply impressed by the way in which Raphael portrayed the Madonna in this painting. It has been reproduced over and over again, and almost everyone is familiar with the putti leaning on the balustrade. The Madonna appears from behind a curtain, confident and yet hesitant. The curtain gives the illusion of hiding her figure from the eyes of the onlooker and at the same time of being able to protect Raphael's painting

As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

44056-7sforza1.jpg	Around 1460 an altarpiece of remarkably irregular composition, known as the Sforza Triptych, was painted for Alessandro Sforza (1409-1479), a member of the Pesaro branch of the famous Sforza family of Milan. This altarpiece was the product either of Rogier's workshop or of another Brussels studio strongly influenced by his style. Alessandro Sforza is kneeling before the Crucifixion at the centre - his head was painted on a separate piece of foil and then stuck into the picture - with two members of his family who cannot be identified for certain. On the same level, the wings of the triptych show St Bavo and St Francis on the left, and St Catherine and St Barbara on the right. The division of the altarpiece into two zones is very unusual: it makes the Nativity of Christ and John the Baptist in the upper area of the wings appear to be above rather than behind the figures in the foreground of the lower area

05836-torture.jpg	The Hippolytus altarpiece and a number of other paintings from Holy Savour's Cathedral in Bruges were placed in the Groeninge Museum for conservation reasons in 1992.The left wing, with its portraits, clearly reveals the hand of the Ghent master Hugo van der Goes. It is impossible to say whether the painting was a collaborative effort or whether Van der Goes added the donors' portraits to an unfinished triptych.Bouts was a contemporary of Petrus Christus and was probably trained in his native Haarlem. Some time around 1447 he settled in Leuven where he received important ecclesiastical and municipal commissions. The central panel shows the martyrdom of Saint Hippolytus. His pale, slender body contrasts with the brightly coloured knights, whose outlines stand out against the steeply rising ground. The rarefied, seemingly emotionless atmosphere imbues Bouts' often cruel scenes with an oppressive silence. The coats of arms on the rear of the wings, which also feature grisailles of the respective patron saints, enable us to identify the donors as Hippolyte de Berthoz, Charles the Bold's treasurer, and his wife Elisabeth Hugheins. The painting must have been commissioned some time after 1468

44683-z_cock.jpg	Zoffany painted this picture for Warren Hastings, the British Governor General of Bengal from 1772 to 1785, under whose rule genuine co-operation flourished between the British and the Indians. His lively picture, executed in the notably relaxed court of the Nawab of Oudh, of a cock match between the Nawab's bird and that of the Englishman Colonel Mordaunt had no pictorial precedent, and revels instead in intimate detail, narrative and vivid colour. The British and Indians, while carefully differentiated, appear as equals in the contest and Mordaunt's pointed Indian slippers show him adopting the local fashions. If some of the British officers seem somewhat stiff, and the Indian servants excitable, the difference is as much of class or caste as of race, and it must be remembered that, as a German, Zoffany could observe each dispassionately. He has placed himself at the right of the scene, pencil in hand, looking on with sardonic amusement

05883-pirates.jpg	"B�cklin was one of the most celebrated and influential artists in central Europe in the later 19th century despite contemporary and posthumous criticism. His work is noted for its imaginative and idiosyncratic interpretation of themes from Classical mythology. Much of his prolific output consists of classical landscapes populated with such creatures as fauns and nymphs or such scenes as mermaids and mermen erotically frolicking. His most famous work is ""The Island of the Dead"" (five versions, 1880 and after) is not typical except in its theme of death and its joining of naturalism and fantasy. The Surrealists and artists such as de Chirico valued his work for its irrationality; his work, however, was not seriously considered again until the 1960s and 1970s"

The architecture, designed by the Venetian sculptor and architect Andriolo de' Santi was commissioned in 1372. This chapel was begun in 1372 in a privileged location inside the Basilica del Santo opposite the Cappella di Sant'Antonio (Chapel of St Anthony) and was completed, along with its painted decoration, in 1379.The painting school of Padua can be ranked as the most vigorous of the northern Italian schools: the painters of Padua built upon Giotto's achievements. The prolific Paduan fresco painters added striking naturalistic observations of their own in landscape, in the painting of animals, and in portraiture. The most successful painters of the period came to Padua from outside - Jacopo Avanzi from Bologna and Altichiero da Zevio from Verona. In the Chapel of St James, to Avanzi have been attributed most of the lunettes of the Life of St James, painted about 1374, while to Altichiero has been assigned the huge Crucifixion and some of the other lunettes

35620-04boarhu.jpg	In seventeenth-century Flemish painting 'dramatization' of the animal theme found expression in the revival of hunting scenes. (This special sub-category of animal painting emerged in the fifteenth century as an expression of late-medieval aristocratic art.) Rubens devoted himself to this subject after about 1616, initially with the intention of appealing to his aristocratic clientele. Some of his early hunting scenes were deliberately located in an aristocratic setting.Two phases can be distinguished in Rubens's hunting pictures. The work of the first period, running up to about 1620, is marked by a centripetal and diagonal scheme of composition, in which the many movement are clearly directed towards the high point of the dramatic action in the centre and in the 'depth' of the painting. In this manner the viewer's attention is drawn directly to the ultimate battle for life and death between man and beast. An example of these scenes is the Boar Hunt in Dresden.The hunting scenes Rubens painted after 1620 are in sharp contrast to the earlier scenes with vehement representations of violence. These later versions are composed in a frieze-like manner. The action is shown horizontally and parallel to the picture surface. This emphasises the actual progress of the hunt rather than  its climax, the life and death struggle between man and beast, ending in the slaughter of the beast. Wild animals are replaced by defenceless hunted deer, often in a mythological context such as in Diana Returning from Hunt.

20491-baptist.jpg	"St John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, although always portrayed as an ascetic in a hair shirt, was represented in several ways by the city's artists, from the sullen and reserved prophet - as he was usually shown by painters of the Trecento - to the exalted, over-refined figure of Botticelli, which inspired the painter of the present picture. This beardless youth with the gentle poise and sorrowful expression appeared in the role of St John the Baptist in the mid-1480s, in the first place on Botticelli's S. Barnaba altarpiece. There is reason to believe that this figure had become some kind of spiritual symbol in the eyes of the intellectual ""elite"" of the city, for in the next decade he reappeared over and over again in the paintings of other artists too.This canvas - earlier attributed to an anonymous follower of Botticelli - once may have been the procession banner of some religious society"

39535-conradin.jpg	There are two earlier versions of this subject taken from Johann Jakob Bodmer's (698-1783) poem Conradin von Schwaben. Conradin, Duke of Swabia (1252-68), the last scion of the house of Hohenstaufen, was captured by Charles of Anjou after his defeat at the battle of Tagliacozzo in 1268, and subsequently beheaded with his friend Frederick of Baden. Conradin was a keen chess player, a game he saw as symbolic of the struggle for power. The painting depicts the moment when he and his friend are informed by the judge Bary of their impending execution. The young Duke of Flanders weeps at this news, but Conradin and Frederick display only irritation at the interruption of their chess game

38446-14szinye.jpg	The artist who had an unbiased and humble approach to landscape attempted to create a clear and simple composition. He soon found diagonal composition which best suited his character and gestures, which kept on returning in a lot of his works in a number of variations. The picture shows again a slope, as in Picnic in May, or Snowbreak. As another compositional bravura, the artist placed figures walking uphill in the focus of a semi-circle of flowers. However small those figures are, they dominate the picture.Szinyei Merse started painting landscapes with poppies in 1895 which continued the colours of his youth. Like Monet of the Impressionists, Szinyei Merse also noticed that the contrast of red and green in the field full of poppies produced a fantastic vibration in the eyes of passers-by. The vibrating air around landscape and figures in the sunshine does not allow details to unfold. Thus, all elements of the picture merge with the harmony of uniform vision in spite of its intensive colours. The picture with poppies painted in Jernye in 1902 is the subtlest of all versions and expresses best what the Hungarian landscape looked like on a bright summer day

26626-3ceil_ho.jpg	In the scheme of divisions, the key elements are the thrones of the seers flanked by plinths and colonnettes decorated with pairs of putti supporting the cornice running above the crowns of the spandrels, at about a third of the way across the curve of the vault. Beyond the cornice, the vertical frames flanking the thrones are prolonged as the arches crossing the vault. They divide it into nine compartments in which the stories of Genesis - from the Separation of Light from Darkness to the Drunkenness of Noah - are represented as if they were seen above the space of the chapel, beyond and through the imposing structure of the painted architecture.In the five compartments above the thrones, the field of the narrative scenes is limited in size by the presence of four figures of ignudi, sitting on plinths and bearing garlands of oak leaves and acorns, and of two medallions painted to resemble bronze, with episodes drawn from the books of Genesis, Samuel, Kings, and Maccabees.Lastly, under the cornice and the thrones, in the spandrels and the lunettes at the tops of the walls, are depicted the forty generations of the Ancestors of Christ, from Abraham to Joseph, while the corner pendentives contain representations of biblical scenes associated with the theme of the divine protection of the Jews: Judith and Holofernes, David and Goliath, the Brazen Serpent, and the Punishment of Haman

01097-crucifiy.jpg	The painting represents Christ Crucified between two Evildoers, with Maria and John the Evangelist.In the work of the Sicilian painter Antonello da Messina the characteristics of 15th-century Flemish and Italian painting are combined in a very balanced way. Antonello, who lived in Naples from 1445, probably became acquainted with Flemish painting through works that were shipped from Bruges to Naples.In addition to this Venetian painting influenced Antonello when he stayed in the Lagoon City in 1475. Elements of this synthesis are already present in the Antwerp Crucifixion.A total of only 12 signed works by Antonello have been preserved. Ten of them are also dated. One of these is the Antwerp Crucifixion. The following text is written in tiny characters on a small piece of parchment on a piece of wood broken off from the crucifix in the left foreground: '1475 Antonellus Messaneus me pinxit.'

12570-4wolgemu.jpg	After he had achieved great fame, D�rer depicted the master who had taught him to paint. On it he inscribed: `This portrait was done by Albrecht D�rer of his teacher, Michael Wolgemut, in 1516', to which he later added, `and he was 82 years old, and he lived until 1519, when he departed this life on St Andrew's Day morning before sunrise.' It is unclear from the inscription whether Wolgemut was 82 when he died or when the portrait had been painted three years earlier.Michael Wolgemut (1434/7-1519) had one of the largest artist's workshops in Germany. D�rer had served his apprenticeship there from 1486 until 1489 and Wolgemut must have been proud to have witnessed his former pupil's rapid success. In D�rer's portrait, everything is focused on the head, set against a neutral green background. The old man's features are not disguised, from his sunken eyes and gaunt cheeks to the loose skin around his neck. Wolgemut wears a fur-lined coat and a simple hat or scarf, perhaps the headgear he would have worn in his workshop to keep off the dust. His eyes are still alert and he has a thoughtful expression. D�rer does not depict a pitiable man, but marvels at his indomitable spirit

21544-le_brun.jpg	In 1683 Largilli�re was accepted into the Academy, and in 1686 he submitted as his Diploma work the portrait of Le Brun, now in the Louvre. In this work he applies his Flemish methods to producing what is one of the most typical portraits of the Grand Si�cle. He creates a new genre, the state-portrait of an artist. Up till this time artists had usually painted themselves without any particular setting or apparatus. Some Flemish and Dutch painters are shown at work in their studio, surrounded by the actual furnishings of the place. Poussin had created a unique classical model with a background of mainly blank canvases, a sort of abstraction of a studio. Largillierre depicts Le Brun surrounded not by the actual appurtenances of a studio, but by objects symbolical of his achievement - the classical casts on which he based his style, the sketches for or engravings after his most celebrated works - just as in a royal portrait the King is shown with the attributes of the Monarchy

00987-4brisio.jpg	In the summer of 1447 Fra Angelico, assisted by Benozzo Gozzoli and several other minor artists, had painted a fresco of the Prophets in one of the triangular ceiling vaults and Christ the Judge in another in the Chapel of San Brizio, a large Gothic construction built around 1408 in the Orvieto Cathedral. The remaining sections of the ceiling were painted by Luca Signorelli in 1499-1502.In the quadrant adjacent to that show wing Christ the Judge, Angelico portrayed Old Testament prophets whose writings, it was believed, foretold the coming of Christ. Like Christ, they are painted against a golden ground and suspended on clouds, their garments radiant with the reflected light of his glory. Angelico varied their ages, appearance and attributes, conveying the personality of each man, from the introspective King David, fingering his harp as he composes his psalms, to Moses, his face and azure mantle glowing with the light of God.

03656-cherries.jpg	The composition of this dessert still-life represents an early phase of this genre. The picture shows two precious Chinese porcelain bowls from the Wan Li dinasty (1573-1619) - modern import products at the time - filled with strawberries and cherries, as well as a pewter plate full of olives, and several goblets. The surface of the table seems tilted in an old-fashioned way so as to allow an unobstructed view of the various luxury objects which have been depicted with hard precision and without atmospheric density.We are looking at the last or penultimate course of an eight to nine-course banquet. The knife in the foreground, still largely the only piece of cutlery at the time, was shared by all the participant of the feast. The dragonfly and the butterfly add an emblematic dimension to this everyday motif. The artist shows the forces of good and evil fighting for man's soul in the form of animals. The human soul is represented by strawberries and cherries, which were considered to be fruits of Paradise. The butterfly, as a symbol of salvation and resurrection, is in opposition to the dragonfly which was seen as a subspecies of the common fly. Flies were considered to be creatures of the devil

21309-11repent.jpg	The repentant (penitent) Magdalen was a theme of particular importance for Georges de La Tour. He is known to have painted four full-length versions of the subject which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; in the Mus�e du Louvre, Paris; in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles; and in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. Moreover, there are several copies as well as a contemporary engraving.All of La Tour's Magdalens run counter to the type favoured by most of his contemporaries, who preferred to portray a voluptuous and scantily clothed Magdalen in a cave or grotto, eyes heavenward, curly blond hair flowing over her shoulders. By contrast, La Tour's Magdalens appear in profile with dark, straight hair, seated at a table in an austere interior

04805-cremona3.jpg	The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht D�rer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy D�rer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.The broad atmospheric landscape of the Annunciation to Joachim emulates Giorgione's inventions.

15106-nativity.jpg	This picture is attributed to Geertgen by analogy with works given to him in seventeenth-century sources. It may derive from a lost altarpiece; at this period large-scale compositions were frequently adapted for domestic devotions.The subject of this magical little panel is vision: first, the mystic vision recounted by a fourteenth-century saint, Bridget of Sweden, in which she witnessed the painless birth of Christ, the Virgin's adoration of her son, and the baby's radiance eclipsing Joseph's candle; secondly, the ocular vision of dazzled shepherds shielding their eyes as the angel appears, like a shooting star, to announce the birth of the Messiah; thirdly, the marvelling gaze of childlike angels, ox and ass, Mary and St Joseph upon the Light of the World naked in the manger. And, finally, it makes evident a new vision of piety current in the Northern Netherlands, in which humility is the key to holiness, and a new artistic vision.The divine radiance is not embodied in costly expanses of gold and rare pigments crafted into a precious object. It is made visible to us through Geertgen's patient modulation of darkness, the winter's night barely pierced by distant stars, hardly warmed by fire, only faintly lit by the candle Joseph once held (probably lost when the panel was trimmed at some time in the past). Through Geertgen's mastery of naturalistic description, with only a shorthand notation of thin rays of real gold beaming from the holy infant, this winter's night as it was before the birth of Christ can now be seen to have truly been, as is written in the Gospel of St John, a night in which 'if a man walk ... he stumbleth, because there is no light in him' (11:10).

26024-13john1.jpg	The left wing features the Beheading of St John the Baptist.The scenes in the triptych dealing with St John the Baptist are the following (in chronological order).The first capital above the Baptist's head (central panel) represents the announcement of his birth to Zacharias. The birth itself is shown in the second capital. His life story commences in the far left background of the central panel, before meandering across the left wing and back into the middle. The evangelical episodes comprise a synthesis of all four Gospels, although some derive solely from the Gospel of St John. From rear to front in the central panel, we see St John the Baptist praying in the wilderness (the forest) and the Sermon. In the left wing, from left to right: St John the Baptist answering the questions of the priests and Levites, the Baptism of Christ and the Ecce Agnus Dei enacted before John's first two disciples on the opposite bank of the Jordan. The Arrest of St John the Baptist by Herod is once again portrayed in the central panel. John is led away to the left towards the prison tower in the left wing, opposite which Salome's dance takes place in an open chamber of the palace. Sculpted figures in niches above this scene, represent a naked man between two naked women. We are meant to understand these as pagan images, possibly alluding to Herod's immoral behaviour.The Beheading of St John the Baptist in the foreground takes place on the high, barren execution yard of the prison, which is reached by a staircase from the courtyard of the palace. The two disciples of John the Baptist, Andrew and St John the Apostle, are seen standing to the right of this courtyard. Behind and to the right of the figure of the Baptist in the central panel, his body is exhumed at the command of Emperor Julian the Apostate in Sebaste, and burned.

08524-4portra1.jpg	In April 1886, C�zanne married Hortense Fiquet in Aix. The reason why, after so long, he decided to make his relationship with Hortense official, despite not having loved her for a long time, was probable to ensure that their son Paul, now aged fourteen, did not suffer the stigma of having unmarried parents.Hortense did not share C�zanne's passion for painting and literature, and she preferred the bright lights of Paris to the solitude of the Proven�al countryside. But she seems to have possessed huge reserves of patience and posed for the artist in endless sittings. He painted over forty portraits of her, mostly showing her as a severe and reserved-looking woman with hard, angular features, such as the present painting

32052-stillife.jpg	"It can hardly be a coincidence that armour and weapons often occur in still-lifes painted during the Thirty Years' War. This war, which caused unimaginable suffering, was originally started by the Spanish-Austrian House of Habsburg together with the League of the Roman Catholic Estates of the Empire. They were committed to the Counter-Reformation and wanted to re-catholicize the rebellious Republic of the United Netherlands after it had become independent in 1609, and in particular to conquer the economic resources of this wealthy country. Subsequently, however, the war spread more an more widely, with the involvement of an increasing number of countries. Dragging on interminably, the final phase was marked by soldiers pillaging, looting and brutally exploiting the civilian population.This is the background of paintings like Poorter's still-life. Painted in 1636, it provides an emblematic, impressionist commentary on the war. In 1634 the Imperial troops had gained a victory at N�rdlingen, so that the situation changed in favour of the League. This may well explain the ""vanitas"" character of the painting, expressed in the skull and the sarcophagus behind the banner which divides the picture diagonally into two parts. Thus, the victories of the other side are made to seem bearable, as they are mere vanity in the face of eternity. The crown and sceptre on the sarcophagus are a clear reference to the Emperor's power"

17568-26portra.jpg	The sitter of this portrait was identified on the basis of a portrait medal by Christoph Weiditz. Francisco de los Cobos y Molina (c. 1477-1547) was the secretary of State and Comendador for the kingdom of Castile under the rule of the Emperor Charles I of Spain (later Emperor Charles V). He became wealthy in his work with the state and used some of his riches in fostering patronage and acquiring art. He was a confidant and adviser as secretary to Emperor Charles V, with whom he travelled to Bologna in 1530 for Charles's coronation by Pope Clement as Holy Roman Emperor and afterward to Germany and Flanders, between 1530 and 1532. It was probably on the trip to Flanders that de los Cobos met and engaged Gossart to paint his portrait.This portrait belongs to Gossart's last great works, the perfection of the execution shows him at the peak of his abilities.

38444-12szinye.jpg	"Similarly to the Impressionist painters, most notably Monet, Szinyei Merse, too, noticed that the contrast between the greens and the reds of the meadows interspersed with the bright red of poppies create a fantastically vibrating image in the eyes of the viewers. This theme enabled the painter to return, after the long years of silence, to the colour schemes dreamt up in his younger years. Of the pictures showing poppies - painted in 1895, 1896, 1900 and 1902 - the 1896 version entitled ""Poppies in the Field"" is the most interesting, alongside with is variation painted six years later, ""Poppies in the Field"".

19893-93portra.jpg	This portrait was executed in the workshop of Hans Holbein the Younger.At the court of Henry VIII at Whitehall Palace Holbein catered primarily to the sovereign's requests, but he also counted among his patrons and friends many courtiers who were eager to have their portraits made by the king's painter. Holbein began such portraits by capturing the likeness of the sitter on paper. While he had employed black and coloured chalks on unprimed paper during his first visit to England (1526-28), he worked up the drawings of his second stay in coloured chalks and pen and ink on pink primed paper that approximated the colour of flesh. His meticulous drawings were in turn used as cartoons - one-to-one scale images - to transfer the details of the sitter's features onto the prepared ground of a panel. Many of these drawings survived. The present portrait can be directly linked to such a drawing by Holbein himself, the painting was most likely produced by a workshop assistant.It is supposed that the twenty-eight years old sitter may be Sir Ralph Sadler (1507-1587), a diplomat and administrator. However, the identification as Sadler is only hypothetical

He was to display similar instincts on other occasions.This is, however, far from simply being a work of antiquarian interest.

13301-03tript1.jpg	The Crucifixion and the Last Judgment (also in the Metropolitan Museum) were the side wings of a triptych, the central panel of which is lost. The attribution to Jan van Eyck is debated.These two small pictures conjure up a veritable microcosm. Every detail is observed with equal interest - from the alpine landscape to the slender body of Christ and the emotions of the various figures. The raised lettering on the original frames forms quotations from Isaiah on the Crucifixion and from Revelations and Deuteronomy on the Last Judgment.

14915-2martin1.jpg	Gauguin and Charles Laval journeyed to Panama in April 1887 and stayed there for a few weeks before going to Martinique, where this landscape was produced. The view is of the bay of Saint-Pierre, with the volcanic Mount Pel�e in the background. He had painted very few pure landscapes since his Impressionist days and this is an unusual work in Gauguin's oeuvre. This suggests that he was conjuring up a vision of a tropical paradise unsullied by any human contact, and in search of which he was later to travel to Tahiti. The regular patterning of the brushstrokes which unify the picture surface and which contribute to a flattening effect, coupled with the absence of any aerial perspective and the saturated jewel-like colours, owe a great deal to the work of C�zanne, which continued to influence Gauguin at this time

34969-2mustai2.jpg	The best preserved Carolingian fresco cycle can be found in a remote valley in Graub�nden, in the monastery church of M�stair. The church is dedicated to St John the Baptist, and it is generally believed to have been founded by in about 790, and probably by Charlemagne. One can assume that the frescoes were painted soon after the completion of the monastery church. Located in the apses, the paintings remained undiscovered until 1896 and were finally completely uncovered by 1950. Parts of the frescoes had been painted over in the twelfth century by artists belonging to the School of Salzburg.The artists who executed the paintings did not belong to Charlemagne's court school. Extensive commissions were taken on by itinerant artists who came from Italy and were trained in Byzantine style. The Byzantine influence can be found not only in the shapes but also in the treatment of the pictorial narrative, that is the manner in which the individual scenes are emphasized by the articulation of the architectural elements around them.The picture shows the scene Flight into Egypt

03302-desco2.jpg	The custom of presenting expensive gift to a new mother on the occasion of giving birth was widespread among the upper middle classes in renaissance Tuscany. Commonly these gifts took the form of either a five-piece maiolica set (including a broth bowl and cover, drinking cup, saltcellar, and lid) or a painted 'desco da parto' (tray, both of which were luxury imitations of functional objects, intended for presentation and display only. The imagery adapted for these objects was invariably secular, generally literary or mythological in source, frequently aristocratic or courtly in content, sometimes emblematic or moralising in theme. Occasionally, as in this case or in that of a celebrated tray by Masaccio, the trays are painted reportage, with the birth scene itself figured on the recto, enacted in contemporary interior by figures in contemporary dress; they function as precious documents of the social habits of the age.The birth scene on the recto of this tray is a faithful copy of a drawing by Lorenzo Monaco representing the Birth and naming of St John the Baptist.

10489-mercury.jpg	The subject of this monumental, larger than life-sized canvas was taken from Homer's Iliad. It was painted in the 1710s as a pendant to the Hermes Bringing the Head of Argos to Hera (Palazzo Comunale, Bologna). The image of the young and classically handsome Greek shepherd is one of the eighteenth century's most sublime scholarly syntheses of ancient and modern figurative culture. It is the successful crossbreeding of two great masters of seventeenth century Bolognese art: Annibale Carracci and Guido Reni, in two masterpieces Creti had long admired. He took up the same spatial arrangement of the figures and the representation of Mercury in flight in the mythological scene Annibale frescoed at the gallery of the Palazzo Farnese in Rome at the turn of the seventeenth century; at the same time he drew on the frontal pose of Reni's Triumph of Samson, a heroic and brazen virile nude painted in the second decade of the seventeenth century.

37296-1agostin.jpg	After having spent several years in Assisi, Pisa and Orvieto, only occasionally returning to Siena for very brief periods during which he worked in the Palazzo Pubblico, Simone actually returned to Siena on a stable basis. It was during this second Sienese period that Simone painted some of his most famous paintings, such as the Blessed Agostino Novello Altarpiece, the celebrated fresco of Guidoriccio da Fogliano and the Annunciation now in the Uffizi.The story of the Blessed Agostino Novello is an example of that form of popular religious spirit that grew up in the towns of Tuscany in the late 13th century and the early 14th. The Church's official saints were considered too remote by the people and spiritually so different from the reality of the times that they could not entirely satisfy the religious fervour that developed in those years. The people felt that they needed more tangible examples of holiness, more closely connected to daily reality, rather like St Francis of Assisi had been. As a result, some of the better known citizens, whose charitable and religious deeds were known to all (and in may cases miracles were attributed to them), were canonized as saints or blessed.Agostino Novello was one of these figures. After a brilliant career both as a layman and as a cleric (he studied law at the University of Bologna and became personal councillor to King Manfred, the son of Ludwig II; when he joined the Augustinian Order he became Prior General), Agostino Novello then renounced community life and retired to the hermitage of San Leonardo al Lago, near Siena.After his death in 1309, the worship of this saintly man spread so fast that the monks of his Order tried to have him nominated patron saint of the city: through the veneration of a member of their Order, the Augustinians were sure to gain prestige and power. But Agostino was not made patron saint of Siena, despite the fact that he must indeed have been the object of great veneration to judge by the impressive funerary monument that was built for him.Now in the Pinacoteca in Siena, the painting hung originally in the church of Sant'Agostino, probably above the wooden sarcophagus in which the Blessed Agostino was buried; together with the altar consecrated to him, these two elements formed a burial monument. The dating of this altarpiece can only be approximated. We can only suppose that it was already finished and in place on the occasion of the celebrations in honour of the Blessed Agostino held in 1324 and for which the Commune of Siena allotted a huge sum of money.The iconography, at least for modern observers like us, is clear but not that simple to understand. The central area, framed by a multifoiled ogival arch, encloses the figure of Agostino, who is given a saint's halo even though he had not been canonized. The wooded landscape, the old hermits in the medallions and the scene of the conversation with the angel (an episode that does not appear in any of the biographies) are all references to the hermit's life he led at San Leonardo al Lago. On the other hand, the face of Agostino, portrayed still as a young man, the red book he carries (perhaps the Constitutiones of the Order, which he had drawn up himself), as well as the fact that the miracles are all taking place in a very realistically described Siena, all suggest Agostino's political commitments and the pastoral duties he performed in the city.The miraculous powers of the Blessed Agostino are fully displayed in the scenes depicted at the sides of the central area; they are framed by trefoiled round arches and illustrate four miracles. The idea of Agostino's holiness, stressed by the sudden appearances of winged angels, was intended to capture the mediaeval public's religious sensitivity: the victims of the terrible accidents are for the most part children

33032-08ezekie.jpg	This painting is a typical example how some elements deriving from Michelangelo are present in Raphael's works from the period after 1517. The origin of the subject is the Bible. But instead of describing the four Cherubim (inspired by Babylonian iconography) as the Prophet did, Raphael represents a classical divinity with the traditional symbols of the Evangelists. A centrally placed tree dominates the low, broad landscape and the sky is stormy and turbulent. The divine group hovers amid the clouds, surrounded by an aura of bright light. The angel, eagle, lion and ox which symbolize the Evangelists, together with two cherubs, spiral around the vigorous central figure.The balance of this composition impressed Vasari. Ezekiel is so small he can scarcely be recognized in the bottom left of the background, the scenes being completely dominated by his vision.The painting, now in the Pitti Gallery in Florence, is believed to have been painted in 1518. Like many other paintings by Raphael, it was removed to Paris by Napoleon's army and returned to Tuscany in 1815

15370-crucifix.jpg	The irregularly shaped panel was originally the central pinnacle of an altarpiece. It shows a highly emotional representation of Christ's suffering on the cross, with the cross extending the full height of the composition at its centre. At the base and to the left, the fainting Virgin Mary is supported by one of the Holy Women and St John, while Mary Magdalen grieves, clutching the bloodstained cross. To the right of the cross are various bearded men who introduce the beholder to the tragic scene. Angels hover around the Saviour on the cross, either lamenting Christ's death or collecting his precious blood. Six larger angels framed separately at the sides originate from a different altarpiece, probably painted by Jacopo di Cione, and were added to the Crucifixion by a nineteenth-century collector.Several other panels of the original altarpiece, probably a triptych, were also identified in various collections

32263-15pansyr.jpg	Pan (Lat. Faunus) is the Greek god of woods and fields, flocks and herds. In Renaissance allegory he personifies Lust; he charmed the nymphs with the music of his pipes, and was said to have lain with all the Maenads. His home was Arcadia, which stood not merely for the region of the Pelloponese where he was originally worshipped, but also for the romantic paradise of the pastoral poets and artists like Poussin. This realm is inhabited by nymphs and shepherds, by satyrs, maenads, Silenus, Priapus and the centaurs who, with Pan, formed the retinue of Bacchus. It was from the latter that Pan acquired his goat's legs.The story of Pan and Syrinx is told by Ovid (Met. 1:689-713). Pan was pursuing a nymph of Arcadia named Syrinx when they reached the river Ladon which blocked her escape. To avoid the god's clutches she prayed to be transformed, and Pan unexpectedly found himself holding an armful of tall reeds. The sound of the wind blowing through them so pleased him that he cut some and made a set of pipes which are named after the nymph.Poussin chooses the moment in which Pan has almost caught the fleeing nymph: but movement becomes pose, time stands still, and Syrinx escapes through her transformation. Despite the terpsichorean harmony of the two, their contrary desires are convincingly written into their figures: the joyous yearning and onwards urge of Pan, and Syrinx's timid wish to preserve herself. The sensual vitality of the shepherd-god and the chaste beauty of the nymph are also clearly characterised by the artist's choice of colours: Pan, a reddish brown, and Syrinx pale in colour.Flying above the pair is Cupid as a winged boy holding a torch and a lead-tipped arrow, which he is about to cast at Syrinx. Ovid tells us that Cupid had various arrow-tips: a golden tip awakened love, while that of lead had the opposite effect.The dramatic events of the pursuit and the transformation take place within a landscape suffused with light; a light which, with its delicate, atmospheric sfumato, would have been more fitting for an idyll than this dramatic scene. The putti at the bottom of the picture cast themselves aside in fright. The tree trunk on the far right has been painted over Pan's hoof. Evidently Poussin added the tree at a later stage, to produce greater articulation in the picture's spatial structure.The river-god Ladon checks the two central protagonists, allowing the picture's suspense and dynamism to culminate at its centre. His face, reminiscent of that of the Antique sculpture of Laocoon in his death throes, seems to bear the ineluctable suffering of Antique tragedies, with a depth and emotion that goes beyond all human contingency. From the moment of its discovery in 1506 in Rome, the Hellenistic sculpture of the Trojan priest and his sons entwined by serpents awoke the especial interest of artists, for it showed a restrained formulation of agonising death that was valid for all time

42421-musicalp.jpg	In the centre of the painting an elegantly dressed group of two men and a woman make music. The man on the right plays the violin and looks at the woman who is beating time. She and the man next to her are singing from a score. To the right of the group is a table laid with plates, a knife, a glass, a silver jug, and, in the centre, a decorated meat pie. Behind the table a boy waves a glass at the central group while a maid looks on. In the left corner, cast in shadow, a man stands casually leaning on a chair and smoking a pipe. The scene is set in a simple interior with a stone floor and plain, light gray walls.Until about 1895, this painting was attributed to Anthonie Palamedesz due to a false signature. This is not surprising since the subject matter, the grouping and attire of the figures, and the relatively sparse interior of Palamedesz's early works seem comparable to those in Van Velsen's works. Moreover, comparisons may be drawn with the elegant companies by Dirck Hals in Haarlem, Pieter Codde and Willem Duyster in Amsterdam, and Jacob Duck and Gerrit van Honthorst in Utrecht.

00969-09crucif.jpg	This painting was originally the central panel of a triptych. The arms of the cross stretch right across the panel, as if intended to strengthen its frame. The upper limb takes the form of a flourishing tree, a possible reference to the popular Legend of the True Cross which claimed that the wood used for the crucifixion came originally from the tree of Jesse. In the branches of the tree sits a pelican in its piety, plucking its breast so that blood flows to feed its young, a common symbol of Christ giving of himself for the redemption of the world.Cardinal Juan de Torquemada, a noted Dominican, kneels before the cross, his red cardinal's hat on the ground before him next to the rivulets of blood. On either side of the cross stand the Virgin and St John. The cross is in no landscape or other spatial setting. There is only an abstract gold ground behind. At the foot of the cross is a skull representing Golgotha. Its Spartan design and intense, but quietly expressed, feeling make this a powerful image reminiscent of some of Angelico's earlier frescoes in the convent of San Marco.

19754-traveler.jpg	A friend and pupil of Jacob van Ruisdael, Hobbema and his teacher often made sketching trips together into the countryside near Amsterdam, later using their drawings as studies for paintings.

39177-12valmar.jpg	The picture shows a view of the Camera Cinese (Chinese Room), the last room in the suite in the Foresteria of the Villa Valmarana.The decoration of this room makes use of the repertoire of chinoiserie, so popular in the eighteenth century, which was disseminated not only in the intricate patterns of silks, porcelains, and furniture, but also on wallpapers. and which was employed in courtly room decor in the form of large-format wall pictures.The principal scenes are the Mandarin's Walk, the Offering of Fruits to Moon Goddess, and the Textile Merchant. They constitute a splendid example of the painter's imagination, which is revealed in his ability to describe, with surprising realism the events of the East known to him only through a few elements he might have become familiar with in Venice and in W�rzburg, and from prints that were in circulation in Venice. The smaller scenes are of equal value, including those above the doors, one depicting A Pair of Exotic Birds, the other A Cassowary Holding a Snake in Its Beak

05304-21left.jpg	The left wing of the triptych represents the Flight and Failure of St Anthony.As we learn from medieval compendia of saints' lives, St Anthony passed most of his long life (c. 251 -356) in the Egyptian desert, where his extraordinary piety made him an object of special attention for Satan. Once while praying in the shelter of an old tomb, Anthony was overwhelmed by a horde of devils who beat him so relentlessly that he was left for dead. After several fellow hermits had rescued and revived him, however, he returned to the tomb, where the devils caught him a second time and tossed him high into the air. This time his torments ended only when a Divine light illuminated the tomb and dispersed the devils. Satan then appeared in the guise of a beautiful and saintly queen whom Anthony encountered bathing in a river. Taking the hermit into her city, the Devil-Queen showed him all her supposed works of charity, and it was only when she sought to seduce the bedazzled Anthony that he recognized her true nature and intentions.Two of these episodes are represented on the left inner wing of the Lisbon altarpiece. In the foreground, the unconscious Anthony is carried across a bridge by two companions dressed in the habit of the Antonite Order, accompanied by a secular figure who has been identified with some plausibility as a self-portrait of Bosch. Anthony appears again in the sky, borne aloft by demons, while other monsters buzz around him like angry insects. These scenes conform fairly closely to the written sources but as in so many other instances, Bosch enriched the original accounts with a wealth of inventive and dramatic detail. Three monsters confer beneath the bridge as an equally grotesque messenger skates towards them on the ice. A bird gulps down its newly hatched young at lower left. On the road ahead of Anthony and his companions, another group of demons approach a kneeling male figure whose body forms the roof and entrance of a brothel; a false beacon lures ships to their destruction in the sea beyond; and the shore is littered with corpses

10992-301david.jpg	"This painting can be regarded as David's finest work, in which he has perfectly succeeded in immortalizing a contemporary political event as an image of social ideals. David's painting of Marat represents the peak of his involvement in the Revolution where invention, style, fervent belief and devotion combine to produce one of the most perfect examples of political painting. David presented the painting to the Convention on 14 November 1793.Jean-Paul Marat saw himself as a friend of the people, he was a doctor of medicine and a physicist, and above all he was editor of the news-sheet Ami du peuple. He suffered from a skin disease and had to perform his business for the revolution in a soothing bath. This is where David shows him, in the moment after the pernicious murder by Charlotte Corday, a supporter of the aristocracy. David had seen his fellow party member and friend the day before. Under the impact of their personal friendship David created his painting ""as if in a trance,"" as one of his pupils later reported.David takes the viewer into Marat's private room, making him the witness of the moments immediately after the murder. Marat's head and arm have sunk down, but the dead hand still holds pen and paper. This snapshot of exactly the minute between the last breath and death in the bathroom had an immense impact at the time, and it still has the same effect today.David has used a dark, immeasurable background to intensify the significance. The boldness of the high half of the room above the figure concentrates attention on the lowered head, and makes us all the more aware of the vacuum that has been created. The distribution of light here has been reversed from the usual practice, with dark above light. This is not only one of the most moving paintings of the time, but David has also created a secularised image of martyrdom. The painting has often, and rightly, been compared with Michelangelo's Piet&#224; in Rome; in both the most striking element is the arm hanging down lifeless. Thus David has unobtrusively taken over the central image of martyrdom in Christianity to his image of Marat. Revolutionary and anti-religious as the painting of this period claimed to be, it is evident here that it very often had recourse to the iconography and pictorial vocabulary of the religious art of the past"

10617-cows.jpg	Cuyp was not only a landscape painter, although there is no doubt that his most attractive and significant works belong to this genre. His range covered conversation pieces, seascapes, portraits and group portraits, but he most frequently depicted animals and landscapes with human figures engaged in fishing, hunting or riding. The setting is generally the countryside around his native town of Dordrecht, and his pictures show us the Meuse estuary with its low coastline, boats at their moorings and cattle grazing. The pictures are characterized by an atmosphere of serenity and calm, with glistening water, soft clouds, gentle landscape, cattle whose smooth coats shine in the evening light and human figures engrossed in work, all combining in a peaceful harmony.In the present painting Cuyp portrays several cows quenching their thirst and cooling down in the shallow water. Although the surface of the water is still smooth, the billowing clouds above signal a change in the weather suggestive of the end of a warm day. The scene unfolds along a very low horizon that gives rise to a vast sky. Cuyp's pleasing disposition of the animals also serves to convey their great bovine tranquillity and calm

39761-09isabel.jpg	"In his Isabella d'Este, Titian combines the category of the anonymous beauty with that of the portrait. By 1536, when she saw it finished, Isabella, one of the most admired and sophisticated women of the Renaissance, was a lot older than she looks here, and Titian was specifically asked to make use of a portrait by Francia as a guide to her earlier appearance. He was clearly never expected to produce anything close to a likeness, but to render a flattering evocation of her appearance when young. Famed for her elegance, she wears a turban of her own design. Whatever the limitations of such a likeness, Titian manages to endow her with a feisty personality that evokes her wide-ranging abilities and imperious manner.Isabella commented that Titian's portrait was ""so pleasing that I doubt that at the age I am represented I could have possessed all the beauty it contains."

39634-5presen.jpg	Titian painted this picture for the Scuola Grande of Santa Maria della Carit&#224;, now the Accademia Gallery of Venice. The painting is remarkable for its glowing colours and for the careful depiction of naturalistic detail. The architectural vistas, inspired by stage-sets for the theatre, play a fundamental role in the work. It is evident from this use of perspective and from other stylistic clues that Titian was receptive to the influence of Tuscan-Roman painting.The painting which occupies the whole of the entrance wall seems to be a 16th century version of the narrative works of Vittore Carpaccio. The painting is composed with a scenographic figural rhythm; on the right at the top of the stairs the priest and his assistants await the tiny figure of Mary who appears even smaller in her halo of holy light against the ponderous architectural background. On the left stands the throng of onlookers most of them outlined against the mountainous background, traditionally supposed to the that of the Marmarole in Cadore. The grandeur of the composition may appear studied and even academic but the painting of the elements which compose it is remarkable for the brilliant richness of the colour and interplay of tone. And amongst the host of individual portraits, each one drawn with a clear and immediate objectivity, we note in particular the four men dressed in togas. In their portrayal, full of monumental solemnity and individual energy, they are typical examples of Titian's value as portraitist of life in the 16th century. His objective observations are very different from the highly individual psychological investigations of Lorenzo Lotto.

There is no direct earlier precedent for this presentation of the heavenly hierarchies in different spatial spheres.

15132-aeneas.jpg	In 1511 Vittoria Piccolomini, niece to Pius III, married Borghese Petrucci, son of Pandolfo Petrucci, the ruler of Siena. This alliance was duly commemorated in one of the principal rooms in the Palazzo Petrucci in Siena. (The Petrucci coat-of-arms quartered with that of the Piccolomini appear on many of the pavement tiles and in three places on the surviving woodwork from this room.) Located in a medieval tower, the base of which became the principal entrance of the building, early sixteenth-century references to this third-floor room suggest that it originally functioned as an audience chamber where Pandolfo received guests and conducted official business. Nothing of the sixteenth-century painted decoration remains in the room today but it is clear from two eighteenth-century descriptions that it was originally decorated with eight fresco paintings representing classical subject matter, five of which survive today (the Triumph of Chastity and the Coriolanus Persuaded by his Family to Spare Rome both by Luca Signorelli in the National Gallery, London; the Return of Ulysses by Pinturicchio in the National Gallery, London; Fabius Maximus Ransoming Prisoners from Hannibal and the Flight of Aeneas from Troy, both by Girolamo Genga in the Pinacoteca Nazionale in Siena) and three are lost (two by Luca Signorelli and one by Pinturicchio). While all the surviving paintings demonstrate both the complex nature of the imagery chosen and Pandolfo's taste for antiquity, each of the painters retained his distinctive style.Genga in his painting of the Flight of Aeneas from Troy shows Aeneas's wife, Creusa, in a loose robe that is not dissimilar to those worn by women in antiquity. Her central position and spectacular pose underline the drama of the event, as recounted in Virgil's Aeneid, whereby she became separated from her husband, father-in-law and young son. In his representation of this calamitous event, Genga took the opportunity to convey different atmospheric effects, such as the smoke-laden city of Troy in the background and the reflection of moonlight on the domed roof of a temple on the left

29655-garden.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.To develop his skills, De Nittis went to Paris in 1868, settled there and became established. In 1873, through Degas, he met the Impressionists, and had five pictures in their first group exhibition in 1874. He also had more conventional work in the Salon, but his brushwork, composition and technique were steadily coming into line with French Impressionist practice in paintings such as The Victoria Embankment, London or Breakfast in the Garden

His painting shows a helmsman who is under way with his ship in high seas. By the division of the picture space the painter stresses the dramatic nature of this voyage. The sail takes up the upper left-hand corner, the man at the helm the lower right. Taut ropes cross the crest of a high wave and in this way bring in an additional dynamic element.

13313-16rolin.jpg	The donator of this painting is Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of Burgundy and Brabant. He established the H�tel-Dieu hospital at Beaune where Rogier van der Weyden executed the famous Last Judgment.Nicolas Rolin, who commissioned this work, was a man with a forceful personality. Despite his humble background, he was highly intelligent and eventually rose to hold the highest offices of State. For over forty years he was Philip the Good's right-hand man, and one of the principal architects of the monarch's success. Van Eyck painted him when he was already in his sixties. His face, though marked by the heavy responsibilities he has had to bear, still fascinates the viewer with the sense of energy and will-power which it projects. Rolin is wearing a gold brocade jacket trimmed with mink. He kneels at prayer on the left of the composition. His gaze is pensive, looking as though he has just raised his eyes from his book of hours.On the right is the seated figure of the Virgin. Wrapped in a voluminous red robe, she is presenting the Infant Jesus to the chancellor while a hovering angel holds a magnificent crown above her head. The figures have been brought together in the loggia of an Italianate palace. The three arches through which the space opens out behind them seem rather large in relation to their immediate surroundings. They give first onto a small garden with lilies and roses symbolizing Mary's virtues. Slightly farther back are two small figures, one standing at an oblique angle to the viewer and the other with his back to us. Near them are two peacocks, symbols of immortality, but perhaps also of the pride to which such a powerful man as Chancellor Rolin might well succumb.The most surprising feature in this splendid picture is without doubt the townscape that stretches out beyond the loggia. The crenellated battlements indicate that the palace is in fact a fortress, built on the edge of an escarpment. Below, a broad meandering river with an island in its midst flows through the heart of a city. The humbler areas of the town lie to the left, behind Chancellor Rolin. On the right, behind the Virgin, are the wealthy quarters, with a profusion of buildings, dominated by an imposing Gothic church. Countless tiny figures are flocking towards this part of town, across the bridge and through the roads and squares. Meanwhile on the river, boats are arriving and putting into shore. It is as if all mankind, united by faith, were travelling in pilgrimage towards this city and its cathedral. In the distance, the horizon is closed off by snow-capped mountains under a pinky-yellow sky. In the opinion of Charles de Tolnay, this painting represents a comprehensive vision of the entire universe

07258-canal708.jpg	Canaletto made five paintings of Warwick Castle, more than he was to paint of any other English building. He was commissioned to depict the subject by its owner Francis Greville, Lord Brooke, who became Earl of Warwick in 1759. The dates of payments suggest that Canaletto journeyed at least twice to Warwick, in 1748-9 and 1752. This work, probably painted in London, seems to be related to the earlier visit.The building is viewed from Castle Meadow, with the Castle Mound at the left and at the right a view of the town. On the River Avon in the foreground is a Venetian-style pleasure boat: this apparently incongruous detail may be explained by the fact that Lord Brooke had visited Venice and is known to have owned a decorated boat

20335-vaseflow.jpg	Son of Justus, a decorator of apartments and gardens, Jan van Huysum was one of the most famous Dutch painters of floral still-lifes, establishing himself in a pictorial genre that was already popular and widespread, and taking it to a perfection and virtuosity which was at times even mechanical. However, whereas in French artists, whom the painter was inspired by, ability and technical complexity were also reflected in the sometimes excessive elaboration of the portrayal, van Huysum stayed within the sober Quattrocento Flemish-Dutch tradition, even though he used specialistic motifs of the seventeenth century (the dark background and the presence of rare species of flowers)

40178-tonneman.jpg	This small-scale double portrait of Jeronimus Tonneman and his son Jeronimus Jr. ranks with the best conversation pieces. It is a type of portrait which continues the tradition of portraying full-length figures, seen in little, in a familiar setting while posing informally or engaged in activities that allude to their status and interests. The tradition was initiated by Thomas de Keyser in the 1620s and was carnied on by other artists in their small family portraits (Frans Hals, Molenaer, Adriaen van Ostade, Terborch, de Hooch, Metsu, Emmanuel de Witte). The tradition was broken in about 1675 by the new vogue for courtly portraits and those with a classical flavour. Troost can be credited with resuscitating it in the 1720s, and by the following decade he was its unrivalled master in Holland.As in seventeenth-century Dutch portraits of this type, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the interior which serves as a setting for a conversation piece is imaginary or not. For example, the room in which Tonneman is seated near his son playing a fashionable slender flute looks like a plausible portrait of an interior in his Amsterdam home. It is not. He did not have a room in his home decorated with a statue of St Susanna modelled after a work by the Flemish classical sculptor Fran�ois Duquesnoy (he and members of his workshop were responsible for the splendid sculptures that decorate Amsterdam's new town hall) or large plaster reliefs of mythological and allegorical subjects.On the other hand, the parchment-bound volume of van Mander's Schilderboek that lies on the table doing double duty as a makeshift stand for the son's music and as a sign that we are in the company of people who know something about the arts, is most likely not an imaginary prop. It almost certainly belonged to Tonneman; no less than three copies of van Mander's volume were listed in a 1754 posthumous sale of his effects

09790-01view.jpg	The picture shows a view of the long south wall with scenes 6-10 of the St Cecilia cycle. Above the entrance on the west wall is the balcony which abuts the Bentivoglio family chapel in the adjacent church of San Giacomo Maggiore.St Cecilia is one of the most famous Roman saints, although she is purely legendary. She is meant to have lived in the second or more probably the third century, but only appears in the tradition in the fifth and sixth centuries. A young girl of noble background, she was betrothed, in spite  of her vow of chastity, to a noble Roman, Valerius. After the apparition of an angel in the marriage chamber, she converted the young man to Christianity and persuaded both him and his brother, Tibertius, to receive baptism. She then refused to make an offering to the pagan gods and was condemned to be suffocated in a boiler, but was saved by the descent of a refreshing cloud from the sky. She was then taken to be beheaded, but the executioner, even after three violent blows, could not detach her head. She lingered on, mutilated, for three days before expiring.The fresco cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia consists of ten scenes from the legend of Saints Cecilia and Valerian, located on the north (scenes 1-5) and south (scenes 6-10) walls of the Oratory, which is connected by a passageway to the church of San Domenico Maggiore. The cycle, resembling a continuous frieze, is very different from the sort of painting normally found in parish churches. It bears a greater resemblance to the suites of canvases produced for Venetian oratories and assembly rooms.The ten horizontal panels, each filled with life-size figures in the foreground, create the impression of a continuous pictorial narrative, one that is structured but not actually interrupted by the framing pilasters. The continuous background landscapes incorporate scenes from the legend of St Cecilia, a large part of which involves the conversions and martyrdoms of her husband Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. Also depicted are the Roman official Maximus, another convert, and Pope Urban I as the saints' protectors, who are soon afterward martyred themselves.The predominant character of the cycle completely reflects the styles of the two masters who set the tone for the Bolognese school in around 1500, namely Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia. They must be regarded as the ones who devised the St Cecilia cycle, which was ultimately realized by collaborators whose names can no longer be determined with the exception of two panels with the signature of Amico Aspertini. The fact that the first pictures on each wall are by Francia would indicate that he was the supervisor of the project.Three pairs of scenes were executed by Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and Amico Aspertini, respectively. The author of the two other pairs are not known, here we present the reproductions of these scenes among the works by Francesco Francia.  The scenes of the cycle are the following:Scene 1: Marriage of Cecilia and Valerian (Francesco Francia)Scene 2: Valerian with Pope Urban (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 3: Valerian is Baptized (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 4: Coronation of Cecilia and Valerian (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 5: Martyrdom of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 6: Burial of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 7: Cecilia Disputing with Almachius (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 8: Martyrdom of St Cecilia (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 9: Cecilia Gives away Her Possessions (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 10: Burial of St Cecilia (Francesco Francia

23186-23monaco.jpg	There are four panels in the Metropolitan Museum in New York representing Old Testament patriarchs, which are among the finest works of Lorenzo Monaco, who, at the time the panels were painted, was the leading master in Florence. The four patriarchs (Abraham, Noah, Moses, and David) are each portrayed seated on a cut stone bench or chest set on a fictive marble dais, which is alternately pink with a strip of green in the foreground (Noah and David) or green with a strip of violet in the foreground (Abraham and Moses).Moses, in a blue tunic bound high above the waist with a knotted sash and covered by a violet cloak lined with yellow, with a blue shawl wrapped around his shoulders, supports the tablets of the Ten Commandments, one on each knee.The function of these four paintings, possibly as flanking elements of an altarpiece, has been debated

07228-canal515.jpg	This picture is a supreme example of a distinct phase within Canaletto's production that lasted from the late 1730s until circa 1742, in which the warm sunshine so characteristic of his early maturity gives way to a cool, clear light, bringing with it a greater clarity and precision			
06294-fighting.jpg	Dutch realism was a matter not merely of imitative techniques but also of everyday themes: people and objects, houses and streets that might be found in the Republic. Comic paintings seem especially deliberate in their concern with thematic as well as pictorial realism. Like comedies, comic images in theory should depict people as they are, or even worse as they are. Painters fulfilled this requirement in paintings of down-to-earth, lowly themes, of peasants and burghers guzzling, drinking, laughing, dancing, and groping. In theme, these paintings recall comic texts and plays that linger on similar scenes and motifs rather than presenting a tight narrative.  A painting of boors fighting by Adriaen Brouwer may seem uncommonly lifelike, with its violent action, gruff faces, poorly dressed peasants or urban dissolutes, and dishevelled tavern interior.
