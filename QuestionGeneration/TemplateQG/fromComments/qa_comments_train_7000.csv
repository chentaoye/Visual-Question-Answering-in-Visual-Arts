07804-10thomas.jpg	The fact that in his more mature religious works Vittore Carpaccio sees Giovan Battista Cima as a close and reliable point of reference, because Cima was another artist who was unwilling to keep constantly up-to-date with the latest innovations in the art language, is noticeable also in altarpieces like the St Thomas in Glory between St Mark and St Louis of Toulouse, a panel painted in 1507 for the church of San Pietro Martire in Murano and now in the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart

17298-selfpo25.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 344, JH 1353.Van Gogh often used himself as a model for practicing figure painting. His Paris self-portraits serve as a useful record of his painterly experiments. In this self-portrait of winter 1887/88, there is no systematic use of a single, unifying method of paint application. He used scattered dots of colour in the background and an overall reduction of the size of the brushmarks. He employed a distinct kind of mark for each area of the canvas, and these diverse and almost graphic systems of marks are related to the object or texture being represented. In the treatment of the face and head, the brushstrokes are directional, following and thus describing the planes and shapes in order to convey the structure and volume of the head or the texture and growth pattern of the facial hair.The portrait informs us about van Gogh in Paris. The image he presents by portraying himself in smart suit and hat is of van Gogh as a man of the city. In Paris, he studied the dotted Pointillist technique, and learned to apply it in his own fashion

24804-1seilern.jpg	The Triptych is named after its present owner, the Count of Seilern. It is considered to be the earliest of the Master's works to have survived to the present day.The central panel represents the Entombment: the Virgin, Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus and another Mary are holding Christ's body spread out on its shroud above the tomb. The other figures in the scene function as so many allusions to different stages in the Passion cycle: St John, on whom the Virgin leans, refers us to the Lamentation; Mary Magdalene rubbing oil into Christ's feet is a reminder of his Anointment; the woman who is holding up a piece of material is probably St Veronica, and her presence alludes to Calvary; finally, the angels who are carrying the instruments of the Passion represent the Crucifixion.The left wing depicts a donor. Behind the figure stands the hill of Golgotha. The central cross between the two thieves has been left empty, with a ladder propped against it, to remind us of the Descent from the Cross. The right wing represents the Resurrection. The gold background of all three panels is decorated with a motif of vine branches and grapes, symbols of Christ, the true vine.The figures in the central panel are noticably larger than those on the wings. The viewer thus feels closer to the central scene than to those on either side. Otherwise, however, the treatment of space is entirely traditional. On the left wing, for instance, the landscape behind the donor is quite shallow, and the figures are not shown one behind the other, but are ranged vertically and all depicted on the same scale

26126-34prayer.jpg	This little painting is no larger than a postcard and, unlike most of Memling's portraits, has a rounded top. This shape only became customary by the end of the fifteenth and above all in the sixteenth century. It probably formed a diptych with a Virgin on the left-hand side. The hypothesis linking this work with the Man of Sorrows in Esztergom is difficult to bear out because of the difference in proportions. There is some similarity in type and treatment with the 1487 portrait of Benedetto Portinari. This work is unlikely to have been painted earlier, at any rate - a fact suggested also by the curved shape

00114-christ_a.jpg	In the 16th century Antwerp rose to the position of the most significant trade and banking centre in Europe. In the area around this town there was an extensive cottage industry for the processing of English cloth and the production of glassware, soap, sugar, and other goods. The changing conditions in agriculture were almost equally revolutionary. The population increase at the beginning of the 16th century meant a greater demand for food, which had to be satisfied buy an agricultural system that was now no longer catering merely to itself but also to the market.After years of inadequate supplies the increase in food production was experienced by the general public as a great improvement - so much so, in fact, that it virtually demanded some form of artistic expression. Celebrating this new wealth in an almost solemn manner, the Amsterdam-born painter Pieter Artsen, who lived in Antwerp in 1555-56, depicted market scenes as part of biblical illustrations. However, instead of following traditional conventions and playing only a minor part in these illustrations, these market scenes dominate the biblical motifs so much that the latter are literally pushed into the background.In this painting Christ and the Adulteress, the biblical event takes place at the back, on the left, while the foreground is dominated by a market scene with peasants offering clay pots, baskets laden with fruit, vegetables such as onions, carrots, cucumbers and cabbages, as well as eggs, loaves of bread and large jugs of milk. It is this foreground which attracts our attention. There is also a peculiar mixture of time levels: the biblical scenario (with people wearing the clothes of antiquity) and the contemporary market scene (with sixteenth-century peasants) are intricately interwoven, as is shown in the Roman soldiers storming past the market stall. The same feature can be found in numerous other paintings of Aertsen

37271-5saints2.jpg	The group of saints painted alongside the altar dedicated to St Elizabeth in the north transept of the Basilica is an expression of the political and religious feeling that bound the House of Anjou to Hungary and the Spirituals. Scholars have found plausible historical explanations for their presence and identified them. Proceeding from left to right, after Saints Francis, Louis of Toulouse and Elizabeth of Hungary, we find St Margaret: this figure had always been identified as St Clare, until a recent cleaning revealed a small cross, the symbol of St Margaret. Next to her is a young and very beautiful saint, who is probably Henry, Prince of Hungary (and not Louis IX of France, as had been suggested: how could he be a king without a crown?), the son of St Stephen, shown on the next wall with St Ladislaus and the Madonna and Child.The presence of all these members of the House of Anjou in the frescoes in Assisi is justified, in other words, by the close connection existing between the Order and the royal family, and it is quite suitable that they be placed here, in the chapel of Cardinal Gentile da Montefiore who was both a Franciscan and a good friend of the Anjou

21281-bethel.jpg	La Hire never went to Italy, and his style was formed in Paris under the Mannerist Georges Lallemant. All La Hire's leanings towards classical antiquity were therefore learned at second hand, particularly from the work of Nicolas Poussin. As early as 1630, however, a certain coldness was detectable in his art, probably derived from Vouet, who had recently returned from Rome. Almost all of La Hire's best pictures are of figures in classical landscapes. The Children of Bethel Mourned by their Mothers corresponds to a type already perfected by Poussin, namely a strong moral content with figures carefully arranged in an equally carefully balanced landscape or architectural setting. Even though La Hire's result was totally different from that of Poussin and it would never be possible to confuse the two, they fall into the same general category and would have appealed to the same type of patrons.

21496-borghese.jpg	This fresco in the Villa Borghese, housing the Galleria Borghese, decorates the ceiling of a large room, called Sala della Loggia. Originally the room was a loggia opening onto the park of the villa, hence its name.In the fresco Lanfranco created an imaginary entablature in perspective, supported by telamones alternating with lunettes containing personifications of the Rivers of the Earth. At the centre is set the scene of the gods gathered in council around Jupiter, which draws on the tradition of the great decorative cycles of Annibale Carracci and Correggio. Between 1779 and 1782 the fresco, left unfinished by Lanfranco and now seriously deteriorated, was restored and completed by Domenico Corvi (1721-1803)

32106-labrador.jpg	"In 1499, the Spaniard Vicente Yanez Pinzon had become the first European to set foot on Brazilian soil. A year later a Portuguese, Pedro Alvarez Cabral, landed on the coast of the enormous country and took possession of it for his king. Between 1580 and 1640, Brazil - and Portugal - belonged to the Spanish world empire. Yet as early as 1624, the Dutch succeeded in taking the city of Bahia, and in the following years and decades expanded their sphere of influence, especially along the coast.In the seventeenth century, the short-lived Dutch colony of Brazil initially experienced a remarkably objective depiction, at the hands of a team of observers trained in science, cartography drawing, and painting. The result was a unique visual report on the country and its inhabitants, flora and fauna. One of the artists involved was the landscapist Frans Post.The Home of a ""Labrador"" (sugar cane planter) in Brazil is one of the forty-two canvases that Louis XIV received in 1669 from Jean-Marie de Nassau who governed Dutch brazil from 1637 to 1644.

12575-1lucrezi.jpg	"This panel is mentioned in the inventory, dated 1598, of the Kunstkammer of Munich. The cloth around the hips was presumably expanded upward around 1600. The opinion that the Lucretia, all things considered, was ""D�rer's most unpopular work,"" is undoubtedly widely shared.Because of many discrepancies and discordances in the proportions and in the expression of the figure, Anzelewsky defines it as ""a parody rather than an exaltation of the classical feminine figure."" The theme takes its origin from a Roman story that narrates how Lucretia, the virtuous wife of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, is dishonoured by Sextus, son of Tarquinius the Superb. She then takes her own life out of shame.The Lucretia of D�rer's painting does not pierce her heart. The artist thus follows one tradition, spread by Italian painters like Francesco Francia and adopted before him by Lucas Cranach as well. But all these represented the woman in a three-quarter profile, and they never set her in her own bedroom. The blood spouting from the wound is rather slight and does not stain the bridal bed, which remains neat and clean and undisturbed. This certainly indicates that the insult suffered is only exterior and has not contaminated the intimate purity of the chaste matron. There is one markedly commonplace and bourgeois detail in the scene, which must create the sense of a heroic-pathetic atmosphere: the presence of a night vase under the bed. The brush strokes are extraordinarily fine; the colours used for the drapes and the fabrics are predominantly various shades of red, blue, and green. D�rer made use of drawings that go back to 1508 for this painting"

09616-danae.jpg	"Correggio's masterpiece, Dana&#235;, depicts one of the four stories in Ovid's Metamorphoses about the ""Loves of Jupiter"", commissioned in around 1531 by Federico II Gonzaga in Mantua as a present for Charles V (the other scenes are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna and the National Gallery, London). The scene is set in an interior draped with rich and suitably folded hangings, framing a window opening onto the landscape, as if to ""unveil"" the union. Dana&#235;, the daughter of Acrisius, King of Argos, and of Eurydice, had been shut up by her father in a tower with bronze doors, as it had been prophesied that she would gave birth to a son who would be the cause of Acrisius' own death. But Zeus visited her in the form of a shower of gold falling from a cloud, and from their union Perseus was born. The maiden is reclining on a bed of classical design ornamented with knobs. Nearby Eros, as an intercessor between Zeus and the maiden, and representing divine desire, helps her to hold the sheet, so as not to loose the seed. At their feet two cupids, one wingless and the other winged, and intended as a contrast between ""sacred love and profane love"", are busy engraving a tablet with an arrow. It is a perfectly handled and balanced scene, that, while reminiscent of Titian's paintings, is not free of influence of Giulio Romano.Correggio's painting maintains a purity of style that never descends to the vulgarly erotic. Thus it reveals itself to be almost a prelude to some of Canova's sculptures and to certain neoclassical solutions: that sheet, rumpled so as to resemble an unmade bed became a model for a great deal of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century painting.Dana&#235; is frequently represented in Renaissance and Baroque painting.You can view other depictions of Dana&#235; in the Web Gallery of Art"

21688-kostka.jpg	Le Gros' artistic makeup was such a successful synthesis of Italian and French elements that he never lacked work; his commissions, however, frequently embodied retardataire taste, none more so than the extraordinary multicolored St Stanislaus Kostka on his Deathbed. Here Le Gros'work looks back to the tradition of ecstatic or dying saints created by Bernini and Caffa, but instead of a white marble figure set off by coloured marbles, colour forms an integral part of Le Gros' work: black touchstone for the Jesuit habit, Sicilian jasper and yellow marble for the bedding, and gilt bronze for the fringe. The saints hands, feet and head are carved from white Carrara marble, with the hair left rough and unpolished and the nails and eyes delicately incised.The work's purpose was to shock visitors entering the room where the young man once lived, by conveying the impression of someone actually dying, and the Jesuits resisted Le Gros' attempts to have the sculpture moved from their novitiate to the church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale, largely because of its effectiveness in its intended setting

23749-stillife.jpg	The main preoccupation of the Neapolitan still-life painters of the second half of the seventeenth century was not to create a perfect and deceptive representation of textures and surfaces, which was the aim of the northern Italian  painters, or to an even greater extent, the Dutch masters of still-life. The Neapolitan artists focused on decorative effect expressed through pictorial composition. This intention is reflected in a virtuoso style of painting that seeks to be recognised and esteemed as such.In this painting Malinconico evokes the sensual delights exclusively through the application of paint and the use of colour. Materials and their imitation in paint did not really interest Neapolitan artists at the end of the seventeenth century. Colour as matter became the prime concern.

04081-nativity.jpg	The panel is signed in the lower left corner in monogram: GB. It is tentatively assumed that the artist is Willem (Guillaume) Benson, the son of the painter Ambrosius Benson. From the style it is apparent that the painter was active in Bruges during the mid-sixteenth century. The composition is derivative; stemming ultimately from the Nativity that forms the centre panel of the triptych attributed to Gerard David (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art), which can itself in general terms be related back to the Adoration of the Shepherds by Hugo van der Goes in Berlin (Staatliche Museen). David's composition was evidently much appreciated, since it is also echoed in works by many of his followers or associates: Ambrosius Benson (attributed to; Leningrad, Hermitage), Adriaen Isenbrant (Antwerp, Meyer van den Bergh Museum) and the Master of the Female Half-Lengths (Strasbourg, Mus�e des Beaux-Arts).

The carving in the shrine represents the titular saint while on the hinged shutters there are paintings depicting scenes from his life.The impact of Netherlandish painting is clearly evident in the detailed landscape background - feature unusual in earlier Hungarian panel painting - and also in some of the motifs adopted in Hungary from German art. The motif of the Mary Magdalen embracing the Cross, used by Eyck and Rogier, was transmitted to the Master of J�nosr�t through one of the engravings of Master E.S., while the figures of the Virgin and St. John on the left of the Cross and of the Captain on the right, bear witness to the influence and accurate imitation of Schongauer's engraving.

32781-22grand.jpg	The Madonna del Granduca (1504) in the Pitti Gallery in Florence shows the pre-eminent influence of Leonardo. Its simple composition is a prototype for the future Madonnas of Raphael's last Florentine period. The figures of the Virgin and Child emerge from a dark background (an element evidently derived from Leonardo), bound together by a sweet sentiment which derives largely from the gesture of the Child who, while looking toward the spectator, presses against his Mother The painting belonged to the 17th century Florentine painter, Carlo Dolci, and then to Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Lorraine from whom its name derives.In spite of the fact that this painting is in part changed by the drastic nineteenth century restoration which included the repainting of the background and of the dress, it has still remained one of the finest creations of Raphael in his early period, at the time, when having come to Florence after his first formation under Perugino, he became acquainted with Florentine art at the beginning of the Cinquecento; and as is clearly seen in this work, was especially impressed by the painting of Leonardo. In the Madonna del Granduca both the Peruginesque and the Leonardesque influences are fused and assimilated by the young artist into a marvellous harmony which extends to the whole composition, from the spacing of the two figures in the space with that sense of flowing rhythm to the magic of the colour which softly dissolves into delicate shadow.Raphael's greatest paintings seem so effortless that one does not usually connect them with the idea of hard and relentless work. To many he is simply the painter of sweet Madonnas which have become so well known as hardly to be appreciated as paintings any more. For Raphael's vision of the Holy Virgin has been adopted by subsequent generations in the same way as Michelangelo's conception of God the Father We see cheap reproductions of these works in humble dwellings, and we are apt to conclude that paintings with such a general appeal must surely be a little 'obvious'. In fact, their apparent simplicity is the fruit of deep thought, careful planning and immense artistic wisdom. A painting like Raphael's 'Madonna dell Granduca', is truly 'classical' in the sense that it has served countless generations as a standard of perfection in the same way as the works of Pheidias and Praxiteles. It needs no explanation. In this respect it is indeed 'obvious'. But, if we compare it with the countless representations of the same theme which preceded it, we feel that they have all been groping for the very simplicity that Raphael has attained. We can see what Raphael did owe to the calm beauty of Perugino's types, but what a difference there is between the rather empty regularity of the master and the fullness of life in the pupil! The way the Virgin's face is modeled and recedes into the shade, the way Raphael makes us feel the volume of the body wrapped in the freely flowing mantle, the firm and tender way in which she holds and supports the Christ Child - all this contributes to the effect of perfect poise. We feel that to change the group ever so slightly would upset the whole harmony. Yet there is nothing strained or sophisticated in the composition. It looks as if it could not be otherwise, and as if it had so existed from the beginning of time

33659-06misc.jpg	"Catalogue number: Bredius 30.This unique double portrait of Rembrandt and Saskia (c. 1635-36) seems to offer an ironic and reflective gaze at his life. Here, too, an etching echoes the subject of the painting, but in the 1636 etched double portrait Rembrandt shows himself at work, drawing as he looks up at the viewer. In the Dresden painting Saskia sits on the lap of a foppishly dressed Rembrandt, who gaily holds up a flagon of ale as he twists to offer a silly grin out of the picture. This tavern setting at once indulges a current ""Arcadian"" fashion for showing fashionable ladies as courtesans (yet another incarnation of the goddess Flora, with whom Rembrandt had already identified Saskia) as well as draws upon the pictorial tradition of the Prodigal Son with the tavern harlots. It is worth noting that the lavish dress of this couple offers an echo of the finery in the Kassel profile of Saskia, but here the suggestion of loose living and of future repentance from the Prodigal Son analogy also sounds a note of self-criticism"

39940-0view1.jpg	The frescoes above the gallery behind the crossing in the nave of the Upper Church show the unmistakable style of Jacopo Torriti who was chosen by Pope Nicholas IV for the mosaic decoration of the apsidal tribunes of San Giovanni Laterano (1291) and Santa Maria Maggiore (1296) in Rome. The frescoes in Assisi are earlier than the Roman mosaics, as is clear from their more old-fashioned approach to the representation of space.The decorative program in the nave consists of the fresco cycle Legend of St Francis painted by Giotto beneath the gallery on the lower part of the wall, and episodes from the Old Testament above the gallery in the clerestory on the north wall, and episodes from the New Testament on the south wall. Some of these scenes as well as the vault with the Deesis were painted by Torriti and his assistants.The picture shows the decoration on the north wall (to the right from the entrance)

11209-1890s_04.jpg	Around 1880 Degas's grays gave way to brilliant colours, ranging from red to russet, and muted tones were replaced by warm ones. This came with a change in style and technique, in which pastels became his dominant medium. Degas was the only nineteenth-century painter who made pastels his primary medium. He saw that pastels struck a balance between painting and drawing, enabling him to paint while drawing. Furthermore, he expanded the possibilities offered by pastels by combining them with gouache, watercolour, oils mixed freely with turpentine, and even monotypes.Degas's later paintings of dancers remove the figures completely from the realist atmosphere of the stage. The luminous tracery of colours now reigns supreme. The dancers become the essence of rhythmic movement, pure emanations of colours

35636-04sketch.jpg	On 12 November 1619 a contract was drawn up between Johannes del Rio, dean of the Onze-Lieve Vrouwekerk in Antwerp, and Peter Paul Rubens. The painter undertook to paint 'a panel depicting the story of the Assumption of Our Lady' for a fee of 1500 guilders. He received the first 1000 guilders in September 1626, and the remaining 500 guilders followed in March 1627.The reason for the long delay between the conclusion of the contract and the execution of the commission was that the altar where the painting was to be placed was not completed until 1626. The dimensions involved were gigantic: the altar is 14 metres high and more than 7 metres wide.Rubens's altarpiece measures 4,9 by 3,25 metres. As a first step towards the making of this monumental composition, Rubens painted the 'modello' discussed here, which may be dated on stylistic grounds in the early 1620s. This preliminary study was intended to give the client an idea of what the composition would look like, so that he could comment on it at an early stage.Preliminary studies of this kind by Rubens are best characterised as ideas expressed in paint. The rapid execution this implies is also clearly visible in the technique: the paint has been applied off the cuff in rapid movements of the brush. The upward movements give the image a highly dynamic quality. Although Rubens often enlisted assistants to help him with major commissions, it is clear from the high quality of this 'modello' and the altarpiece in the OnzeLieve-Vrouwekerk that he executed this important commission all by himself

32978-01castig.jpg	"The Portrait of Baldassarre Castiglione, a literary figure active at the court of Urbino in the early years of the 16th century, may or may not have been painted by Raphael. According to a letter of 1516 from Pietro Bembo to Cardinal Bibbiena, ""The Portrait of M. Baldassar Castiglione... [and that of Duke Guidobaldo di Montefeltro] would seem to be by the hand of one of Raphael's pupils"". But the high quality and masterful combination of pictorial elements which distinguish the painting (note the affection inherent in the intelligent and calm face of Castiglione) lead one to believe that the master participated in some way in its execution. Certainly the shaded tonalities of the clothing and the unusually light background indicate the hand of a skillful and experienced painter.Baldassare Castiglione, a humanist and a writer, was one of the most important men of the Italian Renaissance. His popular book  ""Il cortegiano"" (The Courtier) summed up the tastes and culture of the Renaissance, it gives insights into the thinking and culture at the court of Urbino at the turn of the 16th century, and is written in a style that is delightfully clear and precise.

Initially rejecting her demands, he eventually honours her request so he will not be worn out by her persistence.In the present painting Pieter de Grebber has selected the moment after the judge has given in to the demands of the woman.

10906-cambyse1.jpg	David's first paintings probably date from the years between 1480 and 1484. They reflect a Dutch influence in his early training. Soon after he arrived in Bruges, however, in 1487 and 1488, the municipal authorities requested him to paint a series of panels for the deputy burgomaster's room in the town hall. This major commission took the form of a large diptych that was first mentioned in the city archives as a Last Judgment, but which in fact depicts The Judgment of Cambyses. The subject is taken from Herodotus: the judge Sisamnes, who had been guilty of prevarication, was arrested and punished by Cambyses, the King of Persia. For his crimes, Sisamnes was condemned to be flayed alive. David represents this scene with a cold and exemplary cruelty. Like the paintings Dieric Bouts made for the town hall in Louvain, David's panels were intended as a stern warning to judges against the temptation of corruption.The left panel depicts: The Corrupt Judge Arrested

32858-parnas.jpg	"The third composition for the Stanza della Segnatura represents Parnassus, the dwelling place of Apollo and the Muses and the home of poetry, according to classical myth.Mount Parnassus, the home of Apollo, is, like the hill of the Vatican, a place where in ancient times there was a shrine to Apollo dedicated to the arts. This has a direct bearing on the picture because through the window on the wall where the fresco is painted there is a view of the Cortile del Belvedere and the hill of the Vatican. There were newly discovered classical sculptures in the Cortile, such as the Ariadne that Raphael used as a model for the muse to the left of Apollo.Apollo plays a lira da braccio (an anachronism which, according to some, was meant to symbolize the perpetual value of the poetic message). He sits under a laurel grove with the nine Muses (who personify the nine types of art). The most eminent classical and contemporary poets are depicted together in a harmonic ascending and descending movement from left to right. Homer is flanked by Virgil and Dante, Ovid and Horace are next to Sappho, while from the ""ranks"" of moderns we can identify Petrarch, Boccaccio and Ariosto. Petrarch is recognizable in the group in the left foreground; so is Sappho, who holds a scroll bearing her name; Ennius is seated above them, listening to the song of the blind Homer (who appears as a protagonist, like Apollo), behind him stands Dante, who had also appeared in the Disputa as a theologist, evidently because of the doctrinal content of the Divine Comedy. Some see the portrait of Michelangelo in the bearded figure immediately to the right of the central group, although it is more readily identified with Tebaldeo or Castiglione, for the scene is, after all, a celebration of poetry.Raphael in several sketches significantly changed some of the details, including the musical instruments used. In the early versions Apollo played on a traditional stylized classical lyre, but this fresco shows him playing a Renaissance lira da braccio with a bow. The bow was unknown in Antiquity, although later they attributed its invention to Sappho. It has nine, instead of seven, strings to match the number of Muses; this, in Raphael's conception, signifies timelessness, just as the fact that the classical and contemporary poets are depicted together.While working on this fresco, the artist may have become acquainted with that ancient sarcophagus from Asia Minor which is adorned with the relief sculpture of the nine Muses. This was his source for the three additional instruments shown in this fresco: Erato's kithara, to the right of Apollo, the Lydian aulos of Eutherpe, on the other side, and below, the strange, tortoise-shell lyre of Sappho - all of which he rendered striving for archeological accuracy.In this fresco, music fills the role of moving force behind the Apollonian universe, at the same time being the symbol of poetry.Compositional harmony and visual counterpoint characterize the fresco: the groups of figures are bound together by continuous lines and the single characters are represented in opposed but corresponding poses. Although the Parnassus lacks the high originality of the School of Athens, it demonstrates Raphael's illustrative ability. It is enriched by classical elements which must have held great appeal for a cultural class excited by the recent archaeological discoveries. Thus we must add Raphael's capacity to interpret contemporary taste to his genuine artistic skills"

17004-nuenen19.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 161, JH 788.In December 1884 van Gogh set himself the task of painting and drawing a large series of portraits of the peasants in Brabant. In this group of works he did not want to portray individuals but sought to characterize a type: the peasant. Rather than seeking beauty, he was looking for models that had rough, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips.The present painting shows a female model wearing a black garment that was traditionally worn when there was a death in the family. It was a long piece of fabric folded double and placed over the cap on the head. The creation of this painting is perhaps related to the death of van Gogh's father: he died unexpectedly on March 26, 1885

26567-04_3ce4.jpg	The sixth scene in the chronological order of the narrative, The Fall and Expulsion from Garden of Eden, is depicted in the large field of the vault of the second bay, between the triangular spandrels.A bold and momentous step towards greater clarity was taken with the Fall of Adam and the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. It has been noted that the composition's three pilasters, the fallen pair to the left, the pair expelled from Paradise to the right, and the anthropomorphized tree of knowledge with the female tempter in the centre (the Tree of Life before the Fall), join arms at the top to form the letter M in uncial script. Was this intended to be Michelangelo's signature? To the left, the profusion of the Garden of Eden is indicated by a few details, but even among these a barren stump thrusts up its branches beside the archetypal female. To the right, total desolation surrounds the human couple.The rhythm of the whole composition flows from left to right. Eve grasps the apple boldly, Adam greedily, but in misfortune he seems greater than the woman. He knows that through his fall God, who was near to him, has become inaccessible and remote. He almost disdains the garden of which he feels no longer worthy. In spite of rocks and the barren tree stump, Eden - the term signifies bliss - is too voluptuous and full of delight; the bodies are too plump and smooth, the foliage above their heads is almost too luxuriant. It is as though Michelangelo meant to say: 'This is not yet the truth; that will have to be won in the desert of our destiny.' It is, moreover, striking that the cherub with the raised sword pointing the way out, although in flight and strongly foreshortened, appears a twin of the tempter and, like her, issues from the tree (the Tree of Life; the Cabalistic Sephiroth). Good and Evil have divided and become a dual power. This idea, like nearly every fresco on the vault of the Sistine, is full of mysteries which, we now realize, have their parallels in artistic and structural mysteries. Everything connects in Michelangelo's designs. In spite of their intellectual content, in spite of his humbly self taught knowledge, he never became literary; nor did he think in logical categories or in terms of dialectic, but visually and in symbols

His interpretation of a bridge over the Rh�ne canal south of Arles took on the familiar idyllic quality of genre scenes. Two of the versions (F 397 and F 571) are only very slightly different. Van Gogh had climbed down the canal bank to watch the washerwomen at their work beside a wrecked barge. He saw their figures in the familiar stooped postures we remember from his digging women in the Dutch paintings. For the third version (F 570) van Gogh has taken up his position on the opposite bank.

00065-ark.jpg	Luigi Ademollo, an Italian painter, draftsman, and engraver, was the uncle of the painter Carlo Ademollo (1825-1911). The Tuscan activities of this Lombard painter contributed to the establishing of modern Nea-Classical aesthetics in Florence. His decorative scenographic paintings on subjects drawn from mythology and Greek and Roman history, rich in grandiloquent archeologisms. certainly produced responses from local artists. Two representative examples of Ademollo's style and language are the painting decoration of the Palatine Chapel (1791-92) and of the later (1816) Sala dell'Arca (Room of the Ark) in the Pitti palace.Ademollo decorated the Room of the Ark with biblical scenes inspired by the history surrounding the Holy Ark of the Jewish people. Before the backdrop of classical architecture, a multitude of people are moving in a frieze-like procession with the Holy Ark being carried under the leadership of the high priest. The scenes are rich in narrative detail and reveal the artist's ability for elaborate historical recreations

03815-098ecsta.jpg	Giovanni Bellini responded positively to Flemish realism and the new luminous capacities of the oil medium. In this panel St Francis stands in the midst of a landscape which is replete with the complex symbolic allusions of Flemish art - plants, animals, and household objects alluding to Franciscan ideals of poverty and humility. Resembling a stigmatisation, this scene may be, rather, a meditation on Francis identification with creation. It is dawn, the rocks a cool grey-green, except where the first rays of the sun begin to warmth the earth. Francis stretches out his arms and looks skyward, where, in traditional Franciscan stigmatisations, one would expect to find a seraph. Natural beauty and light are sufficient to describe the divine.

34351-crossing.jpg	"In his picture, Richter attempts to catch the simple, moving tone of a folksong, in order to lend resonance to the venerable idea of a ""ship of life"" in which all ages of man, from infancy to old age, are united, The young vagabond gazing up towards the castle ruins becomes a personification of Romantic yearning - depicted from behind to encourage us as viewers to identify with him - while the old singer invokes bygone times. The boat itself appears much too small to carry the people crowded into it, and seems immobilized in the middle of the river. The arch overspanning the composition is probably intended to give it a solemn, sacramental air.This painting was enthusiastically received by Richter's contemporaries, and is still one of his best-known pictures in Germany today"

32503-virgin_c.jpg	Procaccini, although relatively little-known outside Italy, was one of the most successful and prolific painters of the early years of the seventeenth century. He was born into an artistic family in Bologna, which moved to Milan in the mid-1580s. His earliest works were statues commissioned for churches in Milan and Cremona, but in about 1600 he turned to painting. He worked across much of northern Italy, finding employment in Modena, Cremona, Pavia and Genoa, where he assimilated a broad range of styles.This lyrical, small-scale devotional picture would have been intended as an aid to prayer and contemplation: it shows the infant Saint John holding up a lamb before the Holy Family, representing Christ's future sacrifice. Its style reflects Procaccini's study of Parmigianino's works, and it is painted with a liquid freedom usually associated with preparatory sketches, although it is considered a resolved painting

Otherwise, he remained permanently in Seville, his native city, and his life was a simple one, free of serious problems. By 1645 his style had hardened in its final mold, as may be seen in the paintings executed about this time for the Franciscans, with the first of those figures of rascals and beggars in which he was to specialize. This is the spirit, for example, of the Boys Eating Melon, in Munich, and the Boy, in the Louvre, which is a study in yellowish ochers and browns

The coat of arms and inscriptions make it quite clear whose portrait this is. 'Dieu et mon droit' is the motto of the British royal family. This woodcut was made in Amsterdam, but published in Antwerp by Hans Liefrinck. The colouring was added with great care. This was probably Liefrinck's first issue of the series of royal portraits by Anthonisz.

24050-2sposi02.jpg	The three picture panels of the west wall are also conceived as imaginary views through a curtained loggia. The painted curtains have been drawn so far to the side that we can see a landscape beneath a blue sky dotted with clouds that extends across the entire width of the wall. This panorama, consisting of rolling hills and occasional bizarre outcropping of rock, is enlivened by thriving, well-fortified cities and country people hard at work in the fields. Adorning the countryside are stone walls, dwellings aqueducts, and marble statues. This glimpse of world filled with industry and prosperity is possibly an ideal picture of the marquisate of Mantua. Despite the various Roman monuments - the Pyramid of Cestius, the Colosseum, and so on - this landscape is not a view of Rome, it is a landscape based on literary sources, one that Mantegna enriched in his typical fashion with archeological props.The right arcade on the west wall contains the scene interpreted as the chance encounter between Ludovico Gonzaga and his son, Cardinal Francesco. The painting also can be seen as a presentation of three generations in the male line of the Gonzaga. The cluster of sons and grandsons around the marchese, who is here portrayed a second time, illustrates an aspect of the dynasty of fundamental importance for its continued health. The line of succession is assured, with a division of power in each generation between those selected for secular career and those called to a life in the Church. The depiction of the marchese with his oldest son, Federico (his mirror image at the left side of the picture), as well as Federico's son Francesco (the boy to the left) clearly suggests the continuity of the dynastic line. By contrast, the powerful central figure of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga and the two boys he holds by the hand - Sigismondo and Ludovico Gonzaga, who would also later enter the Church - assure us that with the succession of clerical dignitaries it produces the family has an ongoing tie to the Curia and to the pope.In the centre three putti standing atop the cornice above the door support the painted dedication tablet.The scene beneath the left arcade shows a groom leading a saddled horse, a pair of hunting dogs, and a page holding one of the dogs on a leash. Two more men stand to the left of the door beneath the central arch, one of them holding a sealed letter in his hand. In front of them are two more leashed dogs partially obscured by the pilaster

16836-portwom1.jpg	The woman is traditionally identified as Isabella d'Este.The artist was a leading assistant of Raphael in Rome before being appointed court artist to the Gonzagas at Mantua in 1524. Apart from his skills as a painter, architect and designer, he has the distinction of being the only Italian artist referred to by name by Shakespeare (in The Winter's Tale).The painting was first recognised as a work by Giulio Romano and identified as a portrait of Isabella d'Este in the eighteenth century. Although both the attribution and the identification have been challenged, there is a general consensus that the portrait is by Giulio Romano. The treatment of the architecture in particular is comparable with the backgrounds of the Madonna della Gatta (Naples, Capodimonte) and the Virgin and Child (Rome, Galleria Nazionale). In general terms, the composition reveals a debt to the Portrait of Giovanna d'Aragona (Paris, Louvre), which was probably designed by Raphael, but painted with the assistance of Giulio Romano.The identification of the sitter has recently become the subject of discussion. Isabella d'Este (1474-1539), one of the foremost patrons of the arts in Renaissance Italy, married Giovanni Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, in 1490. She was notoriously reluctant to be painted and her personal iconography is severely limited. The principal images are two portraits by Titian: Isabella d'Este in Black (about 1534-36) and Isabella d'Este in Red (both in Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum). In these works, as well as in the famous drawing by Leonardo da Vinci dating from 1500 (Paris, Louvre) and a medal by Giancristoforo Romano of 1498, the face is round, the forehead low and the neck short. These are features that do not accord with the sitter in the present portrait. The age of the sitter also seems incompatible as Isabella d'Este would have been fifty when Giulio Romano arrived in Mantua. Furthermore, the knot patterns on the dress, often associated with the personal motif created for Isabella d'Este by Niccol&#242; da Correggio in 1493, were a widespread fashion.An alternative identification of the sitter with Margherita Paleologo (1510-66), who married Isabella d'Este's son, Federico Gonzaga, the first Duke of Mantua, in 1531, has been proposed. Contemporary descriptions suggest a closer likeness ('the skin white like snow, the face a little long with a nose like her father's) and there is an abundance of evidence for Margherita Paleologo's interest in clothes and ornaments. It has been suggested that the portrait was made at the time of her wedding, and that the veiled figure entering the room in the background is Isabella d'Este. The Marchesa is attended possibly by her other daughter-in-law, Isabella of Capua, and a nun, Margherita Cantelma, Duchess of Sora (died 1532). Although the documentary evidence is persuasive, final visual confirmation is lacking.There are signs of a figure (perhaps a putto) in the upper left corner, which may indicate that the artist had used the panel on a previous occasion for a different composition. The elegant figure of the maid pulling back the curtain may have been inspired by the sculptural figures on early funerary monuments, for example, on the tomb of Cardinal de Braye (died 1282) by Arnolfo di Cambio (Orvieto, San Domenico)

32316-14hagar.jpg	The unusual format and the distinctive asymmetrical composition of the scene, with Hagar seeming to exit the painting, are characteristic of the last phase of Poussin's career. Likewise, the uncertain and tremulous brushwork, which gives figures and objects an evanescence, derives to the illness of the aging painter who was no longer able to hold the brush as firmly as he previously had. Far from the serene visions of the artist's youthful periods, this extraordinary landscape is described as menacing and inhospitable with looming black clouds and wild vegetation. Almost lost among these, and scarcely visible, the tiny figure of Hagar moves. Pregnant by Abraham, driven out of her village by the jealous Sarah, she seems here almost annihilated by the power of the nature which surrounds her. The only note of colour is the luminous angel above, who orders Hagar to turn around and retrace her steps: he alone is illuminated by the sun, the source of life and symbol of Hagar's own fertility

44768-shepherd.jpg	In 1638 Zurbar�n received order from the Carthusians of Jerez which consisted principally of two parts: five large and two small canvases for the monumental altarpiece of the church, and eight portraits of distinguished members of the order, accompanied by two images of angels with censers, which were installed in a narrow passageway leading to a small room behind the altar where the host was kept. Four of the major altarpiece paintings depict the Infancy of Christ, and for sheer magnificence of colour and spectacle, they are unsurpassed in the artist's work. One of these paintings is the Adoration of the Shepherds.Zurbar�n's painting is populated by rough, plain countryfolk, who have been toasted by the sun and beaten by the weather. In compliance with the strict local rules for religious imagery, all the figures are fully clothed. Zurbar�n seeks to establish an atmosphere of quiet reverence and concentrates attention on the upper bodies and faces; anatomical correctness is not essential to this enterprise and therefore he does not attempt to show the legs below the knee, leaving them to be furnished in the viewer's imagination. Instead he dwells on the smallest inanimate details - the woolly fleece of the lamb, matted with caked, dried mud; the rough weave of the multi-coloured mantle covering the bed of straw; the dry, bony shells of the eggs - and makes them comes to life

20781-educatio.jpg	The Golden Legend, drawing on the apocryphal gospels, tells how the Virgin Mary was brought up as a child in the Temple at Jerusalem 'with other virgins'...and was visited daily of angels', since it had been foretold to her parents, Joachim and Anne, that their daughter was to be consecrated to the Lord as the 'chosen vessel' of Christ's Incarnation. The theme became popular in the 16th century and remained so after the Counter-Reformation in spite of some disapproval by the Church because of its apocryphal character. Mary is seen in earlier examples teaching her young companions, sewing the priest vestments or being ministered to by angels who bring bread and water. But the favourite theme, especially in Counter-Reformation art, depicts her education in the strict sense, at the knee of her mother Anne, learning to read.You can view other depictions of the Education of the Virgin in the Web Gallery of Art

11121-early12.jpg	Degas's family were related to the Italian aristocracy, among them Baroness Bellelli and Duchess Morbilli. In 1856 he traveled for the first time to Italy, where he intended to make the acquaintance of his Italian relatives. This journey, which was followed by another in 1858 and several more in 1859, was Degas's real education. In Italy, Degas preferred the Quattrocento painters and the exponents of Florentine Mannerism.The people Degas depicted in that time were almost all members of his family, especially his sisters and brothers, and himself. His early portraits achieve their culmination in his group portrait The Bellelli Family.Degas produced many portraits between 1865 and 1870, too, the major ones of which were Th�r�se de Gas, Double Portrait, The Collector, Madame Hertel, Duke and Duchess of Morbilli, Jacques Joseph (James) Tissot, Mademoiselle Dihau at the Piano, Madame Camus at the Piano, Portrait of Hortense Valpin�on as a Child.Conventional as they may be, these portraits highlight both what is characteristic and what is casual in the personality and deportment of the sitter

05567-10calumn.jpg	Botticelli's theme was drawn from a famous painting by the Greek artist Apelles, described in classical sources. It was a well-known work in the 15th century. Lucian's description of this lost work by the classical artist had been widely translated. Apelles produced his painting because he was unjustly slandered by a jealous artistic rival, Antiphilos, who accused him in front of the gullible king of Egypt, Ptolemy, of being an accomplice in a conspiracy. After Apelles had been proven to be innocent, he dealt with his rage and desire for revenge by painting this picture.In his painting, Botticelli kept the scenic structure of the composition of the figures to Lucian's description, and created a lavishly decorated architectural backdrop for them.An innocent man is dragged before the kings throne by the personifications of Calumny, Malice, Fraud and Envy. They are followed to one side by Remorse as an old woman, turning to face the naked Truth, who is pointing towards heaven. The nakedness of Truth places her in a relationship with the innocent youth, whose folded hands are also an appeal to a higher power

09341-townhall.jpg	The fa�ade of the town hall, together with the new wing in the Zijlstraat was designed and built by Lieven de Key in 1620, who became the stadsbouwmeester of Haarlem in 1593. The original building was constructed by Count William II in 1250, and served as a hunting lodge. After burning down in 1351, its remains were donated to the city of Haarlem by Count William V. It was then rebuilt in the 15th Century, to serve as the town hall. The outlines today are more or less the same as when Ten Compe painted it, although the tower, which was demolished in 1772, has been rebuilt in 1913.

15618-adorati.jpg	This is the only surviving painting by Ridolfo which is both signed and dated. It is inscribed on a cartello strip at the lower centre as RIDOLFUS GRILLANDAIUS FLORENTINUS FACIEBAT INSTANTE IOHANNE ITALIANO PETRI M.D.X. The unusual use of the word 'italiano' to indicate the patron's nationality suggests that it was produced for export. The signature implies too that Ridolfo felt unusual pride in this single painting and his Florentine birth, which can be taken as a sort of demonstration piece of his talents.The presence of the two plague saints, Roch and Sebastian, kneeling in the first plane before the Christ Child is possibly relevant for unraveling the circumstances of the commissioning of the panel, since they are anachronistic to the principal scene of the Adoration. The background has a Northern European character. The composition has the characteristics of a Quattrocento painting, but the style is more simplified and less ornamental

The supreme example is the ceiling composition executed by Baciccio (Giovanni Battista Gaulli) in Il Ges&#249;, the most spectacular of a fresco program encompassing virtually the entire church that Baciccio worked on for thirteen years (1672-85).

14433-107fried.jpg	Friedrich can be regarded as the consummate master of early Romantic landscape painting. His work would have sufficed by itself to form our notion of Romantic painting. The symbolic language of his landscapes derives its vocabulary from the study of nature, and is based on a meditative internalisation of the experiences of the senses.This painting conveys Friedrich's impressions of the countryside in the Bohemian mountains south of Teplitz. Our gaze is taken to the right to Mount Milleschauer, and then, because of the painting's symmetrical structure, to the equally sweeping profile of a second mountain, the Kletschen, to the left. The eye returns from the bluish-green silhouette of these distant mountains to the luscious green sloping pastures at the front. From there it travels down the path to the low-built house in the valley lying, half-concealed, amidst the trees and bushes; the presence of human life is revealed by the column of smoke rising from its chimney. Or we may climb in our minds up the hill to the right of the house, which becomes  an increasingly pale yellowish-green with height, perhaps to gain an even better perspective of the landscape.

18216-0309grec.jpg	A translation in paint of Michelangelo's late sculptured group of the Piet&#224; in Florence Cathedral, at the time in Rome. The pattern and the feeling are the same. The figures of the Dead Christ, His Mother, Saint Mary Magdalene and Joseph of Arimathea make one compact group. Michelangelo achieved this by his new treatment of form; El Greco by paint, by employing broader, more continuous passages of colour. The more vivid colours of Rome combine with the richer palette of Venice to convey the intensity of expression demanded by the subject. The horizontal composition of Venice, more suited to a narrative type of subject than to the single image, is given up and is only very rarely found appropriate in Spain.Michelangelo's Piet&#224; group was not the only source on which El Greco drew: the arrangement of Christ's legs and his outspread arms, no less than the idea of viewing one of the two bearers of his body from the side and the other from behind, derive from Michelangelo's drawing for Vittoria Colonna, in which, as in El Greco's painting, the Virgin is placed behind and above Christ. In the collection of the Hispanic Society of America is a larger version of the subject, unsigned, in oil on canvas, for which this may be a study. The subject is not repeated in Spain

18277-0816grec.jpg	The central figure is closely based on El Greco's earlier painting of a Boy Blowing on an Ember in Naples but the scene has been enlarged to include another male figure, wearing a yellow jacket and red cap, and a, who emerges from the darkness on the left to look over the boy's shoulder. The composition, known in two other autograph versions (one earlier of similar size in private collection from around 1578, and another smaller and later in the Prado from around 1600), has usually been interpreted as an allegory with some sort of moralising intent; it is unlikely that it was conceived simply as a genre scene.

44095-5jerome.jpg	The little painting actually shows two scenes from the life of this Doctor of the Church. In the foreground he uses a small instrument to take a thorn out of a lion's paw. In the background he is chastising himself. But unlike this latter episode, which goes back to a true fact in the saint's life, notably his penitential retreat into the wilderness as a hermit from 375 to 380, the taking off of his cardinal's clothes and beating his breast with a stone are fictitious. The legend that he was a cardinal, and that during a reading to his disciples in Bethlehem he was approached by a limping lion with a thorn in its paw, only originated in the thirteenth century. The canonical jurist Joannes Andreas of Bologna (c. 1330-1348) made use of this to propagate the cardinal's function and the lion as fixed attributes of St Jerome.The composition of this painting has been altered in various places so that all conclusions which have hitherto been reached as to the authorship and the relationship to similar compositions need to be treated with caution. The lion was originally painted with both paws on the ground and with its head in profile, while Jerome's right arm pointed more in the direction of the book, which may originally have been a writing tablet. His hat also hung on his back and he was not lying on the ground. It is not possible to establish when these alterations took place. Judging by the scene in the background which also seems to have been added later, it might have been by a later, weaker hand. The work is unmistakably Rogierian in style, which also corresponds with the age of the panel. It is difficult to evaluate the extent to which the work has suffered in quality from the interventions of his studio

Tmolos, who was asked to be the judge, is seated in the centre; he turns toward the divine musician and waves silence to the wildly dancing Pan.Moving towards the front, between the two of them, is the foolish king of Lydia, Midas, who in contradiction with the wise judgment, voted for the victory of Pan's instrument. He is already wearing the ass's ears he received from Apollo for this. In some catalogues this painting is also known as ""Apollo and Marsyas"", although the artist was consistent in identifying Pan, who can be easily recognized by the goat hooves and the syrinx held in his hand. In this picture Apollo's stringed instrument is a Renaissance lira da braccio which is played with a bow. The female figures framing the composition on the left are Muses; the water jugs are usually the attributes of Poesia. On the right we can see Pan's escorts: satyrs and nymphs. The woman holding a trumpet is probably not Fama, the personification of fame, rather, she is simply introducing another type of wind instrument which has been scorned.The Northern European painter placed the events of classical mythology into a romantic, mountainous setting"

29391-castle1.jpg	Nasmyth developed the landscape style for which he is best known, which invariably involved integrating topographical details of country houses and castles within a picturesque context.He is recorded as having exhibited three paintings of Tantallon, in addition to this especially dramatic, almost operatic, view, which is thought to date from c. 1816, and is one of the finest of his maritime pictures. A related drawing of a shipwreck is in the collection of the National Gallery of Scotland. It is probable that he chose to treat the subject because the fourteenth-century Tantallon Castle, which is located outside North Berwick, was so memorably described in Sir Walter Scott's epic poem Marmion, along with a 'gathering ocean- storm,' (Nasmyth provided numerous illustrations for collected editions of Scott's poems). He also uses it, however, to explore a type of romantic coastal scene most readily associated with the great mid-eighteenth-century French painter, Claude-Joseph Vernet.

08719-idlehour.jpg	Teaching in public or state art schools by artists associated with Impressionism was of central importance in the American dissemination of the new art and its ideas. Summer schools devoted to open-air painting became established in the 1890s as an integral part of American art teaching. The most popular and successful of the schools was the Shinnecock Summer School, opened on Long Island in 1891. It was founded by William Merrit Chase who taught the methods and practice of open-air painting there for twelve consecutive summers.The carefree cheerfulness that Chase's canvases emanate became increasingly Impressionist in technique as the 1890s wore on. He became master of the flickering atmospherics of light set off by blue strips of sea or sky and enlivened by women and children in bright summer dresses. The dunes and beaches of Shinnecock on Long Island provided Chase with his staple material. A particularly fine example of this period in his work is Idle Hours

07598-58rosar.jpg	In its huge scale and multi-figured design the grandest of Caravaggio's paintings, this may have been commissioned by the Duke of Modena in 1605 and undertaken in Naples. It was offered to the Duke of Mantua in 1607 and was bought by a consortium of Flemish artists, including Rubens, by whom it was offered to the Dominican church in Antwerp.The theme is Dominican. St Dominic and his friars spread the devotion of the rosary; and here the Madonna, as Queen of Heaven, issues orders to the saint to her right, who clutches a rosary, and the Dominican St Peter Martyr to her left. Beside St Peter Martyr stands the most famous of Dominican theologians, St Thomas Aquinas.Madonna, Child and saints form a heavenly triangle concealed from the classically costumed suppliants at the front, who kneel in prayer with arms outstretched to St Dominic, while a donor in modern ruff and doublet eyes the viewer. The column to the left and the curtain overhead add to the formality of the scene. Caravaggio achieves an elaborate ordering and interlocking of forms that heralds the typical Baroque altarpiece

41293-09stanne.jpg	The painting originates from Eperjes.In a votive picture donated by Senator J�nos H�tter this subject is fully represented: the painter also included portraits of the donor and his sons. Behind him his patron saint, John the Evangelist, is seen standing with his right arm resting on the shoulder of the praying figure. Another rare addition is the figure of St. Joseph behind the Virgin. The interior may have been inspired by a D�rer print: the spacious effect produced by the barrel vault and the ample use of Renaissance style architectural decorative element were surely meant to create an atmosphere of solemnity. The balusters of the terrace railing closely resemble those of the outside staircase of the Town Hall in B�rtfa, completed in 1509 and considered a novelty in the whole neighbourhood at that time.The main motif of the skilfully painted landscape in the background, namely the mill to which people are seen carrying corn for grinding, is evidently not just a charming genre scene but is also of symbolic significance. Just as the corn has to be ground between mill-stones to make flour which thus is the basis of the bread for the Eucharist, so Jesus, held with anxious care and great reverence between the two saintly women and touched by them only through a clean white veil, has to die a bitter and painful death to bring about the redemption of mankind.The panel is strikingly Augsburgian in style, for it aspires to a very Italianate appearance which the master tries to attain with his putti, architectural details and other small motifs. The face of the Senator recalls D�rer's Fugger portrait. This odd resemblance may be due to the fact that the Thurz�-Fugger mining and trading company was at the height of its power and activity in those years and it may have been through this family that the master was subjected to this otherwise rare artistic influence

30994-death_da.jpg	This a big canvas was painted around 1746 by Giambattista Piazzetta for the hall of the Palazzo Pisani Moretta in San Polo, where it was accompanied by a painting by Paolo Veronese depicting Alexander and the Family of Darius, taken to the National Gallery in London during the nineteenth century. This is one of the masterpieces of the historical genre mainly cultivated by Piazzetta in his later work. An intensely dramatic work, marked by an exceptional maudlin tension, it shows examples of great pictorial skill in the overall plotting of the scene, in the statuesque figure of Alexander and in the abandoned bodies of the Persian king and his horse, all touched by a leaden light.The painting, formerly in the Palazzo Pisani, was much admired in the past for its attractive colours and beautiful effects of light.

07466-08cardsh.jpg	The Cardsharps, lost for almost a century, has been found and is now in Texas, and helps to fill in an important stage in the development of Caravaggio's art. Behind a table that protrudes into the spectator's space, a youthful innocent studies his cards, overlooked by a sinister middle-aged man, whose fingers signal to another, younger scoundrel to his right, who holds a five of hearts behind his back. To the left-hand side of the canvas is the object of their conspiracy, a pile of coins.This low-life scene links Caravaggio's discreet dramas to the genre paintings favoured by his followers. It was to have many imitators - within a few years of the painter's death an early variant had been painted by the Franco-Roman Valentin de Boulogne - but few equals. Caravaggio was less melodramatic than many of the artists known as the Caravaggisti who painted in his style, and he suggests only enough of the interaction between the three actors to imply the sequel

09621-venus_cu.jpg	This painting is probably the companion-piece of The Education of Cupid in the National Gallery, London. It shows a lustful satyr uncovering Venus sleeping in sensuous abandon on the ground. She represents the Terrestrial Venus' of carnal passion. In the National Gallery canvas, a winged Venus and Mercury unite in instructing Cupid, as married lovers educate their offspring or the benevolent planets which these divinities personify influence children born under their zodiacal signs. This 'Celestial Venus', however, appears no less desirable than her earthly Parisian sister.The painting is sometimes erroneously called The Sleep of Antiope.

33640-23sp1669.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 55.No one in the 17th century played the game of literary and social roles so extravagantly and with so much variety as the Dutchman Rembrandt. In almost 90 self-portraits, he proved how autobiographical interest and the insatiable curiosity of staging could, time and again, bring forth different variations on the theme of self-depiction. Rembrandt's visual casting plan ranges between lofty personal dignity (representation as apostle or ruler) and base characters (beggar, fool, executioner). And at the focus of all his appearances facial expression is the dramatic, and often enough experimentally exploited field of constant metamorphosis. Role-play and existential profundity need not contradict each other in any way in this process. What that means, is demonstrated by this late self-portrait

40790-duke_rud.jpg	Stylistic analyses of the portrait of Rudolf IV have regularly spotlighted its links with the Prague court art of just a few years earlier, and with its leading protagonist, Master Theoderic. The Vienna painting also features other innovations derived from Bohemian painting. In view of the numerous artistic exchanges taking place between Bohemia and Austria, however, it is equally conceivable that the portrait was the work of an Austrian artist.Although this portrait was later hung near Rudolf's tomb, there is no reference to his death in the inscription. That it may have been commissioned by Rudolf himself is further indicated by the fact that he is portrayed as an archduke {Archidux, as the Latin inscription reads), a rank which Rudolf unlawfully awarded himself. If the painting was indeed executed before 1365, it is the oldest autonomous portrait in the history of German art. It was admittedly intended less to capture an accurate likeness, however, than to reinforce Rudolf's political status. The shape of the bow evidently cites more or less exactly the bow in the crown of the Bohemian king Charles IV, whose daughter Catherine Rudolf married in 1357. The solidity of the areas of flesh contrasts abruptly with the treatment of the blonde hair and in particular the very two-dimensional portrayal of the serrated hat and the coat

12584-7reesen.jpg	The man in the portrait holds a message on which the first few letters of his name can be read `P[or B]ernh', the rest being hidden by the fingers of his left hand. This is almost certainly the painting to which D�rer refers in his Antwerp diary in late March 1521, recording that he had `made a portrait of Bernhart von Resten in oils' for which he had been paid eight florins. D�rer's reference is probably to Bernhard von Reesen (1491-1521), a Danzig merchant whose family had important business links with Antwerp. His name suggests that his family originated from Rees, a town on the Lower Rhine 100 miles east of Antwerp.D�rer's tight composition cuts off the two edges of Reesen's hat, emphasizing his brightly lit face. The dark clothing and hat also draw attention to his features - his pronounced cheekbones, forceful chin and youthful expression. His eyes stare out into the distance. Reesen, who was 30 when he was painted, died from the plague just a few months later in October 1521.The well-preserved state allows for a full appreciation, from a formal point of view and a pictorial one, the mastery of the painter. He gives the thirty-year-old subject an intense physical and spiritual charm. This work further demonstrates the extraordinary span of D�rer's portraiture up until his final years

Today we know of more than ten autograph versions, the most important of which are those showing the departure or arrival of the Bucintaur in the foreground instead of the ordinary plying of boats, as here.It is highly likely that for this composition Canaletto used the ""optical camera"", an instrument which facilitated the control of perspective in such a wide and ""unnatural"" field of vision.

32969-06cecil.jpg	Raphael probably accompanied Leo X when he went to Bologna to meet the King of France, Francis I, in 1515. He may have passed through Florence, where Leo was welcomed with great enthusiasm by his fellow citizens. Leonardo da Vinci - who later accepted the French King's invitation to Paris - and Michelangelo - to whom Leo X commissioned the New Sacristy of San Lorenzo - also followed the Pope.A letter which Raphael sent to the painter, Francesco Francia, provides proof of this journey. According to a legend, Francesco Francia died after seeing the St Cecilia which Raphael painted for the Church of San Giovanni in Monte in Bologna. The story is almost credible, for the Bolognese artistic environment still revolved around the style of Perugino. The painting was commissioned by Elena Duglioli dall'Olio of Bologna. She was famous for having visions and ecstatic fits in which music played a great part, which is probably why she asked for a picture of St Cecilia, the patron saint of music. Raphael decided on a painting in the style of a Sacra Conversazione, with St Cecilia in the centre surrounded by saints. The altarpiece, which is now in the Museum of Bologna, was placed in San Giovanni in Monte in 1515. It was painted some time before, however.The glorification of purity is the central idea behind this painting. This is expressed by the figures seen on both sides of the principal figure: St John the Evangelist is the patron saint of the church, and St Paul symbolizes innocence, while St Augustine and St Mary Magdalene stand for purity regained through atonement after sinful aberration. The four saints who surround the protagonist form a niche which is strengthened by the poses and gestures of the figures (the glances of the Evangelist and St Augustine cross, St Paul's is lowered and the Magdalene turns hers toward the spectator). Only St Cecilia raises her face toward the sky, where a chorus of angels appears through a hole in the clouds. The monumentality of the figures, typical of Raphael's activity during this period, dominates the other figurative elements.In the legend of St Cecilia, too, the painter emphasizes her desire to preserve her purity. As they were escorting Cecilia to the house of her betrothed, to the accompaniment of musical instruments, in her heart she called out only to God, beseeching Him to preserve the chastity of her heart and her body.So runs the fifth-century legend, and accordingly in this picture Cecilia does not hear the profane music, her eyes raised toward the heavens connects her directly with the choir of angels. This much is in complete agreement with the story of the Roman martyr.

19871-8kratze.jpg	"Kratzer (1487 - c.1550) was born in Munich and studied in Cologne and Wittenberg. From a letter sent by Petrus Aegidius to Erasmus on January 19, 1517, we know that ""Nicolaus Bavarus"" was due to travel from Antwerp to Brussels to sell astronomical equipment. In the same year, Kratzer was appointed professor in Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and henceforth remained in England. A humanist, he was a close friend of Thomas More and from 1519 the royal court astronomer in the service of Henry VIII. He was employed by both More and Cardinal Wolsey (whose downfall occurred a year after the portrait was painted).The painting is pivotal in many respects. Despite being a product of his first stay in England, Holbein developed the allusive style of illustrating his sitter's career (as a maker of mathematical and geometrical instruments) to new levels of coherence. Although a display of similar items was to recur in The Ambassadors, there they are passive witnesses of mental concerns, while the refreshing directness of Kratzer's practical involvement means that his character is not buried by the artist's determination to include convincing still-lives.Compared with the Guildford portraits, a new mastery is evident, in the subtlety of lighting, the elegant range of cream, brown and black tones in the pattern of instruments against the wall, and in the presentation of Kratzer's idiosyncratic heavy-lidded gaze. It is revealing to contrast this humane mood with the archly aristocratic tone of Bronzino's Ugo Martelli"

17557-15portra.jpg	Gossart was probably trained in Bruges before becoming a master in Antwerp in 1503. He entered the service of Philip of Burgundy, later Bishop of Utrecht, an illegitimate son of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. In 1508, when Philip went on a mission to the Vatican, Gossart probably accompanied him to record ancient monuments, seemingly the first Flemish artist to do so. The trip had a momentous effect not only on his own work, but on Netherlandish art in general. Under the impact of Gossart and like-minded 'Romanists', the native pictorial tradition rooted in the work of van Eyck and van der Weyden was rejected in favour of an Italianate Renaissance idiom ultimately based on ancient Greco-Roman sculpture, anatomical studies and mathematical perspective.The picture illustrated here shows his mature style, in this instance equally compounded of Italianate elements and Flemish naturalism. It is the artist's only known double portrait. Unlike many of Gossart's sitters, these elderly people seem to belong to the prosperous bourgeoisie rather than the nobility. Shown in bust-length against a dark green background, they are strongly lit from the upper left. The light unites them within the picture space, revealing underlying structure, while at the same time accentuating the different tinges of their flesh and the sagging of their tired skin.The badge on the man's hat shows two naked figures with a cornucopia, perhaps an ironic comment on the sitters' present state. Yet in an age when toothlessness and wrinkles were subjects of ridicule, Gossart endows the couple with enormous stoical dignity. The man, more active, grasps his fur collar and the metal head of a cane, and looks sternly ahead. But the woman, posed behind him with her hands concealed, her eyes downcast, is no less firm. Her white head-dress is reflected on her cheek and chin and casts a translucent shadow on her forehead, thus lightening the tonal contrasts visible in her husband's face, and at the same time giving her an equal share of monumental authority

01093-cassiano.jpg	Left side: Saint Nicholas and Saint Maddalena, 56 x 35 cmCenter: Madonna, 115 x 65 cmRight side: Saint Ursula and Saint Dominique, 56,8 x 35,6 cmLittle is known about the artist, except for what has been handed down by Vasari, and later by Ridolfi. The works are attributed to Messina above all because of the strength of the new style of painting, claimed to have been inspired by a journey to Flanders. Still, the artist had his first grounding in the South of Italy. It was certainly here that he brushed shoulders with the Flemish painters and grafted onto his painting a new visual dimension, using colours to broaden space into more airy vistas.In 1475 he was staying in Venice and the San Cassiano altar-piece came as a sequel to a series of works, including the Antwerp crucifixion, and a number of portraits. Designed round a novel architectonic skeleton, this canvas came to be the inevitable model and paragon for all the prestigious painters of the age, from Bellini, with his San Giobbe altarpiece, to Giorgione, the painter of the Castelfranco altar, and Alvise Vivarini, whose altarpiece was destroyed in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum at Berlin in 1945.This particular work of Antonello's, which had so significant an influence on his artistic career, and also on the history of subsequent Venetian painting, disappeared from the Church of San Cassiano in the first decades of the 17th century. Ridolfi mentions it in 1648. Reduced to fragments, it reappeared in the collection of the Archduke Leopold William in Brussels, and was attributed to Giovanni Bellini. About this time, Teniers made copies and engravings of them. In 1700 three or so of the large fragments found their way to Vienna. The two side-wings remained unrecognised until 1928, when they were put on show by Wilde. The Madonna was displayed, attributed now to Bellini, now to Boccaccino (Wickhoff, 1893 and Berenson, 1916-17); the latter was the first to identify in this picture the centre-piece of the San Cassiano altar. Finally Wilde managed to trace the two lateral fragments and tried to reconstruct the whole (1929).This ambitious altarpiece was probably Antonello's most influential work. It has come down to us as a fragment, although by means of old copies, the sensible reconstruction indicates that even before Giovanni Bellini, Antonello produced a characteristically Venetian altarpiece

05374-flower_.jpg	One of the oldest types of still-life is the flower piece. It seems that flower painting was established as an independent category in the Netherlands during the third quarter of the sixteenth century, with the rise of a widespread interest in gardening and the cultivation of exotic flowers. The principal member of the group of flower painters during the first decades of the seventeenth century was Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder, the founder of a dynasty of flower and fruit painters.His prime work is the brilliantly coloured Bouquet in an Arched Window. Jacob de Gheyn II and Roelandt Savery painted similar multi-coloured bouquets in niches, but only Bosschaert showed flowers against an open vista. The painting's exquisite attention to detail recalls works by miniaturists. Of Baroque chiaroscuro there is not a trace. Each bloom in his typically axial symmetrical arrangement is given equal attention and is minutely analysed in an even light.Analysis of the flower pieces made by Bosschaert and other flower painters of his time reveals that their bouquets were seldom painted from life. They were assembled from a number of independent studies which serve as patterns. The pictures frequently show blossoms which bloom at different seasons of the year, and it is not unusual to find the same flower, shell, or insect in more than one picture. This manner of composing flower pieces was continued by later artists. Moreover, the huge bouquets are usually far too large for the roemers or vases that hold them. If set up in the studio they would surely topple over.

21887-apotheos.jpg	The picture shows a detail from the ceiling of the Salon d'Hercule.The figure of Hercules played an important role in the iconography of 17th-18th-century France. The French accepted the legend that the Trojan Hercules had been the tenth king of the Gaul. A Gallic Hercules (who was also the god of eloquence) was celebrated in honour of Fran�ois I. Furthermore, Henri IV and Louis XIII lent their features to the hero. Charles Le Brun went on to specialize in images of Hercules. He decorated with these images the ceiling of the Salon d'Hercule at the of the ch&#226;teau of Vaux-le-Vicomte in honour of the wealthy finance minister Nicolas Fouquet.At Versailles the Salon d'Hercule was built on the site of a former chapel in 1733.

37276-3s_louis.jpg	The predella panel with five scenes illustrates episodes from the Saint's life. The predella scenes are much more lively and realistic than the main panel; their animated narrative quality is more like the St Martin cycle.From left to right, in the first panel we find Louis accepting the nomination to Bishop of Toulouse on condition that he be allowed to enter the Franciscan Order. This event took place in secret in Rome in December 1296, in the presence of Boniface VIII; Louis's father, Charles II, for political reasons wanted his son to become Bishop of Toulouse, for he needed to have direct control over an area that was particularly important for the King of France, Philip the Fair. And who could be a more trustworthy Bishop than his own son? But Louis had already given up his throne in order to follow the example of St Francis, and he had no intention now of becoming a pawn in a political manoeuvre, for this went against his spiritual aspirations; so, in return for accepting this religious office (which was not religious at all. . . ), he requested to be allowed to enter the Franciscan Order.In the following panel Louis publicly takes his vows and is consecrated Bishop: this is the official conclusion, on 5 February 1297, of the secret agreement made between Pope Boniface and the Saint.The third scene is based on the proceedings for the canonization of Louis in 1308: with great modesty, the Bishop Saint served and fed the hungry. These scenes relate perfectly to the subject-matter of the altarpiece, the coronation of King Robert, for they exalt the humility of Louis: he is humble because he gave up his throne, he is humble in the presence of Boniface VIII, he is humble in his daily life. But the truth was different. Even more important than his humility, Louis was poor: poor like St Francis, poor like the unpopular Spirituals, and above all poor unlike a King's son, especially one who was a Bishop and had just been canonized. The patron who commissioned the painting (Robert of Anjou, Mary of Hungary, or any other member of the royal family) clearly requested Simone to conceal, or at least not to emphasize, this aspect of the Saint's virtue; he was to celebrate another aspect of it, equally valid from a spiritual point of view, and totally innocuous politically: Louis is a follower of Christ in his humility, not in his poverty.After the scene of Louis's Funeral, depicted as a magnificent ceremony worthy of a high prelate (actually, it appears that it was an austere and simple service), in the last panel we find the scene of a miracle involving a small child: a man prays with a statuette of St Louis in his hands asking for his intervention and his child, who had died shortly before, miraculously comes back to life. With its lively narrative quality and especially because of the iconography involving the death of a child, this scene is very similar to the episodes depicted in the altarpiece of the Blessed Agostino Novello.The spatial construction of the altarpiece, both in the main panel and in the predella scenes, shows a very conscious elaboration of Giotto's methods, which Simone had already used in the Assisi frescoes. The drapery of the cope, the lion's feet on the faldstool half-hidden by the dais, the geometric patterns on the carpet, as well as the arcades, loggias and the shadowy areas in the episodes below, are the product of very subtle perspective observations which reveal to what extent Simone had by this stage developed a mature approach to spatial construction and the reproduction of volumes

06176-01left.jpg	The picture shows the left wing of the Dijon Altarpiece.The unusual shape of this picture is due to the fact that it formed the side-panel of a triptych, and as such it had to fit the shape of the central shrine containing groups of sculptures. Broederlam endeavoured to fill all empty spaces with a more or less even distribution of painted forms. However, the spectator sees not only the central motif set out on a decoratively arranged plane, but can also look beyond into the depths of both the architectural and landscape aspects of the background.The Virgin receives the angel in a Gothic hall which is open on both sides; nearby there is a building with a circular ground-plan. Associated with this building we can see a hall running parallel with the plane of the picture, and ending at a two-storeyed building which is Italian in character. The architectural ensemble is rather loosely organized, because the painter wanted to express intricate symbolic ideas with the component shapes. (The somewhat oriental, vaulted church, for example, stands for the Old Testament and the Gothic hall for the New Testament, etc.) On the right-hand side of the panel Mary and Elizabeth meet in front of a bare, rocky, mountainous landscape. The background fills up the surface of the picture and adapts to the irregular lines of the frame, but, at the same time, it extends into depth too.The painter has imposed a unity on the surroundings of the two scenes in a variety of ways. One of these is the decision to depict the angel in an open-air setting. He contrasts the brownish, grassy ground outside the group of buildings with the gorgeous flower garden (hortus conclusus) on the left-hand side of the picture, but in this way natural surroundings are integrated with the stone buildings. The two parts of the composition are also ingeniously connected, the smooth plateau of the mountain fitting into the ledges of the round edifice. The Virgin is the static figure on each side, while the Archangel Gabriel and Elizabeth, corresponding in their colours, approach her from opposite directions. The course of their movements is emphasized by the structure of the building with the obliquely placed hall, and by the semicircular line of the precipice in the foreground of the landscape.But further devices, too, contribute to the unity of the composition: the clever use of the complicated form of the frame. Just as the golden ray, which originates from the mouth of God the Father and runs to the Virgin of the Annunciation, the slanting line of the frame leads to the Virgin of the Visitation. (If, in our imagination, we lengthen the divine beam of light upwards, it runs to the peak of the frame.) The upper right and bottom left corners are united by another diagonal line: the imaginary one that connects Gabriel, the Virgin and the angel, and there are additional echoes in the colours of the apparel of all the figures

09800-portlady.jpg	The portrait can be dated on stylistic grounds to around 1500 on the basis of a comparison with the figures in the Ghedini altarpiece - the Virgin with Four Saints &#151; of 1497 in the church of San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. Such a dating also accords with the style of the costume which is notable for its detachable sleeves and elegant ties. The singing colours and transparent shadows denote Costa's Ferrarese origins and are characteristic of his early work. The high degree of finish, most apparent in the careful delineation of the strands of hair, the use of gold highlights on the dress, and the close observation of the numerous attachments (necklaces and headband), suggest that the portrait was not only an important commission, but also that the painter was susceptible to Flemish art, which he could have seen in the Este collection at Ferrara. It is a refined image of a type frequently found in north Italian courts at the turn of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. At least two copies of the portrait are known. The pose has certain affinities with the Portrait of Cecilia Gallerani - the mistress of Lodovico Sforza - by Leonardo da Vinci, which dates from the mid 1480s.Some scholars attempted to identify the sitter with Isabella d'Este, but this is no longer accepted, primarily because Costa did not begin to work for this important patron until 1504. It is possible that the likeness is of a member of the Bentivoglio family, who held sway in Bologna until driven from the city by Julius II in 1506. Works by Costa were commissioned by members of the family and later, on the recommendation of Antongaleazzo Bentivoglio, the artist played a prominent part in the decoration of Isabella d'Esre's studiolo at the court of Mantua.The left edge of the panel has been bevelled at the back and may therefore have originally been hinged. This suggests that the painting may have formed the right wing of a diptych, perhaps celebrating a marriage. The left side of the diptych is lost. In the context of a marriage the lap-dog would symbolise fidelity

40763-07icon.jpg	The ancient Novgorod school of painting is a remarkable and singular phenomenon in Russian art. This is especially evident from 15th century icon painting. A refined work of art, this icon in the Hermitage collection was produced by a skilful master who preferred graceful delicate forms and elongated proportions. The icon depicts two holy warriors. The features of their faces are small, which is a characteristic of the Novgorod icon-painting school. The saints' light figures are full of inner movement and their feet barely touch the ground. They are draped with flowing cloaks. The faces are dark with sharply contrasting light spots. In the colour scheme based primarily on the combination of ochre, red, brown and green, the cinnabar cloak of Theodore Stratilates is a bright spot on a light background. The haloes still retain traces of their original gilding

32306-04selfpo.jpg	In the self-portrait at the Louvre the artist, wearing a dark green gown and with a stole thrown over his shoulders, is shown in a slightly different pose than in the earlier version in Berlin: posture is erect, his head turned to present an almost full-face view. His facial expression is more solemn, but also less decided. Instead of funeral symbolism, the setting is the artist's studio, lent strangely abstract quality by a staggered arrangement of three framed canvases, one behind the other, whose quadratic structure is echoed by the dark doorframe behind them. It is apparent that the canvas nearest to us is empty, except for a painted inscription. At the left on the second canvas there is a woman in front of a landscape, wearing a diadem with an eye; a man's hands are reaching out to hold her shoulders. This has been interpreted as an allegory: painting crowned as the greatest of arts.A tiny but highly significant detail is the ring Poussin is wearing on the little finger of his right hand, which rests on a fastened portfolio. The stone is cut in a four-sided pyramid. As an emblematic motif, this symbolized the Stoic notion of Constantia, or stability and strength of character.The painting is signed and dated: EFFIGIES NICOLAI POUSSINI ANDELYENSIS PICTORIS, ANNO AETATIS 56.

12592-4kleberg.jpg	In 1564, Willibald Imhoff, the child from the first marriage of Johannes Kleberger's second wife, Felicita Pirckheimer (who had first married Hans Imhoff, acquired the painting in Lyon from Johannes's son, David Kleberger. In 1588, it was sold by Willibald's heirs to Emperor Rudolph II. From Prague, it went to the Schatzkammer in Vienna and, in 1748, to the gallery.Among the three portraits D�rer painted in 1526 - Hieronymus Holzschuher, Jakob Muffel, and Johannes Kleberger (1486-1546) - the last was distinct for the format of the frame and for the depiction: the man, in fact, is sketched in a bas relief, in a half-bust, and inserted, classically, in a clypeus. It is an unusual depiction among D�rer's works, which has largely puzzled art historians. But since portraits in bas-relief on medallions were often found on the facades of Renaissance buildings in France, where Kleberger lived for a long time, it is quite likely that the patron himself had requested the artist to portray him in this way. D�rer's innovation was that of vivifying the portrait in bas relief on a medallion of fake stone, giving him the colours of a live, if pale, complexion. D�rer takes up again the age-old theme of the comparison of the figurative arts, or, more specifically, the discussion of the predominance of one on the other. He interprets this discussion by presenting an image in sculpture, with its light and shadow, giving at the same time the signs of a painted portrait. Thus, even while maintaining, in the steadiness of the gaze, the immobile plasticity of a sculpted image, characteristic of the portraits of emperors during classical times, the result is a particularly vivid portrait, since it expresses the power of the subject and his extremely ambitious character.Johannes Kleberger, on the whole, had good reason to be proud of himself: working for the Imhoff merchants in Bern and especially in Lyon - a city that, because of its geographical position, had become a huge trading centre with branches of very important German merchants - he had accumulated a sizable wealth that allowed him, in 1522, to provide a loan for Francis I of France. During his sojourn in Nuremberg, in 1525-26, he had D�rer paint his portrait and, after having married the daughter of Willibald Pirckheimer, Felicita, the widow of Hans Imhoff, he returned to Lyon, where he acquired various properties. In 1543, Francis I appointed him his valet de chambre. Johannes Kleberger thus became one of the ten wealthiest and most influential inhabitants of Lyon. He gave enormous financial donations to the city, as in 1531 when, during the plague epidemic, he gave 500 livres to benefit the orphans of the plague victims. He was called le bon Allemand, and a monument was erected in his honour, of which a replica still exists today. Upon his death, along with the bequests to the hospitals in Bern and Geneva, he left the French city huge sums to assign to charities. Yet the portrait D�rer delivers shows a very hard-looking man: a hardness underscored from the classical type of pose and from the indication of the coldness of the stone.Behind the inscription (E[FFIGIES] IOAN[N]I KLEBERGERS NORICI AN[N]O AETA[TIS] SVAE XXXX) lies the cabbalistic sign of the sol in corde leonis, which is the conjunction of the brightest star of Leo, with the sun that was taken from the De occulta philosophia of Agrippa von Nettesheim (1510). He, too, was a German whom Kleberger likely met in Lyon, and according to whom the men born under this sign were destined for greatness. The symbol also represents an amulet against melancholy. Even the symbol of Leo surrounded by stars, depicted in the upper-left corner of the painting, would have a divinatory significance and again, according to Agrippa von Nettesheim, it would represent the particularly fortunate position of the person portrayed. In the lower corners, to the left and right, are the redende Wappen (figurative coats of arms) of the Kleberger family

24435-medal2.jpg	The two heads that have been discovered in the jambs of the original two-light window behind the altar are supposed to be the work of two artists: the Iefthand one is by Masolino, the righthand one (this picture) by Masaccio, for the former is painted with a clearly marked outline and the latter is modelled directly with the use of light. But there are many scholars who disagree and believe that both heads are by Masolino.And the foliage pattern decorations that cover the jambs also appear to be the work of two different artists: the floral ornamentations above the two heads and the motif that frames the scene at the top, just under the window sill, are to be attributed to Masolino, whereas the decorations below the two medallions are more probably the work of Masaccio. But there is one scene that everyone agrees is by Masaccio: there are only two small fragments left of it, above the altar, but it was originally the scene of the Crucifixion of Peter

34355-seclusio.jpg	"In the Romantic period, the fairy tale was one of the unifying elements in Germany, sung to people of all social classes in their cradle. It was not coincidence that while the Brothers Grimm were collecting their fairy tale, painting also turned to this genre, as something felt specifically German. In the fairy tale the mysterious forest provides a stage rich in symbols, where real experience can be combined with dream and fear. This explains why the motif of the forest became so popular. It was at this time that nationalistic ideas begin to be linked with the forest. Just as Gothic (Which developed in France) was immediately declared a German style, the forest was now always ""the German forest"". In painting the theme also recalls old German landscape painting, as in the works of Albrecht Altdorfer and Wolf Huber, classifies as the Danube school.Richter's Genoveva in the Forest Seclusion shows us a sunlit opening in the depth of such a forest. Deep faith in God appears to lie like a protecting hand over the little group, seated amid the overpowering vitality of nature"

19867-6lady.jpg	The portrait of a lady with a squirrel, a speckle-breasted starling perched behind her - perhaps as a pun on her name or a coat-of-arms brought to life - is a wonderfully preserved example of Holbein's art at its most evocative. The picture may have been painted as one of a pair depicting husband and wife. A vague resemblance between this woman and Margaret Giggs, who appears in the sketch of the More family, has often led to her being identified as the adopted daughter of Thomas More. In fact, the shared features are limited mainly to the comparable fur cap, which Margaret wears in an individual study in the royal collection at Windsor. Apparently the headgear corresponded with contemporary English fashion. On stylistic grounds, the picture can be dated to Holbein's first visit to England.In her warm fur cap the lady seems impassive, her eyes eluding the viewer's glance. Holbein's skill differentiates meticulously between the textures of the white fur, white shawl and the translucent white cambric buttoned at her throat and gathered in a ruffle at her wrist. The squirrel was added later over the sitter's clothes. Her hands, rearranged to support him, are a discordant note: they look masculine, modelled perhaps on those of an assistant in the studio. Yet the bright-eyed animal is essential to our reading of the portrait. His bushy tail, suggestively poised between the lady's gentle swelling breasts, hints at a sensuous nature beneath her reticently monochrome English costume.This work demonstrates many of the features found in Holbein's work from his first English visit; the thoughtful, reserved expression of the sitter, less direct than in many later works, and the use of plant motifs to animate an otherwise flattened background. The lady's anonymity (she was most probably English and of the More circle, whose members were notably fond of animals) undoubtedly focuses attention on the meaning of the squirrel and starling's presence; these may have been intended as references to her name, or as living tokens of the family coat of arms. It is known that squirrels were often kept as pets at this time, while starlings are biddable companions. After the painting's recent cleaning, the squirrel's gleaming eye and soft fur have revealed Holbein to be as effective an animal painter as his German contemporary Hans Hoffman. Holbein's particular structural skill is evident in the way the squirrel's curling tail echoes the vine stem in the background, itself reminiscent of the Amerbach portrait

23440-lugano.jpg	The picture shows the rood screen of the church.In the Renaissance period the decoration of the church is frequently focused on the apse and the entrance wall. These terminal walls of extended interior spaces are visible from a great distance, catching visitors' attention. The decoration of the apse towers over the events of mass at the high altar; the decoration of the inside wall of the fa�ade serves as an admonition or reinforcement for the visitors as they leave the liturgical ceremony and the church. Large format in both places called for fundamental, weighty themes.Examples of large-scale painted apse recesses are common in the areas ruled by Venice but also in Emilia. A special form of decoration for end walls is found in Lombardy. Particularly in the monastery buildings of the Franciscan Observants, large rood screens cut across the nave of the church. These walls separate entirely the chancel area of the monks from the area of the lay brothers in front. The front of the wall, facing the space for the laity, would be used as a large surface for frescoes with scenes from the life and Passion of Christ.The partition in Santa Maria degli Angeli in Lugano was frescoed in 1529 by Bernardino Luini. In contrast to early examples, Luini unites the entire wall into a single picture plane. To achieve a huge, overwhelming scenographic effect, Luini relinquished any division of the wall into small parts. The view looks through an illusionistic architectural frame to an enormous, crowded panorama of the Crucifixion. In the foreground, the crosses, Christ's death, and reactions of people push right up to the viewer, as if to the edge of a stage. Small, separate subsidiary scenes are arranged in the background landscape. In a symmetrical arrangement, three episodes on the left that preceded the Crucifixion are contrasted with three episodes on the right that followed Christ's death

15501-4obsequ.jpg	"This scene is underneath the Test by Fire before the Sultan on the right wall.Grieving Franciscan brothers encircle the dead founder of their order. Some are kneeling in order to kiss the stigmata on his hands and feet. A figure dressed in red is bending over the dead body in order to examine the wound in the saint's side. This is Girolamo who like the doubting Thomas with Christ, doubted the stigmatisation of St Francis until he was able to touch the wound.To the left a priest is celebrating the funeral mass wearing a pair of spectacles on his nose - still an unusual motif, for Canon van der Paele in Jan van Eyck's Bruges Madonna of 1436 is still holding his spectacles, together with his book, in his hand. Vasari took such a liking to Ghirlandaio's priest that he wrote that he ""is so real that only the absence of sound proves him to be a painted image"". The distribution of the groups of figures is another variation - as is the Obsequies in the Saint Fina Chapel - of the composition created by Filippo Lippi in his Obsequies of Saint Stephen in Prato Cathedral. The sacred architecture is also derived from Lippi's fresco; Ghirlandaio, however, opens up his imaginary architecture at both sides, as he does in San Gimignano, with view onto a landscape.To the right is the Franciscan Order in all its simplicity, and with its kindly, somewhat rustic looking monks. The church in the background has a sober appearance, though it gives on to a Tuscan countryside lush with rivers and streams. Here too, lesser-known characters are portrayed, undoubtedly either the monks of the nearby church of Ognissanti, so dear to Domenico, or those of Santissima Trinita.Ghirlandaio had certainly been to see Giotto's fresco in Santa Croce, since he has used the same composition and distribution of masses in this scene. Indeed, the teachings of Giotto, and his style, must not be forgotten. But here Domenico is more joyful and serene. The delicate touches of grey and white can only be his. His too is the light that streams over the faces, that gives a warm serenity and infinite peace to the countenance of Francis, motionless in death, and that falls on the gilded yellow of the pillow, on the reds and blues, and on the white clouds in the sky. There is almost a country atmosphere about it, an air of church-square festivity, and there is a masterly touch in the interplay of carefully spaced hands, which assume an almost musical quality through Domenico's artistry"

31054-1miser01.jpg	In 1445 the Compagnia della Misericordia, a confraternity of Borgo San Sepolcro, commissioned Piero to paint a polyptych for them, within three years. According to the taste of the time, the polyptych was to be painted with precious colours and have a solid gold background. Piero did not respect the time limits set down in the contract, for he was busy working on other, more important projects. The polyptych was only finished almost twenty years later.The oldest parts are the two panels with St Sebastian and St John the Baptist, to the left of the main panel. No other figure of Piero's, more than this St Sebastian, shows such close connection with Masaccio's nudes, even in his rather graceless but realistic pose. A little later Piero painted the panels of the tympanum, with the Crucifixion in the centre, and St Benedict, the Angel and the Madonna of the Annunciation, and St Francis in the sides.

17806-710goya.jpg	Although many of his contemporaries were opposed to bullfighting (Charles III imposed restrictions on the sport; it was banned in 1808 but the ban was lifted by Joseph Bonaparte in 1810), there is every reason to believe that Goya was an aficionado. There is even some truth in the stories of his performance in the ring. Goya made portraits of several bullfighters and many paintings, drawings and engravings of the national sport. A scene of the baiting of young bulls {La Novillada}, in which he portrayed himself, was the subject of one of his early tapestry cartoons, and a rounding up of bulls (El encierro de los toros) was one of his decorations for the Osuna country residence. In 1816 he published the Tauromaquia, a series of 33 etchings, for which he had made many drawings. Among his last works executed in France is a set of four lithographs, the Bulls of Bordeaux.A Village Bullfight is one of his most impressive paintings of the subject. The sketchy style and dark tones create a vivid impression of the actions of the protagonists and of the dense crowd of spectators grouped round the scene. It was perhaps in a setting such as this that Goya himself sometimes entered the ring as an amateur bullfighter.

42810-4enthron.jpg	Paolo Veronese left his native Verona in 1553 to settle in Venice where he came under the influence of the Venetian figurative tradition and then Mannerism, in particular of Parmigianino and Giulio Romano. The rich and complex arrangement of his compositions is matched by a brilliant use of colour, characterized by the juxtaposition of complementary colours and a vibrant solar light. One of Veronese's principal works of the 1560s, the 'Enthroned Madonna and Child, with the Infant St John the Baptist and Saints' was painted for the Sacristy of the Venetian Renaissance church of San Zaccaria (restored in 1562). It is a fine example of the early works of Veronese with its harmonious richness of colour.The saints represented in this altarpiece (called Pala di San Zaccaria) are Joseph, Jerome, Justina of Padua and Francis. The young John the Baptist stands at the meeting point of the two compositional diagonals formed by the figures of St. Joseph, St Francis and St Jerome, who are invested with a look of detached spirituality. The colour is made vibrant by a continual juxtaposition of light and dark tones. Through an understanding of the interaction of colour every hue is intensified and enriched. The diapason of Veronesian colour is achieved in the portrayal of the Virgin and child set against the damask of the niche.This altarpiece still shows the influence of Mannerist culture in the calculated asymmetry of the group of the Madonna and Child and the affected poses of some of the saints. Unfettered by convention, Veronese has placed the infant St John the Baptist half naked at the centre of the composition

05289-3lastjud.jpg	The right wing of the triptych represents the Hell.Bosch must have been familiar with contemporary texts describing Hell. Their influence can be seen not only in his rendering of specific punishments, but also in the general topography of his Hell, including such features as the burning pits and furnaces, and the lakes and rivers in which the damned are immersed. Some of his monsters are also derived from traditional literary and visual sources. The vaguely anthropomorphic devils occur in many earlier Last Judgment scenes. Traditional, too, are the toads, adders and dragons which crawl over the rocks or gnaw at the vital parts of their victims.Into this more or less conventional fauna of Hell, however, Bosch introduced new and more frightening species whose complex forms defy precise description. Many display bizarre fusions of animal and human elements, sometimes combined with inanimate objects. To this group belongs the bird-like monster who helps carry a giant knife in the centre panel; his torso develops into a fish tail and two humanoid legs, shod in a pair of jars. To the right an upturned basket darts forward on legs, a sword clutched in its mailed fist. Disembodied heads scuttle about on stubby limbs; others possess bodies and limbs which glow in the darkness. Several fiends blow musical instruments thrust into their hind quarters, bringing to mind the farting devil encountered by Dante (Inferno, XXI, 139)

18863-raising.jpg	'Guercino' means 'squint-eyed' and is the unpromising nickname under which the artist Giovanni Francesco Barbieri won international fame. Coming from Cento, a small town equidistant between Ferrara and Bologna, he was virtually self-taught and like many seventeenth-century artists was able to choose his own influences. He looked to Bologna, to the work of the Carracci, and to paintings by Caravaggio in private collections, forging from these a lyrical idiom of his own.A local nobleman having lent him rooms in his house, Guercino founded there an Academy of the Nude, where he and his followers were able to draw from the model. The figure of Christ in this painting palpably relies on just such a study from life.This painting was commissioned by Cardinal Giacomo Serra, the papal legate to Ferrara.

39977-17early.jpg	The more orthodox and darker oil-painting style, with smoother surface, which can be seen in the portrayal of Lautrec's models at this time, can be attributed to the influence of L�on Bonnat, Lautrec's teacher. For instance, he painted a whole series of studies of the red-haired Carmen Gaudin, and an important picture entitled The Laundress.

27071-brothel.jpg	"Unlike a history painting, a genre picture does not generally refer to a written text. Its relation is to the popular, often crude and simplistic, metaphorical interpretation of the world. Genre picture, therefore, have a different structure from history painting, and that structure is one of their major characteristics. A history painting usually illustrates the decisive moment of the historical narrative to which it refers. For a genre painting, however, there never could be such a crucial moment: there was no story. A genre painting always presents a situation, which, through the introduction of key symbols, is reversed into a moral example.This is examplified by the ""Brothel Scene"", which shows an interior with a rather coy lady pouring a smartly dressed  young man a glass of wine. An elegant scene - until one perceives, farther back in the room, two dogs copulating. This crude and explicit detail associates the picture with a popular expression of Italian origin: ""As is the lady, so is her dog.""  And another proverb, saying that beautiful woman and sweet wine are full of dangers, may also apply here. So what at first seems a harmless, attractive scene, is suddenly reversed when the viewer encounters an explicit symbol, often hidden in the background"

14716-10hallet.jpg	Instinctive, unpompous, drawn to music and the theatre more than to literature or history, and to nature more than to anything, Gainsborough continues to enchant us, as the serious Reynolds seldom can. Suffolk-born, like Constable, he also became, within his means and times, a 'natural painter' - albeit of a very different kind. Although he said he wished nothing more than 'to take my Viol de Gamba and walk off to some sweet Village where I can paint Landskips', his feeling for nature encompassed much more than landscape. Children and animals, women and men, everything that dances, shimmers, breathes, whispers or sings, look natural in Gainsborough's enchanted world, so that 'nature' comes to encompass silks and gauzes, ostrich feathers and powdered hair as much as woods and ponds and butterflies. But this rapturous manner of painting, in which all parts of a canvas were worked on together with a flickering brush, only appears in mature works, such as this famous and splendid picture.In his early years in Sudbury, after his training in London restoring Dutch landscapes and working with a French engraver, Gainsborough's finish was less free. After moving to the resort town of Bath in about 1759, he found a metropolitan clientele, and discovered Van Dyck in country-house collections. Both were to be decisive, and the effects are best judged in his portraits of women sitters, on the scale of life, in which elegance and ease of manner combine with a new, more tender colour range and a loosening of paint texture. In 1774 he moved permanently to London, where he built up a great portrait practice, but also began to paint imaginative 'fancy pictures' inspired by Murillo. He never aspired to 'history painting' in the Grand Manner. His poetry resides mainly in his brush, not in compositional inventiveness.It was surely Gainsborough's own inclination, however, to interpret a formal marriage portrait, for which the sitters probably sat separately, as a parkland promenade. William Hallett was 21 and his wife Elizabeth, n�e Stephen, 20 when they solemnly linked arms to walk in step together through life. A Spitz dog paces at their side, right foot forward like theirs, as pale and fluffy as Mrs Hallet is pale and gauzy. Being only a dog with no sense of occasion he pants joyfully hoping for attention. The parkland is a painted backdrop, like those of Victorian photographers, yet it provides a pretext for depicting urban sitters in urban finery as if in the dappled light of a world fresh with dew.

42227-0213vela.jpg	The court appointment of Vel�zquez gave him few opportunities for religious painting, and only occasionally did he execute subject pictures, except during his Italian journeys. He was little influenced by other artists, though he profited from the Titians in the Spanish Royal Collection, and the visit of Rubens in 1628, which was his first contact with a great living painter, who was also a court painter. Whether or not it was Rubens who inspired him to visit Italy, it was due to Rubens's influence that he obtained permission to go. He left in August 1629, visited Genoa, Venice, Rome and Naples (where he met Ribera) and returned to Madrid in 1631. The Joseph's Bloody Coat Brought to Jacob shows his preoccupation with the male nude.Inspired by his study of Titian, but never lapsing into mere imitation, Vel�zquez has softened his line in this painting, which was completed in Rome in the year 1630. These influences are clearly illustrated by the detail of the little dog in the foreground of the picture, a feature often found in Tintoretto.The composition of this picture portrays the dramatic climax of the Biblical story, when the garments of Joseph, sold into slavery by his brothers, are dipped in the blood of a goat and shown to his old father Jacob, to make him believe that his favourite son is dead. The physical reactions of the participants in this grim story are very forcefully depicted. The setting is a large hall with its floor tiled in a chessboard pattern, a frequent element in the works of both Titian and Tintoretto. In the background, there is a view of a beautifully painted landscape.

15273-105geric.jpg	In expressing the predicament of the shipwrecked everywhere in the world, G�ricault had laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution. The Raft of the Medusa marks the first appearance in painting of 'the ugly' and thereby proclaims its scrupulous respect for the truth, however repulsive the truth might be. This concern for truth is integral to the Romantic temperament.For his Salon picture in 1819, G�ricault chose a dramatic episode &#151; the wreck of the frigate Meduse, which had set off with a French fleet on an expedition to Senegal, and had been lost in July 1816. The French admiralty was accused of having put an incompetent officer in charge of the expedition; he was the Comte de Chaumareix, a former emigre who had not commanded a vessel for twenty-five years. The picture was an enormous success, more on account of the scandal than because of an interest in the arts; but G�ricault only received a gold medal, and his picture was not bought by the government. One wonders who it was suggested commissioning this painter of horror subjects to do a Sacred Heart.G�ricault was mortified, and decided to exhibit his picture in England, where a pamphlet had been published on the wreck of the Meduse. He entrusted the vast canvas to an eccentric character named Bullock (as Lethi�re had done with his Brutus Condemning his Sons), and it was exhibited in London from 12 June to 31 December 1820, and in Dublin from 5 February to 31 March 1821. G�ricault received a third of the takings, and the operation brought him in quite a large sum (probably 20,000 francs).The painting was priced at 6,000 francs at the posthumous sale of the artist's possessions. It was bought by Dedreux-Dorcy, a friend of G�ricault, for an additional five francs, and he sold it to the State for the same amount.The most horrifying part of the shipwreck had been the drama of 149 wretches abandoned on a raft with only some casks of wine to live on, and the ensuing drunkenness and abominations. When the frigate Argus found the raft, after many days, she was only able to rescue fifteen survivors, of whom five died after being brought ashore. After some hesitation, G�ricault chose this last episode &#151; the sighting of the Argus by the survivors on the raft. With regard to the latter, he set himself to the task of carrying out an inquest as thoroughly as any examining magistrate. He rented a studio opposite the Beaujon hospital, so that he could make anatomical studies of the dying.The picture was painted by G�ricault in an extraordinary state of tension; 'the mere sound of a smile prevented him from painting'

26058-16portra.jpg	With the exception of his devotional works, this painting is the only Memling portrait of an individual woman to have survived. At the same time, it functions as an exemplar of the well-to-do Flemish townswoman of the final decades of the fifteenth century. Her almost nun-like appearance, with her pale face and severely swept-back hair, starched, transparent headdress and dark clothes, is ornamented only by an olive-green belt, worn high, a wine-red chest-piece, and several rings and a necklace studded with precious stones. She poses in devout reverie against a darker void, her hands clasped primly together. The background is barely distinguishable now from her close-fitting, dark purple dress because its original bluish-green colour has darkened. The frame that surrounds her is marbled dark brown, with the date painted onto the imitation stone in the Eyckian manner, as if made up of inlaid gold or yellow metal letters.An earlier example of this type of portrait, with the same background, frame and date is the Portrait of Gilles Joye, dating from 1472. The Portrait ofJacob Obrecht also has this type of marbling on its frame. The portrait is somewhat disfigured by a painted metal cartouche top left and a banderole with an inscription on the frame at the bottom, which identify the woman as the Sibyl of Persia (SIBYLLA SAMBETHA QUAE / EST PERSICA). Judging from the style, these were added in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century. The fingertips painted over the frame are original. This trompe-l'oeil technique is an example of a process frequently applied by Memling with the aim of breaking through into the real space beyond the picture plane. The painted strip on which the sitter's hands rest is not a window-sill, but is seemingly intended as a continuation of the frame.The sitter of this celebrated portrait was identified in the 19th century as Maria, the second daughter of Willem and Barbara Moreel. However, later this identification was not generally accepted. The painting is also known as the Sibyl of Sambetha on account of an inscription on the scroll

37185-crucifix.jpg	"This work is a sketch for a monumental work by Silvestre measuring 291 x 201 cm. The full-scale version is described at length in an inscription in French by the artist, which can equally well be applied to the present sketch:""What one sees in this picture, a representation of Christ on the cross formed from clouds against a blue sky, was witnessed in the heavens next to the setting sun in the vineyards at Rotschberg at a quarter past six in the evening on 19 May 1734. The cross was perfectly formed for a quarter of an hour. Those present were: / M. L'Abbe Pirenne. C. [Catholic] / The younger M. Bildstein and his valet. L. [Lutheran] / M. Favrier. C. / Mme Embry. C. / The widow Richter. L. / The vine-tenders and the gardener. L. / Mme Sylvestre and her two daughters. C. / and myself, Louis Sylvestre, who painted what can be seen here. The persons here mentioned, of whom the majority saw me paint the work, confirm that this is as true a resemblance as art can render of something so admirable and extraordinary.""The picture differs fundamentally from all of Louis de Silvestre's other works. It strikes the viewer as disturbingly modern, and seems to be a mystery both in compositional terms and as regards the intensity of the colours. Only with an explanation of why the painting was done, as is related in the inscription on the large painting, and the knowledge that the artist was inspired to paint the picture by the actual sight of such a cloud formation, can the viewer understand why the work seems to flaunt all artistic convention"

17799-703goya.jpg	The mark 'X23' at the bottom of the canvas identifies this as a painting listed in 1812 in the inventory of paintings in Goya's house allocated to his son Javier. It probably hung next to one or other of two versions of Majas on a Balcony that bears the number X24. The painting of Les Jeunes or the Young Ones (A Woman Reading a Letter), long thought to have been a pendant and later sharing the same history, was possibly intended as such, although painted a year or two later.Exceptional in its way as a life-size Capricho, the scale makes the satirical purport the more forceful. But though the general meaning is clear - the ridiculing of the pretentiousness and vanity of the rich and old and ugly - the exact message 'Que tal?' ('How goes it?') on the back of the mirror is not spelt out. A similar theme, without the figure of Time, which is the subject of Plate 55 of Los Caprichos, has lent itself to interpretation as a reference to the Dowager Duchess of Osuna, and also to Queen Mar�a Luisa, renowned for her vanity and her ugliness. In support of such an allusion, though the Queen had long since left Spain when this painting was made, one of these old women wears a diamond arrow similar to that worn by Mar�a Luisa in the group portrait of Charles IV and his Family.Goya's son was no doubt referring to this and other paintings that Goya owned in 1812 when he wrote in one of his biographies of his father that Goya was specially interested in the paintings in his house 'because they were made with all the liberty that ownership affords; a liberty which led him in some cases to use the palette knife instead of the brush...and he particularly enjoyed seeing them every day'

23326-4barbar.jpg	"The iconographic program of the north wall, uninterrupted by door or windows is more complex and embraces two distinct themes. The centre of the wall is dominated by the huge figure of Christ as the Vine, a literal representation of Christ's words in John 15:5: ""I am the vine, ye are the branches."" The figure of Christ, with the praying figures of Battista Suardi, his wife, and sister at his feet is presented as the trunk of the vine, and the branches sprout out of his upturned fingers. The branches then curl into circles, forming natural counterparts to the roundels on the south and west walls, and likewise containing half-length figures, this time of saints. Sprouting leaves and bunches of grapes, the branches extend into the gable of the west wall and across the ceiling to form a fictive bower, filled with clambering putti. At either side of the composition are ladders placed against the branches of the vine, and two groups of early Christian heretics, duly labeled with their names, are attempting to climb to join the Elect. But two of the church fathers, Jerome and Ambrose, resist their advance and send them tumbling down beyond the confines of the fresco into an unseen pit of perdition.The second theme of the north wall, portrayed on a much smaller scale in the background and middle-ground landscape and buildings, concerns the life of St Barbara, cotitular with St Brigid of the oratory. The story is taken from the Golden Legend, and like so many of the saints' lives retold in this popular compendium, it concerns  the many trials and tribulations courageously suffered in Christ's name by one of his martyrs. It begins at the far left, where Barbara, recognizable by her blue dress and yellow cloak, is imprisoned in a tower by her pagan father. The story then unfolds from left to right, following a meandering course as Barbara is chased into the fields, arrested, forced to undergo a succession of cruel tortures, and finally beheaded. In one of the last episodes Barbara's father, the chief author of her persecution, is struck dead by a thunderbolt, a reminder that one of Barbara's most characteristic powers was to defend her devotees and their possessions from unexpected catastrophe"

09239-augustin.jpg	Coello, of Portuguese origin, became a leading exponent of Baroque painting in 17th century Madrid, having assimilated the influence of Carre&#241;o and Flemish painting. He marks the end of the school of Madrid of this century. He was a pupil of Francesco Ricci and an artist with an extraordinary gift for veristic representation. Coello's Baroque complexity, however, is combined with a naturalistic interest in detail that sometimes detracts from the formal hierarchy of his composition. A remarkable portraitist, he has bequeathed a number of pictures of Charles II in which the degeneracy of the last of the Hapsburgs is reflected without the least attempt at mitigation.Typical in this large work is the diagonal axis of the figures, stressing the dynamic movement of the saint, and the framing elements of classical architecture. The sensual and sumptuous colour recalls Rubens, whose pictures in the Royal Collection Coello is known to have studied

41110-11stscos.jpg	In the mid-15th century German painting, marked by the realist trend which had developed from the turn of the century onwards in the work of such artists as Konrad Witz and Stefan Lochner, saw a major evolution which was partly influenced by Flemish painting. This is evident in the present work.Against a traditional and by now old-fashioned gold background are outlined the figures of the three doctor saints, painted with great precision and in great detail. The artist has thereby clearly endeavoured to individualize each figure's face. The panel also incorporates a wide variety of different objects, connected with the saints' profession, as well as clothes and ornaments, all beautifully painted.The painting is a good example of the progress of German art towards realism and the representation of three-dimensional form. By using the now standard oil technique, the artist has been able to create volumes and represent the different textures of the objects

40236-rovere_1.jpg	The Roverella Polyptych is considered as one of Tura's most important work. Originally it was located in the church of San Giorgio fuori le Mura in Ferrara where it was partially destroyed by a bomb in 1709. It was commissioned by Lorenzo Roverella, bishop of Ferrara, earlier the physician of Pope Julius V. Lorenzo Roverella was pictured on the left (destroyed) part of the altarpiece.According to the most accepted version of reconstruction the Madonna Enthroned constituted the central panel, a fragment showing St George belonged to the left panel, while on the right a panel representing Niccol&#242; Roverella, the brother of the bishop and general of the monastery to which the church belonged, with two saints was located. On top of the altarpiece there was a Piet&#224;. Below, on the predella there were seven circular scenes illustrating the early life of Christ. Four of these scenes are lost.On the central panel the Madonna is sitting among angels playing on musical instruments. The restoration in 1951-52 found an inscription on the case of the organ, mentioned by contemporary sources, containing a dedication to Roverella in Latin

33601-06group.jpg	"Catalogue number: Bredius 410.Probably Rembrandt's most famous and most controversial painting was given its erroneous title the Night Watch in the early 19th century. The title referred to the subdued lighting and led art critics to seek all manner of hidden mysteries in the painting. The original title, recorded in the still extant family chronicle of Captain Banning Cocq, together with a sketch of the painting, sounds rather dry by comparison: ""Sketch of the painting from the Great Hall of Cleveniers Doelen, in which the young Heer van Purmerlandt [Banning Cocq], as captain, orders his lieutenant, the Heer van Vlaerderdingen [Willem van Ruytenburch], to march the company out.""It is, therefore, a ""Doelen"" piece or group portrait in which the captain can be seen in the foreground wearing black and the lieutenant wearing yellow. What sets Rembrandt's group portrait apart from other comparable paintings is his use of chiaroscuro as a dramatic device. Interpretations seeking a plausible action fail to take into account that the scenery is made up more or less of individual ""types"". The painting includes the entire repertoire of portrait poses and gestures from Rembrandt's store of figures.There is inevitably a sense of celebration in the portrayal of individuals in a Dutch group painting. Yet whereas Frans Hals, for example, draws together his individual participants around a banquet scene, Rembrandt breaks up the group, so that individual characters and participants become absorbed in their own actions, each standing alone"

21939-3virg_l.jpg	There are two versions of the Virgin of the Rocks, one (the earlier) in the Louvre, Paris and another in the National Gallery, London.This version of the painting for the ancona (a carved wooden altar with frames where paintings were inserted) in the chapel of the Immacolata in the church of San Francesco Grande in Milan has distinctly sixteenth-century characteristics: larger figures, made more plastic by a very decided chiaroscuro so unlike Leonardo that scholars were immediately led to consider the work a collaboration. The canvas is generally considered the one that replaced the first version of the Virgin of the Rocks on the altar of the Immaculate Conception, after that version had been given to Louis XII. This version was then, in 1785, purchased by the English collector Gavin Hamilton. It was joined, in England, in 1898, by the two musician-angels of the De Predis brothers, and the three paintings are now displayed together in London's National Gallery.The picture substitutes a motif popular in Florence for the image normally required by Franciscan patrons promoting the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception: a Virgin without the Child, shown standing among prophets holding texts taken to refer to her exemption from Original Sin. In the Virgin of the Rocks the infant Baptist, sheltering under Mary's cloak, venerates the Christ Child in a cool, watery wilderness. The artist's Milanese clients must have worried about confusing the two infants, for a later hand has given John an identifying scroll and a cross clumsily rooted in one of Leonardo's exquisite studies of plants.The panel was inserted into a pre-existing frame, elaborately decorated with carving, gilding and painted shutters. (The two musical angels shown nearby, executed by an associate, probably come from the front and back of the right-hand shutter.) In the candlelit chapel the glittering frame and the painted rocks from whose shadows the figures emerge would have combined to suggest a mysterious cavern. In his notebooks Leonardo records a moment, when standing before the mouth of a cave, `Suddenly two things arose in me...fear of the menacing darkness... [and] desire to see if there was any marvellous thing within.' The contrast between the unfinished areas of the picture - such as the hand of the angel on Christ's back - and the finished passages would not have been as disturbing as it is now. Leonardo's intentions in this deeply emotional yet strangely uncommunicative work were perhaps most fully carried out in the angel's head and diaphanous veil, where the shimmering brushstrokes are of miraculous firmness and delicacy.The London version shows some details generally neglected by Leonardo in the other version: the haloes of the figures, the child Saint John's cross of reeds. Other elements which differ from the Paris picture are the pose of the angel, who no longer points his finger towards the little Paraclete, and his face, whose gaze no longer seeks out the spectator, but is directed inwards. The drapery, too, which in the Paris version was heavy and concealed the body, is lighter here, revealing the anatomical structure. Also the rocks seem painted in a more plastic fashion; the light does not glide over them, creating dewy areas of semi-darkness, but leaves strong contrasts of light and dark. The flesh of the children here is less tender, and though the shadows are insistent, the children's faces seem flatter and less sweet than those of the two sublime creatures in Paris. The intervention of followers on the painting already sketched by Leonardo has made the portrayal less vibrant, more banal, though it retains a compositional authority and an originality in its variants that make this work not a copy but an autonomous version, of high quality, of the unequalled masterpiece in the Louvre

12501-13sebast.jpg	This primitive portrait has been partially repainted and transformed into a Saint Sebastian with a large halo. Originally, the man wore a beret and held a broken arrow in his left hand, which rests on the window sill, as you can still see today. In the whole painting, only the landscape passage with the lake and the castle in front of the mountains have remained in its original state. The arrow is a fairly rare attribute for a portrait, although, in this case, it could become credible if Sebastian Imhoff were the person portrayed, as Thode had previously proposed when the painting was first published in 1893. Sebastian Imhoff was elected to the position of consul of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi in Venice in 1493.The painting shows many D�rerian portrait characteristics of this era, such as the landscape beyond the window and the resting of the hands in the window sill; the minimum of space between the window sill and the back wall; and the curtain that partially covers it

20319-wilmot.jpg	John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester (1647-1680), was an English poet and courtier of King Charles II's Restoration court. He helped establish English satiric poetry.The composition of this portrait, almost certainly of Rochester's own devising, reflects a typical conceit found in his writing. A light-hearted quip suggestive of the self-depreciation of the man himself, it also carries a deeper message, serving to highlight the perfidy and vanity of man. It portrays Rochester, manuscript in hand and resplendent in silk, bestowing the poet's laurels on a jabbering monkey which tears the pages from a book and hands them back, crumpled, to the poet. Monkeys feature prominently in Rochester's writing, along with other animal metaphors, serving to point up the folly and presumption of man.This spectacular portrait was part of the collection of portraits formed by the 2nd Earl of Warwick, at Warwick Castle in the late eighteenth century. For many years, it has been on loan in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, since the late 1970s

34177-sfrancis.jpg	After about 1612, Ribalta's art begins to reflect the heightened, anguished spirituality of the city, but it was not until a visit to Madrid around 1619&#151;20 that he found the way to channel the religious fervour into great works of art. In Madrid, Ribalta experienced the Florentine naturalism of the Carducho brothers. (It is also possible that Pedro Orrente played a part in directing Ribalta toward a greater naturalism.) Indeed, his St Francis Comforted by a Musical Angel, painted around 1620 for an altar in the church of the Capuchinos of Valencia, is a direct descendant of Bartolome Carducho's Death of St Francis. This painting is purged of all vestiges of mannerism and uses the powerful force of light to enhance the presence of figures and objects alike. It also displays a new fluidity and confidence in composition and draftsmanship: the angel, dramatically framed by fluttering drapery, points the lute like a crossbow at the recoiling body of the saint, who is startled by the heavenly intruder.

42975-1honour.jpg	This tondo belongs to a series of 21 such circular pictures adorning the ceiling of the great room of the Libreria Vecchia.Even Vasari, who interpreted the ruler on the throne as the personification of Honour, got no further in 1568 than a mere description of this enigmatic scene. The rulers throne is decorated on each side by small, carved figures. The one on his left holds a sceptre, the tip of which forms an eye. Various figures present themselves in front of the throne, including a woman with a child (Caritas?), a kneeling figure bearing an animal sacrifice and a bearded old man with a crown woven of laurel boughs. A comparison of the tondi in the Biblioteca Marciana shows that Veronese supplied works of very differing approaches and quality. The harmoniously grouped figures in Music translate the dramatic pictorial resources of the ceiling paintings of San Sebastiano into a calm, classic style. In contrast, the two figures with their backs turned to us in Honour resound with Mannerist echoes. Veronese here applies Tintoretto's principle of divergence to the arrangement of moving figures

38207-river_la.jpg	This painting, depicting an extensive river landscape with a boeier at anchor and horsemen on the shore with an elegant couple and a dog, a ferry with cows in the background, formed part of a rare set of six wall-hangings by the brothers Jacob and Abraham van Strij.

05023-henri_3.jpg	Bonington was Anglo-French; born in Nottingham, he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and went on to exert a considerable influence on the course of French Romantic painting. Delacroix, a great admirer of his work and a close friend, once sketched with him in London, and after this visit they had briefly shared a Paris studio. Both Bonington and Delacroix had cultivated subjects from past history which they reconstructed with a romantic attention to sentimental detail and character. They were avid readers of Scott, Byron, Shakespeare and of less well remembered authors like Dumesnil, from whom Bonington took the subject of his Henri III.This painting is a study of the foppish character of the last Valois king of France, revealing Bonington's great affection for history and romance; he found the subject in a novel by Dumesnil published in 1825

09862-courb202.jpg	Courbet's favourite subject in the 1840s seems to have been the self-portrait. This relatively unusual genre requires the artist to observe his own reflection, demanding remarkable stillness and concentration. Traveling to Belgium and the Netherlands for the first time in the summer of 1846, Courbet went to The Hague to admire the Rembrandt self-portraits. But unlike Rembrandt, Courbet liked to dress up and stage his own appearance. The series of self-portraits that Courbet painted between 1842 and 1849 is clearly Romantic in inspiration and the source of a very personal and modern interpretation of the myth of the artist in the nineteenth century

23925-coastal.jpg	This painting, depicting a coastal landscape with a ship and figures on the shore, is a characteristic work by the French marine painter Adrien Manglard. Manglard is principally known to us today as a painter of marines and landscapes, though the sources clearly inform us that he also executed a large number of religious works. The principal subject of his marines, and indeed of the present work, is the sea itself: the figures are marginalised, the landscape merely acts as a backdrop or framing element, and the ship being tossed on choppy seas is moved to the far left of the composition

04698-05devil.jpg	At first sight the picture seems full of mystery, indeed it creates a sense of unease. The very title seems designed to evoke a shudder, and this impression is strengthened by the darkening evening with its long shadows, and above all, the building crane, which looks like a gallows. The viewer may well be attracted to the Romantic mood of the painting, but the true message is clear, and it is rather sombre. Man is bringing even the most distant and seemingly inaccessible regions under control through civilization and technical advance, and he is mastering the aspects of nature that have till now seemed unapproachable and fearful. But there is also allegory here - it is in the reference to transience. The new bridge that is being built will one day be as crumbling as the old one is now.

33568-097portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 120.Titus van Rijn was born in 1641 and was the only child of Rembrandt and Saskia van Uylenburgh to survive into adulthood. Saskia died in the year after his birth and Titus was entrusted to the care of, firstly, Geertge Dircx and then Hendrickje Stoffels. After Rembrandt's bankruptcy, Hendrickje and Titus set up an art-dealing business in order to provide Rembrandt with protection against his creditors. Titus was trained by his father as a painter but hardly any trace of his artistic activities survive. After Hendrickje's death in 1663 Titus continued the art-dealing business. He married in 1668 but died in the same year, twelve months before his father.Titus's features appear in a number of paintings by Rembrandt. He showed him in the habit of a monk (Rijksmuseum), seated reading (Vienna) and wearing an elegant costume, beret and gold chain (Wallace Collection). Here he is seen as a schoolboy, seated at his desk, day-dreaming over his homework. In his right hand is his quill pen and his penholder and inkpot are in his left. The portrait is painted very freely - the boy's arms and his papers are indicated by no more than single brushstrokes - and on the desk can be seen the broad marks of Rembrandt's palette knife.What is slightly curious about the present picture is that Titus appears to be represented as a younger boy than he actually was. Shown seated, or perhaps standing, at a desk and puzzling over his homework, he has the large eyes, rounded cheeks and small mouth of a child of eight or nine, rather than those of a boy of his true age, which was fourteen

07960-farnes04.jpg	The huge ceiling in the reception room of Palazzo Farnese, painted just as the seventeenth century was beginning, was part of a great cycle of decorative paintings on the theme The Loves of the Gods, which Carracci painted for Cardinal Odoardo Farnese. They are his undoubted masterpieces and were tremendously influential, for two centuries ranking with Michelangelo's work in the Sistine Chapel and Raphael's frescos in the Vatican as the supreme examples of Western painting. Generations of young painters were set to copy it.During the protracted period it took to complete the frescos, the Palazzo Farnese cycle became a test bed for the Carraccis' revitalized classicism. Annibale Carracci transformed the reception room into a shining collection of classical pictures. In fact, the decoration was not intended to be a single scene, but imitated a collection of framed paintings surrounding the main scene. This was the Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne which fills the centre of the ceiling. The individual pictures are painted with a smiling, serene sense of classical antiquity revisited and reinterpreted through the art of Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian and Correggio. Many of the separate currents that had flowed through the Renaissance came together here. They gave life to a new sort of art which was characterized by the supremacy of resplendent and light-hearted decoration, filled with colour and movement

34102-4renoi19.jpg	After 1900 Renoir mainly lived in the south of France. Shortly before his death - by then the nearly 80-year-old artist was crippled in a wheelchair and had to have his paintbrush tied to his twisted arthritic fingers - Renoir devoted himself to a series of composition with nude bathers.His markedly violent method of painting conflicts with the physical condition of the artist. The large painting which shows two voluminous women reclining at leisure in a lush landscape has the effect of an improvisation placed directly onto the canvas. Over the long years of his career as an artist Renoir had created an extensive repertoire of female nudes and poses which he was able to call upon quite easily, now that he was painting the Bathers. By using thinly applied colours he endowed his nudes with a liveliness which turns them into embodiments of sheer vitality

08956-roemer.jpg	It is worth noting that in this monochrome 'banketje', which is dominated by shades of grey, green and silver, the elements of the painting have been reduced to a small number of vessels. Thus the composition of the painting is determined by an overturned silver goblet, a half empty wine glass and two pewter plates. Although this is a so-called breakfast still-life (an onbijtje), hardly any food is shown, but only the sparse left-overs of a meal, such as the olive on the plate, where it forms some kind of optical barrier between the hollow foot of the goblet and the plate that reflects it. Unlike the overabundance of food in earlier Flemish still-lifes, this painting emphasizes a refinement of taste. Naive consumerism has been replaced by aesthetic sublimation under the influence of Protestant introspection and asceticism

12385-wmilking.jpg	"The present painting marks the start of a new period in Dujardin's art, when he moved on from Italianate landscapes that bore the influence of Nicolaes Berchem to scenes inspired by Paulus Potter. Magisterially executed animals came increasingly to the fore, as did monumental human figures.The duet of a milkmaid and a shepherd boy has a long pictorial tradition, stretching back at least to an engraving of 1510 by Lucas van Leyden. The subject is rendered by Dujardin as a simple evocation of everyday events. There is no communication between the characters. The cow, depicted almost portrait-like, the dog on the left, and the goat and sheep in the background, all share equal ranking with the human figures.The bare soles revealed by the young girl as she kneels with her back to the viewer are conspicuously dirty. This motif can be related to the scandal of a few decades earlier provoked by Caravaggio's Madonna of Loreto in the church of Sant'Agostino, Rome. Dujardin, however, used this ""pittoresque"" (rather than crudely naturalistic) detail not in an altarpiece but in a profane scene"

07252-canal702.jpg	This very bold composition, with a view of the Thames framed by an arch of the bridge, influenced the work of a number of native English artists. It may have been inspired by a print by Piranesi, published in the early 1740s.The arch has been used carefully so that it does not flatten the image. It is placed just off centre, looked through at a slight angle, and the uniformity of its shape is broken by the simple device of a bucket being lowered on a rope. It acts like a giant eye or lens and focuses attention on the cityscape beyond, which includes the Water Tower and York Water Gate at the left, and St Paul's Cathedral at the right. In the centre can be seen the spire of the church of St Clement Danes. The delicate peach coloration of the clouds above, suggests this is a rare instance of Canaletto attempting to depict dusk.The painting is thought to have been commissioned by Sir Hugh Smithson, who was to become the Duke of Northumberland. He was one of those responsible for overseeing the construction of the new bridge

In that year he painted the Plague of Ashdod (Louvre, Paris), which sets the style and mood of his work for the next five years. The following year he painted the Empire of Flora, a more cheerful subject but with a similarly interlocking frieze of figures. It is round these two pictures, datable through documents, that the rest of Poussin's pictures supposedly painted around 1630 have to be grouped.This is one of the earliest paintings executed by Poussin in Rome.

Steen made the point, a common motif of comedies, by giving the doctor an outmoded, perhaps theatrical costume, by letting the boy Cupid smile knowingly at the viewer, and by inserting a famous comic painting, Frans Hals's Jester Pickle-Herring at top right..

42894-1view1.jpg	"Painted Corinthian columns and ""arcades"", presumably carried out by Veronese's brother and assistant Benedetto Caliari, form a light architectural framework for the extraordinarily delightful trompe l'oeil landscapes with small figures and classical buildings. A continuous plaster cornice provides an upper edge and three-dimensional wall articulation, and was - like the door frames - presumably done to a design by the painter. In 1648, Veronese's biographer Carlo Ridolfi was the first to identify the musicians as muses. A pair of them flanked each of the illusory doors in the ""transept"" vestibules through which visitors appear to enter the room. The final elements of the decoration are the grisaille equestrian scenes below, which are in the style of cameos"

In keeping with the tradition of history painting, in the studio he recomposed views from the open-air studies and animated them with figures sketched on his outings or during sittings. In the 1840s, Corot sought to transform the ""impressions"" captured during his outdoor work into full-fledged landscapes, which he steeped in a sentimental, poetic mood. In this way he invented the idea of ""souvenir"".
