09240-charles2.jpg	One of the most important tasks of a court painter in the age of absolutism was portraiture, either in the form of an individual, family or group portrait. Most of these commissioned works were sent to other royal houses. Whatever the occasion in each respective case, a portrait of this kind invariably had the primary function of representing the court.Coello's unfinished portrait of King Charles II gives us an opportunity of seeing how the artist worked. The three-quarter profile of the young king is set in a medallion. Coello has concentrated on depicting the brilliance of the shining armour and the rich folds of the bow, using free and spontaneous brush-strokes. Reproductions of a portrait of Charles II from the St&#228;del in Frankfurt, lost in 1945, suggests that Coello toned down these lavish details somewhat in a later version. In comparison to paintings of Alsonso S�nchez Coello, who had worked for the Spanish court a hundred years earlier, Claudio Coello's view of the monarch has little of the stringency of courtly ceremony. He is the last major representative of the Spanish tradition of painting that reached its climax in the Mannerism of the 16th century

24860-charles.jpg	There is a dignity in this portrait, in which intense shades of red predominate, which makes it the worthy representation of a cardinal and 'Prince of the Church'. His face reflects the devotion and concentration appropriate to the act of prayer, combined, however, with the authority of worldly knowledge and political skill. It was not for nothing that Louis XI of France invited him to act as his son's godfather, or helped him to become Archbishop of Lyons; indeed he spared no effort to gain the support of the Bourbons, one of the country's greatest noble families, to which the Cardinal belonged.

20889-port_wom.jpg	Signed at left: Angelica Kauffmann. Pinx: Romae a&#176; 1795.Angelica Kauffmann was one of the most celebrated artists of her time, winning high praise from Goethe (whose portrait she painted), Herder and other literary figures. Her popularity was not entirely due to the fact that by the end of the eighteenth century women had been to some extent emancipated by the Enlightenment, for her surviving pictures, particularly her portraits, show that she was an exceptionally gifted artist who consistently and effectively expressed in her works the approach of the new era of Neoclassicism. Most of her historical compositions are based on classical and literary themes, while her portraits are characterized by lucidity of form, noble poses and cool, limpid colours.This portrait of a middle-aged woman in front of her dressing-table was for many years believed to be a self-portrait, but comparison with authentic self-portraits disproves this. The inscription tells us that the portrait was painted in Rome in 1795, so it is more likely to have been a likeness of Princess Esterh�zy, for whom Angelica Kauffmann is known to have worked at that time

39154-18zianig.jpg	The scene showing Rinaldo leaving the garden of Armida, taken from Gerusalemme Liberata by Torquato Tasso, was originally on the ground floor of the Zianigo villa. Inspired by a similar painting by his father, it is marked by an almost caricature style, already emptied of the heroic-mythical allure of Giovanni Battista's work. The theme is thus heroic and sentimental, exactly like Tasso's poem and many of Giovanni Battista's figures. But the impassioned and melancholy atmosphere of the episode is already breaking up, revealing that Giandomenico is doffing his hat as illustrator of poems to replace it with that of the comedian.

13272-lycurgus.jpg	The painting illustrates an anecdote by Plutarch about the Spartan king Lycurgus. Seated in the market place, the king addressed the crowd assembled around him on the importance of a proper upbringing. He called his two dogs to demonstrate his point and placed before them a bowl of food and a live hare. One chased after the hare, but the other stopped to eat from the bowl. Lycurgus then explained to the mystified onlookers: 'These two dogs came from the same litter but they were raised in different ways. One has turned into glutton and the other a spirited hunting dog.' Lycurgus had trained one for the hunt and allowed the other to go its own way. The latter is the animal licking the pot in the foreground, while the hunting dog stands beside Lycurgus and receives an approving pat on the head. The hare it has caught lies on the step at Lycurgus' feet.At the time, the parable was cited in numerous tracts on education. In Everdingen's painting the scene is crystal clear and every detail is rendered with meticulous precision. And yet there is something unreal about it. It begs comparison with a 'tableau vivant' or a set of wax statues

20730-dianacte.jpg	In the years around 1640, the successful Antwerp artist Jordaens painted a number of works with mythological scenes that differed strongly from his previous production, both in terms of dimensions and the relationship between figures and landscapes. The present work uses the Antwerp cabinet-painting format, a comparatively small size of picture for Jordaens that follows in the tradition of Frans Francken II, Hendrick van Balen and Jan Brueghel the Elder. Diana and Actaeon is the first example in Jordaens's oeuvre in which landscape came to assume an importance of its own, becoming as significant in the painting as the historical scene with its small-scale, almost incidental figures. This painting must be seen as one of the most important examples of this group.Fully in keeping with Ovid (Metamorphoses, III, 138-252), the hunter, who is on the left, carrying a spear and followed by his dogs, is dressed to great effect in a length of red cloth. Separated by no more than a narrow stretch of water flowing along the lower edge of the painting we see the naked figures of Diana and her companions, almost in a direct line before the hunter and seemingly lined up for the viewer. The blatant nudity of these delightful, voluptuous women departs strangely from Ovid's descriptions, in which, upon their discovery by Actaeon, the surprised nymphs try to cover and hide themselves.In Jordaens's composition, Diana and her companions seem to have frozen somewhat half-heartedly into droll poses; after all, the depiction of the undraped female body was the major reason for the artist's choice of this subject. So Jordaens makes the most of his opportunity, and depicts the women caught performing their post-hunt ablutions in ten different positions, some curiously bent, some standing, and some crouching. With this group Jordaens demonstrates his prowess in painting the nude

On the walls below, a cycle with scenes from the lives of the archdeacons Stephen and Lawrence, by Il Vecchietta and Paolo Schiavo can be seen.The six scene from the life of the Virgin fill the six compartments of the cross-ribbed vaulting of the polygonal presbytery, their unusual arrangement dictated in part by the relative sizes of the available spaces. Owing to their larger numbers of figures, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Kings were relegated to the wider side compartments. The three narrower compartments between them were utilized for the glorification of the Virgin, in them we find the Coronation placed between the Annunciation and the Betrothal. The Assumption scene appears in the compartment directly behind the choir arch, and is not visible from the nave of the church. On the capstone God the Father giving benediction is depicted

36565-charity.jpg	This painting holds a historic place in the Farnese collection. It is also one of Schedoni's best-known works. The rather generic title is not really sufficient as the canvas appears to be describing a real episode. Schedoni gave his characters an amazing degree of consistency and peremptoriness. The blind boy staring out at us with empty eyes is one of the strongest images ever produced in the seventeenth century. As always, Schedoni also drew on Correggio's legacy for touches of moving lyricism, such as the little boy on the right. But the real magic of the painting lies yet again in the highly personal way that Schedoni used light, both penetrating and delicate at the same time. His light brings out the coloured fabrics while casting long shadows over parts of the faces

34637-laokoon.jpg	Laoco�n is an antique marble group (Vatican Museum) representing the Trojan priest Laoco�n and his two sons being crushed to death by serpents as a penalty for warning the Trojans against the wooden horse of the Greeks, an incident related by Virgil in the Aeneid. It is usually dated to the 2nd or 1st century BC or the 1st century AD, although whether it is an original Hellenistic piece or a Roman copy has long been a matter of dispute. Pliny states that in his time it stood in the palace of the Emperor Titus in Rome and records that it was made by the sculptors Hagesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus of Rhodes.The sculpture had disappeared, and its rediscovery in a vineyard in Rome in 1506 made an overwhelming impression, notably on Michelangelo, who went to see it immediately.

06005-lycomede.jpg	The subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Knowing her son was destined to die if he went to fight in the Trojan war, Thethis, a sea nymph, disguised Achilles as a woman and entrusted him to King Lycomedes, in whose palace on the isle of Scyros he lived among the king's daughters. Odysseus and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch Achilles. They cunningly laid a heap of gifts before the girls - jewellery, clothes and other finery, but among them a sword, spear and shield. When a trumpet was sounded, Achilles instinctively snatched up the weapons and thus betrayed his identity.In the painting, Odysseus stands in the archway on the left. He has a band slung over his shoulders to support the basket containing Achilles's helmet. Achilles, disguised as a woman, stands on the right, behind a large, decorated chest draped with a costly Oriental carpet. He clasps the hilt of the sword in his right hand and rest the tip of the blade on his left hand. The other characters look on in astonishment. The elegant woman in the foreground offers him a string of pearls from the finely decorated jewellery box in an attempt to cover up his error.The austere composition, with prominent architecture and figures like statues, give the picture the appearance of a classical theatre performance

19159-44broeck.jpg	In this portrait there is a perfect match of a painter's style to the sitter. Hals's bold, direct manner is ideally suited to portrayal of the Antwerp-born colonial trader Pieter van den Broecke (1585-1640) who lived in Haarlem. He was first active as a merchant in West Africa and subsequently served the Dutch East India Company in Java, Arabia, Persia and India. In 1630 he brought back to the Netherlands an important fleet from India and was rewarded by the Dutch East India Company for his seventeen years of service with a gold chain worth 1200 guilders. It is this chain which he proudly wears in the portrait.In 1634 van den Broecke published an account of his exotic career which presents a purposeful and straightforward man who was typical of the aggressive entrepreneurs who shaped the Dutch commercial empire. This portrait, with its thrusting and confident pose, gives a similar impression and it is not surprising to find that it was used, in the form of an engraving by Adriaen Matham, as the frontispiece of van den Broecke's book. Van den Broecke knew Frans Hals well, acting as a witness at the baptism of Hals's daughter, Susanna, in 1634. The second witness was one Adriaen Jacobsz., almost certainly the Adriaen Matham who engraved the portrait for van den Broecke's autobiography

22650-10panel2.jpg	An orphan placed in the friary as a child, Fra Filippo Lippi took his vows at Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence in 1421, in time to observe Masaccio and Masolino at work on the famous frescoes there. He was more suited to the life of a painter than to that of a Carmelite, for in 1456, while chaplain to a convent in Prato, he induced a nun to elope with him. She was to bear him a child, Filippino, who grew up to be an excellent painter of outstandingly chaste morals. Filippo was employed as an artist by the Medici, and through their intercession obtained a special dispensation to marry Filippino's mother.The pair of panels, the Annunciation and the Seven Saints were originally from a Medici palace in Florence. The shape and subject matter of both panels suggest that they were part of the furnishings of two separate but related rooms, either as bed heads or as panels situated above a bed or door. While the seven saints illustrates a dynastic theme through the male member of the family, the Annunciation would have been more suitable for a woman's room

12502-1self28.jpg	"The last of D�rer's three magnificent self-portraits was painted early in 1500, before his 29th birthday on 21 May. The picture is proudly inscribed: `Thus I, Albrecht D�rer from Nuremburg, painted myself with indelible colours at the age of 28 years.' It is a sombre image, painted primarily in browns, set against a plain dark background.The face is striking for its resemblance to the head of Christ. In late medieval art, Jesus was traditionally presented in this manner, looking straight ahead in a symmetrical pose. Christ's brown hair in these images is parted towards the middle and falls over the shoulders. For the first and last time in Western art history, an artist was to portray himself in a Christ-like scheme. Given his idealized appearance as the underdrawing shows, his nose was originally irregular in shape - D�rer is approaching us in ""imitatio Christi"", in imitation of Christ. He has a short beard and moustache. D�rer has even painted himself with brown hair, although the other self-portraits show that it was actually reddish-blond. D�rer deliberately set out to create a Christ-like image, with his hand raised to his chest almost in a pose of blessing. But this was no gesture of arrogance or blasphemy. It was a statement of faith: Christ was the son of God and God had created Man. For D�rer, the painting was an acknowledgment that artistic skills were a God-given talent.However, D�rer has subtly departed from the traditional image of Christ in his self-portrait. Despite initial appearances, the picture is not quite symmetrical. The head lies just off the centre of the panel to the right and the parting of the hair is not exactly in the middle, with the strands of hair falling a little differently on the two sides. The eyes stare slightly towards the left of the panel. D�rer also wears contemporary clothing, a fashionable fur-lined mantle. The result is a highly personal image, one whose `indelible colours' still influence the way we imagine D�rer looked in his later years.The deceptive illusionism in which the picture is painted is also, however, a reference to the classical artistic legend about Apelles, with whom he had been compared by contemporary humanists"

02724-assumary.jpg	The rather flat ceiling is decorated by a painted, illusionistic architecture. The architectural details are painted in extreme foreshortening.Above the oval main room of the monastery church, a broad concave moulding marks the transition to a domed ceiling. The vaulting opens up into a diadem borne by angels, reiterating the oval ground-plan. Illuminated by invisible windows, we see the saints of the Benedictine order in all the glory of the heavens.It is quite impossible for the spectator to see that this domed setting is actually flat, and that the whole work is not, as is so often claimed, a domed ceiling fresco. By creating a transition from oval to circle, Asam is able to interweave the clouds amongst the pillars so that they help to conceal the base of the (painted) round temple on the oval ceiling aperture. A more intense metaphor for the heavens as a domed and pillared temple borne on clouds can hardly be imagined.On the main side of the fresco we see St George with his eyes raised towards Mary as she is carried upwards to Christ and God, who is holding a crown above the starry nimbus around her head. It is the triumph of the church that is displayed here against the golden background bathed in light, and its effect is all the more overwhelming because Asam has made the architecture his accomplice in illusion

11554-landbrid.jpg	Antonio Diziani, born in Venice in 1737, was the son and pupil of the famous Gaspare Diziani. He was mainly active as a painter of landscapes in and around Venice. In 1774 he was elected a member of the Painting and Sculpture Academy in Venice. His landscapes show the influence of Marco Ricci in both composition and colouring as well as technique; like Ricci he often executed gouaches. A large collection of these works can today be found in the Galleria dell'Accademia in Venice and in the Museo Civico in Padua. Antonio Diziani also collaborated with his father as is evident in the green tonalities of the frescoes in Villa Barbini in Caselle d'Asolo. His last activity is noted in 1797 in Venice

17560-18portra.jpg	"Gossart painted many portraits. By their rigorous psychological analysis he is surely one of the most talented northern artists to have practiced this genre. Usually, he would paint his sitters against a dark green background.Several possibilities have been suggested for the sitter's identity: Baudouin of Burgundy, Adolf of Burgundy, who had succeeded Philip of Burgundy (bastard son of Duke Philip the Good) as admiral in Zeeland, and Charles of Burgundy (1491- 1538). The latter proposal has found increasing acceptance.The sitter's cool gaze contrasts with the swirl of emblematic valuables surrounding his codpiece, which is accentuated by the gentleman's gesturing hands. These objects include a ring, short sword with a pommel, keys, and a dagger inscribed ""AUTRE QUE VOUS JE N'AIME"" (I love you only)- an efficient motto for Duke Philip the Good, who enjoyed countless lovers and left innumerable bastard, including Adolf and his half-brother Philip, who had the chateau at Souburg, where Gossart worked for a time.

18476-innoceny.jpg	Like many painters, Greuze had produced studies of individual heads as drawings and in oil from early in his career. Some of them were nature studies, others specifically prepared figures in his larger narrative paintings. From the late 1770s, these 'expressive heads' developed into a separate genre, often erotically charged, and into a main field of his activities.

42625-28astro0.jpg	Signature: Signed and dated 668 on the cupboard (spurious, later additions).Provenance: This painting and the Geographer (St&#228;delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt) are probably companion pieces, in spite of the fact that the sitter is looking to the left in both of them. They share the same provenance until 1778. Thus: sale Rotterdam, 1713; sale Amsterdam, 1720; sale Amsterdam, 1729; sale Amsterdam, 1778. Collection Jean-Etienne Fiseau; art dealer Lebrun, Paris; brought to Paris in 1785; sale Amsterdam, 1797; sale Amsterdam, 1800; sale Paris, 1881; collection Alphonse de Rothschild, Paris, 1888; collection Edouard de Rothschild. Abducted by Hitler during World War II. Restored to owner in 1945. Acquired by Mus�e du Louvre, Paris, 1983.In view of the fact that the Astronomer and the Geographer are probably pendants, and are the only works in Vermeer's oeuvre that represent male figures involved in scholarly pursuits, we are treating them conjointly.Until 1778, they remained together. The signatures and dates on both paintings are questionable, but they must have been executed toward the end of the 1660s.None of these paintings appears in the sale of 1696, and were therefore commissioned by a patron who was especially interested in astronomy or the celestial sciences. In both paintings, the references to books, scientific instruments, and, in the portrait of the Astronomer, the celestial globe by Jodocus Hondius, are accurately depicted.The latter painting features on the rear wall a picture representing the scene of the finding of Moses, which has been interpreted as being associated with the advice of divine providence in reaching, in the case of the astronomer, for spiritual guidance.Although farfetched, it is likely that the content of the painting is associated in some way with the meaning of the work. The sea chart on the wall of the Geographer does not have any religious association. It must be remembered that the rise of interest in scientific research at the time, fostered by the newly established University of Leyden, and philosophers like Descartes, did not have any specific religious associations. Quite to the contrary, the aim was to explore the universe, and simultaneously to further Dutch navigation in its conquest of faraway lands.Both paintings, with their interiors of scholarly studios and scientific paraphernalia, award Vermeer the opportunity for lightening effects that envelop the scientists in the mystery of an atmosphere that lifts their occupations into the realm of spirituality

18413-2001grec.jpg	The great masterpiece of the late manner of the artist, painted for the High Altar of the Chapel of Oballe, San Vicente, Toledo, begun 1607, finished 1613. The painting certainly represents the Immaculate Conception, although it has often been referred to as an Assumption. The various attributes of the Virgin (roses, lilies, mirror, fountain of clear water) proper to the representation of the Mystery, appear at the foot of the painting on the right. A view of Toledo appears on the left. The spiritual excitement of the scene is reflected in meteorological effects: sun and moon shine simultaneously while explosions of light burst through the clouds like fire.El Greco took the distinctive characteristics of his late style to their extreme conclusion in this work. Ordered scale and proportion, spatial recession and anatomical accuracy have been subordinated to imperatives of visionary experience. Colours are unblended, forms have become dematerialised, the logic of gravity and shadows is subverted; the distinctions between near and far, open and enclosed, physical and spiritual, are all dissolved. At the same time, however, El Greco has included a passage of naturalistic still-life that seems to belong to the earthly realm - the roses and lilies at lower right, traditional emblems of the Virgin. Their inclusion intensifies the visual transition from the earthly to the mystical.The painting is the grand culmination of Greco's career. No artist has been able to express so convincingly the infinite: an infinity of colour and light, an infinity of movement and of space. This expression of the spiritual reality of the universe was only possible to attain by the uncompromising disengagement of his art from the material and transitory of this World. The earth, symbolized by Toledo, is already a phantom. From the burst of rose and white flowers at the base, a great upsurge of movement - of colour and light, in constant flux - commences, and increases in its rapture, and met by the light of the Dove, becomes all-pervading and infinite. It is perhaps the most remarkable realisation of spiritual ecstasy in painting, and one of the greatest masterpieces of colour. A single detail - the offering of flowers, the opening of a wing, the Virgin's mantle transfigured by light - is a moving experience in itself

32997-6logget1.jpg	After the decoration of the Loggia, Raphael's pupils later reaffirmed their interest in classical antiquity and its interpretation in the decoration of the Loggetta, a small porch adjacent to the Stufetta, or bath room, of Cardinal Bibbiena. The decorative program consisted of grotesque figures and of scenes from the Apollo myth. Only two of the three original paintings have been preserved. The scholar, Regid de Campos, reconstructed the third scene, whose theme was almost certainly the Flaying of Marsyas. The other two scenes represent Olympus praying to Apollo, and Apollo and Marsyas. Architectural structures, animals, winged cherubs and false niches containing reproductions of statues (which Regid de Campos has identified as the Seasons) - similar to those which appear in Roman wall paintings - accompany the three scenes. This refined decorative complex was the logical completion of the Logge and the last reflection of the classical tendencies of art at the court of Leo X

39183-16valmar.jpg	The flying Amor with arrows above a Veneto landscape was painted by Giovanni Domenico on the wall of the room of Homer. The flying Amor is hovering over a landscape enlivened with church towers, cypresses, and wayfarers, resembling the surroundings of the villa.In addition to the frescoes in the Foresteria, Giovanni Domenico also painted figural elements in the Palazzina, in part after his father's design, in part on his own.

30213-2evangel.jpg	The paintings in the old sacristy of the church, completed by Palma Giovane in May 1581, concentrate on the double aspect of the eucharistic mystery as defined by the Council of Trent: the sacrifice of the mass and of the sacrament. As a counter to ignorance and doubt, the paintings trace an illustrious history from the Old Testament, with episodes symbolically foretelling the eucharistic mystery in the Jewish Passover and the Crossing of the Red Sea, to the Gospels. The cycle revolves around the centre of the ceiling where the Eucharist is presented: a ciborium supported by four columns stands over an altar with the host in a monstrance in the form of the sun, surrounded by the four Evangelists			
43008-03lynx1.jpg	This  is one of the relatively few portrait painted by Veronese. The model of the painting is not identified.In its warm-colour tones, this portrait recalls the works of the Lombard painter Moretto da Brescia, while its structure is reminiscent of late 1540s portraits by Tintoretto, which Veronese certainly must have seen even before his first visit to Venice in 1551. The luxurious lynx fur visibly documents the prosperity of the young gentiluomo. The architectural ruins in the background, possibly inspired by engravings published by the Antwerp engraver and graphics publisher Hieronymus Cock (1518-1570), have an emblematic, symbolic character. They remind us of the past greatness of Rome and at the same time draw attention to the breadth of the subject's education

13931-grassi.jpg	The few works by this painter to have survived immediately remind us of Pordenone because of the impassioned way the figures are arranged and a characteristic tendency to make the forms ample, almost swollen, thus giving us the presentiment of a freer, almost seventeenth-century use of the line.In this painting, which for a time was thought to be the portrait of the famous architect and sculptor Sansovino, was later recognized as Raffaele Grassi, father of the painter and architect Giovanbattista

19100-12coupl.jpg	"It is assumed by critics that the sitters are Isaac Massa and his wife Beatrix van der Laen. However, it is debated by others. The pose of the recently married couple, leaning against the trunk of a tree, emphasizes the casual air of the portrait. The ivy twining itself around the tree and curling round at the woman's feet, who, in turn, has her hand negligently resting on the man's shoulder, symbolizes the permanence of the marriage. The thistle growing next to the man in the bare patch of ground at the bottom left of the picture may be an allusion to God's word to Adam after the Fall: ""Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee."" (Genesis 3, 17f.) Thus, the thistle may symbolize labour, itself a consequence of the Fall. In puritanical Calvinist ethics, which had already gained considerable currency in the Netherlands, work was considered a cardinal virtue, and achievement a central aspect of personal conduct.Frans Hals's work for this bourgeois couple included an Italian landscape background on the right - a sunlit villa, marble statue and spring - whose purpose was to create the impression of elevated rank and dignified elegance. However, the background features are fanciful, bearing no relation whatsoever to the real world of the couple. Rather than the couple's country residence, scrutiny of iconographical details shows the villa to be the temple of Juno, the goddess of marriage, whose attribute was the peacock"

37642-1paolo01.jpg	San Paolo Maggiore was the first Theatine church in Naples. Members of the Theatine Order modeled themselves after the apostles. to whose lives they  ascribed the virtues that formed the spiritual framework of life within the order. The Theatines were presented with their first church in Naples in 1538, the medieval San Paolo Maggiore. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they gave the structure a modern appearance and enriched it with lavish decoration.Francesco Solimena was commissioned for the decoration of the sacristy in 1689, and he completed the painting in 1690. This was the commission with which Solimena made his breakthrough, and at precisely the right time too put him into contention as the successor to Luca Giordano.The four bays of the vault contain three groupings of picture panels: the centre row, in which octagons alternate with lobed rectangles; the surrounding triangles filled with putti; and the caps of the vault above the windows, which are bracketed to the panels along the centre axis by cartouches. The centre panels contain female personifications of virtues, while the female figures in the caps above the windows are personifications of the eight Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount.Thanks to their large format and their multitude of figures, the scenes on the end walls are largely responsible for the magnificent effect of the space. On the north wall the Conversion of St Paul is depicted, on the opposite south wall the Fall of Simon Magus can be seen

17982-06scene.jpg	"In the following scene of The Expulsion of the Devils from Arezzo, the saint drives the devils out of the city. An inscription on the city walls names the place where the event took place: CIVITAS ARETII. It is not, however, identifiable solely by the added sign with the place name, for Benozzo has created a realistic image of Arezzo in his depiction of the church of San Francesco, the baptistery of Santa Maria Assunta, the Palazzo Pretorio, the cathedral of San Donato and the municipal palace. Some of the buildings which stood there during the artist's life were not built until after the death of St Francis. With this picture of the town, familiar to observers of the time, Benozzo was reminding his contemporaries of the continuing validity of the saint's authority.The small-scale landscape is arranged as if seen from above. The two figures in the picture - an older Franciscan monk whose hand is raised in blessing to heaven, and St Francis who is kneeling, deep in prayer - do not blend harmoniously with the landscape but appear to be standing in front of a backdrop. In addition, it becomes noticeable that the landscape and city views are not depicted using a uniform perspective. In this context it is significant that the two figures cover the transition in the picture from city to countryside.This is another scene in which the artist deviated from the familiar scheme: instead of using an architectural backdrop, he placed the two protagonists in a lavishly painted landscape.The inscription beneath the picture reads: QUANDO BS.F. EXPULIT DEMO(N)ES DE CIVITATE ARETII DIVINA POTENTIA ET PACIFICAVIT TOTU(M) POPULU(M) - ""How St Francis used divine power to drive the devils out of the city of Arezzo and brought peace to the entire population."

17160-portra12.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 492 JH 1642.Van Gogh painted two portraits of the Roulin's seventeen-year-old son, Armand. Both were completed in November 1888 but neither on the size of canvas originally planned. One  shows a young man in profile, dressed in a dark blue suit and matching hat; the other, probably the first version, presents Armand Roulin full face, in a citrine jacket and contrasting hat and waistcoat of blue. Both paintings are very simple in their composition, presenting the young man without any additional details, decoration or scenery such as are provided in the portraits of the Roulin parents or in others where colour, setting or costume attempt to introduce layered meanings. What is remarkable in both these pictures is the seriousness of expression, which is almost sombre and sad. This effect of the features contrasts with Armand's almost dandyish dress, the rakish angle of his hat, and the carefully painted knotting of his cravat

25969-04noport.jpg	Memling was one of the great portrait painters of the northern Renaissance, and a large number of portraits by him survive. Although born in Germany, he is considered a Flemish painter because he spent most of his life in Bruges, where he was influenced by Van Eyck in his quest for an exact likeness and fine detail.Memling's work was particularly popular with members of the large Italian community in Bruges. Tommaso Portinari, a Florentine who represented the Medici bank in Bruges, married Maria Baroncelli in 1470, when he was 38 and she was 14. It was soon after their marriage that Portinari commissioned this exquisite pair of portraits of himself and his wife, which must have originally been the wings of a triptych.

35949-3utrech4.jpg	The Haarlem artist Pieter Jansz. Saenredam is one of those Dutch painters who specialized throughout their lives in a single field, gradually perfecting their execution of the chosen subject; he devoted himself almost exclusively to church interiors. Painters of architecture are generally rather limited in their range of motifs and their means of interpretation, but Saenredam was so deeply absorbed in his subject and gifted with such pictorial eloquence that his works must be counted as masterpieces.This picture is typical of his calm compositions of simple, undecorated Protestant churches, their interiors occasionally enlivened by the inclusion of an awe-inspiring old tomb or statue, whose beauty and monumentality are enhanced by the painter's restraint in excluding all anecdotal detail; nothing disturbs the silence of the church. Saenredam's is an artistic vision set apart from the turmoil of the world, a harmony of perspective and light

42160-3angeli.jpg	The art-historical importance of the Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, near Viterbo, is the famous pentagonal ground plan and round interior courtyard, and the interior frescoes. The Palazzo was built for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520-1589) who was made cardinal by his grandfather Pope Paul III (1468-1549), and named vice chancellor of the Holy Roman Church a year later, according him the highest position after that of the pope in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The architect of the construction of the palace was Giacomo da Vignola.The commission for the interior decoration went to Taddeo Zuccaro, who was to make drawings and cartoons for the painting and stucco work but he had to work there only to review from time to time the work that had been carried out there. He largely assigned the execution to others, in particular his brother Federico. After the death of Taddeo Zuccaro in 1566, his younger brother Federico continued the work until 1569. His successor was Jacopo Bertoia, then Giovanni de' Vecchi, assisted by Raffaellino da Reggio.The Sala degli Angeli on the piano nobile is decorated with religious themes. In 1572 Jacopo Bertoia depicted the Fall of the Angels on the vault but did not work further on the room. Only two years later was the room finished by Giovanni de' Vecchi with the depiction of various angelic appearances

44083-07este.jpg	The sitter in this fine portrait is Francesco d'Este, the illegitimate son of Leonello, the duke of Ferrara, who received his military training in Brussels in 1444 and spent the rest of his life in Burgundy. The ring and hammer he holds may be emblems of office or tournament prizes. This panel was probably painted about 1460, when Francesco was close to 30. With his elongated features and introspective gaze, Francesco is the paragon of aristocratic aloofness. On the back of the panel the Este coat-of arms with Leonello's crest, the hooded lynx is depicted.Rogier's male portraits are built on similar structural principles and expressive qualities to those of the female portraits. Francesco d'Este has a stately presence as a knightly nobleman, with his broad chest filling the whole of the pictorial area horizontally, but his expression makes him appear a man of great refinement, almost a sufferer from ennui. With his long, thin fingers, the extended little finger almost echoing the curve of his nose, he holds the small hammer and the ring in an elegant gesture perfectly suited to his facial expression

22647-10annun.jpg	An orphan placed in the friary as a child, Fra Filippo took his vows at Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence in 1421, in time to observe Masaccio and Masolino at work on the famous frescoes there. He was more suited to the life of a painter than to that of a Carmelite, for in 1456, while chaplain to a convent in Prato, he induced a nun to elope with him. She was to bear him a child, Filippino, who grew up to be an excellent painter of outstandingly chaste morals. Filippo was employed as an artist by the Medici, and through their intercession obtained a special dispensation to marry Filippino's mother.The Annunciation is one of a pair of panels originally from a Medici palace in Florence; the other, hanging also in the National Gallery, depicts seven saints of special significance to the family. The shape and subject matter of both panels suggest that they were part of the furnishings of two separate but related rooms, either as bed-heads or as panels situated above a bed or door. While the Seven Saints illustrates a dynastic theme through the male members of the family, the Annunciation would have been more suitable for a woman's room.The Medici device of three feathers within a diamond ring is `sculpted' in relief on the edge of the parapet which separates the Virgin's `garden enclosed' from her bedchamber. Mary's purity is further alluded to in the lilies held by the Archangel Gabriel and those growing in the urn between them. From the centre of the arched top of the panel the hand of God the Father has launched the dove of the Holy Spirit. Its spiraling flight path, outlined in glittering gold, is about to end in the Virgin's womb from which emanates a small scattering of gold rays. In Mary's submissive pose Lippi illustrates the moment in the Gospel of Saint Luke (l: 38) when she says: `Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.'All the qualities for which the Medici prized Fra Filippo's art are demonstrated in this image. The austerity of the centralised perspective (the slope of the floor is exaggerated to account for the angle at which the panel was originally to be viewed) and of the strict geometry inherited from Masaccio is tempered by the artist's sublimely delicate use of line, colour and ornament. The Virgin's transparent veil gently softens the curve of her neck and shoulders, Gabriel's peacock wings echo the curve of the arch. But the greatest beauty of the painting resides in the meeting of angel and Virgin, virtual mirror images of each other. The one inclines his profiled head and bends his arm in gentle deference, the other responds with grave humility

35585-03heads.jpg	This attractive oil sketch of a man's head in four different poses is undoubtedly one of the most popular Rubens works in the Brussels museum, if not of Rubens' entire oeuvre. For a long time experts were divided on whether to ascribe it to Rubens or to Van Dyck. The latest investigations into the paint layering appear to support the museum, which has always considered Rubens as the author.It is easy to understand the popularity of this work. The masterly painting technique - free, virtuoso and rhythmic - is easy to read. The human subject matter, without any barrier of complicated mythology or religious themes, speaks to us directly. The whiff of exoticism in the living representation of a man from a distant country tempts some, the dignified treatment of a member of a frequently discriminated racial group wins over others, and a third group of viewers rejoices at this picture of a human being full of apparently uncomplicated joie de vivre. Rubens would perhaps be surprised at the special predilection for this work of his. It is certain that he also gave this sketch the full force of his artistic ability. Added to this he took the technique of the oil paint sketch, developed earlier in Italy, to unknown artistic heights, as in the unique series of designs for the Torre de la Parada which are found in the Brussels museum collection. Rubens made sure that his sons would have such studies should they themselves want to become painters.But ultimately this type of facial study was intended for inclusion in much more ambitious compositions. Such telling observations from various angles were particularly suited to multiple, and hence highly economic, use in a very wide variety of paintings. The same head reappears for example in the Adoration of the Magi, also conserved in the museum, but then as the head of a turbaned wise man in the middle ground: here he is organically included in a detailed and monumental altarpiece, which today elicits much less enthusiasm and attention

35301-corinth.jpg	Rottmann came from a family of artists, which brought him into contact with other Heidelberg painters early on. In 1821, he began courses in history painting at the Munich Academy, and went on excursions in the Bavarian mountains to do nature studies. Sojourns in Italy in 1826-1828, and again in 1829, introduced him to the Roman manner of open-air painting. A key event for his development was his meeting the Bavarian crown prince, the future King Ludwig I, who lived in Rome. Ludwig commissioned Rottmann to paint the Italian Cycle in the Munich Hofgarten Arcades (1830-1833), a series of frescoes depicting Italian landscapes, which would remain a favourite subject.Another major work was the Greek Cycle, based on studies made during a visit to Greece in 1834-1835 and destined for the Neue Pinakothek in Munich. These were done in encaustic (a technique employing heated wax colours that fused after application), and Rottmann worked on them until his death. In these landscapes, the architectonic structure of rigorous, classical composition is combined with a dramatic treatment of colour, expressed through light and other natural phenomena

11279-301delac.jpg	The picture shows the Justice (260 x 1100 cm), the Mediterranean (300 x 118 cm) and the Ocean (300 x 118 cm).By a decree dated 31 August, 1833, Delacroix was commissioned to undertake his first state decoration, that of the Salon du Roi or Throne Room of the Palais Bourbon. This was the first of a succession of major commissions, on which Delacroix continued to lavish his talents until illness intervened. Between 1833 and 1854, Delacroix's monumental compositions spread across the Salon du Roi, the Library of the Palais du Luxembourg, the Galerie d'Apollon in the Louvre and the Salon de la Paix in the Hotel de Ville.This was a different matter from even the largest easel paintings. Delacroix had now to exercise his imagination on huge surfaces of very various shape: domes, ceilings, semidomes, friezes, pilasters, and coffering. The essence of decorative painting is unity with the architectural framework that it invests. It was this aspect of the commissions that offered Delacroix the greatest opportunity for experiment and enabled him to give of his best.Like Michelangelo when he began the decoration of the Sistine Chapel, Delacroix knew nothing about the technique of fresco. So before executing the first commission, Delacroix spent several weeks with his family in the abbaye de Valmont, in Normandy, experimenting with fresco. These experiments enabled him to invent his own technique. Aware of the limitations of distemper, and noting that fresco did not easily adapt to the climate, he decided to paint the walls of the Salon du Roi with oil, to which he added a little colourless wax or encaustic. This allowed him to imitate the mat surface of fresco and protect the colours from the effects of damp; it also made it possible to retouch his work, which the use of distemper would have ruled out. This was the technique that he used for all subsequent decorations.Throughout 1837, Delacroix worked alone on the Salon du Roi, accepting assistance only for certain ornaments, and in 1838, the public could finally admire the finished work. It comprised four large sections of a coffered ceiling each decorated with a large allegorical figure in classical dress: Justice, Agriculture, Industry and War. In addition, there were four little coffers representing Putti bearing emblems. On the pilasters, he personified the rivers of France and the seas or oceans that they flow into, such as The Garonne and The Mediterranean. A frieze running round the upper wall above the windows and doors echoes these themes, contrasting the evils of war with the virtues of justice, industry and agriculture

00576-024mark.jpg	In 1442 Andrea went to Venice where he frescoed the ceiling of the chapel of St Tarasius in the church of San Zaccaria together with an artist known as Francesco da Faenza (probably Francesco Torelli). This is the painter's first signed and dated work, although earlier, presumably in 1440-41, he had already painted a Crucifixion with Saints for the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, today in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. Both this painting and the San Zaccaria frescoes depicting God the Father, Saints and Evangelists, show what a strong influence the work of Masaccio and Donatello had on the young Andrea. And in particular, Andrea's interest in Donatello's sculptural and linear dynamic power already evident in the Santa Maria degli Angeli Crucifixion, becomes much more obvious in the ceiling frescoes in San Zaccaria.

13710-saronno.jpg	The overall design of the decoration of the dome and the paintings are by Gaudenzio Ferrari, the wood sculptures were executed by Andrea da Milano and Giulio Oggione.Domes, which vault the crossing and altar of countless churches, lend themselves well to being transformed into paintings of the sky. The round shape above our heads seems to  open onto a higher world, so that God and the things of heaven become visually present at the church holiest spot.In their attempts to make manifestations of heaven in the dome convincingly realistic, artists did not always rely on illusionistic paintings of clouds. In the dome of the Marian sanctuary in Saronno, Gaudenzio Ferrari staged the Assumption of Mary as an interplay of sculptures and fresco. Mary is a wood sculpture standing on the drum of the dome, encircled by prophets and sibyls,; God the Father, another wood sculpture, is awaiting her with open arms in the crown of the dome. Ferrari painted the shell of the dome between them with dense wreath of angels singing and playing instruments. About fifty different instruments can be identified in the angelic concert. Ferrari, who was a musician himself,, not only leads the view up to heaven by means of painting and sculpture, but also hints at its joys with music and song

10192-adamev03.jpg	The subject of Adam and Eve was one of the most popular of the Cranach workshop, at least 50 paintings of Adam and Eve survive. The earliest surviving versions of Adam and Eve by Cranach, painted around 1510, show the nude figures against a neutral background. From the 1520s Cranach depicted Adam and Eve in a landscape setting accompanied by various animals. The version in Berlin belongs to these paintings.The present painting occupies a special position among the 50 versions because of the large number of motifs and the extraordinarily high quality of the painting, as shown by the porcelain-like smoothness of the human bodies. The landscape depiction gives much space to the flora and fauna, it features a lamb, a hind and a stag, two partridges, a stork, a roe deer and a stag, a heron, and behind them a lion, a wild boar, and a horse. In front of the tree is a vine with flourishing foliage. (The motif of the vine climbing up the apple tree and bearing grapes occurs in Cranach's early compositions.

Unhesitatingly he turns to Virtue, who is crowned with a laurel wreath.

15902-03woman.jpg	The presentation of reality by means of a luminous medium which decants the subtlest gradations of colour with extraordinary fidelity and assembles them with immediacy into images of lyrical purity is a feature also of the extremely rare portraits by Giorgione, amongst them this painting of the Old Woman. As with other pictures attributed with certainty to Giorgione hidden meanings have been searched for in the painting though the writing on the scroll - 'col tempo' (with time) - would seem to suggest that its subject is the fading of beauty over the years. Despite the damage suffered by the painting, it is still possible to admire the freedom of touch, the mellow transparency of the medium with which the half figure of the woman is realized and the extraordinary realism with which her lost beauty is explored. The description of the shriveled flesh, the aged eyelids, the toothless mouth, retains nothing at all of the Nordic prototypes and uses colour alone to create an objectively naturalistic image with consummate skill

35760-parents.jpg	This painting uses the same symbolism as in The H�lsenbeck Children, painted a year before.The physical appearance of the parents is wonderfully represented as the fading of the physiognomy of human beings, as life passes by.The children are not only descendants, they are counterpart of the old couple and also signify the changes in nature. This is the co-existence in time of youth and age, to a certain extent the symbol of rebirth. The girl is pointing to a flower and the old mother also holds in her hand a rose that has been plucked, and so will soon wither. And just as the father is leading his old wife by the arm, so the boy is also holding the girl right, while himself leaning to pick a flower

11499-forest.jpg	In France the search for national identity, the concern to put down roots in one's own territory, had been in evidence since the 1830s among such artists as Th�odore Rousseau and his successors, prompted by the English example of John Constable and Richard Parkes Bonnington or that of the seventeenth-century Dutch masters. In the process, they deliberately rejected any reference to the Italian landscape, the very basis of historical landscape, which had been an academic genre since 1818 and was to be swept away as obsolete in the 1863 reform of the �cole des Beaux-Arts. They likewise detached themselves from the picturesque quality associated with Romantic trips to the French provinces in order to concentrate on essentials, namely the representation of nature. Charles Le Roux, Jules Dupr�, and Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pe&#241;a encountered Th�odore Rousseau before 1840. The so-called Barbizon School was dominated by the restless and highly poetic personality of Rousseau, who finally settled in the little town on the edge of the forest of Fontainebleau in 1848.This painting shows Diaz, the landscapist, at his best. He obtained spectacular effects by means of impasto combined with colour contrasts

37876-pieta.jpg	"In the course of the restoration that followed the National Gallery's acquisition of this painting, the painter's signature came to light. As Stanzione styles himself as ""Cavaliere"" in the signature, we may date the work to after 1621, the year in which the painter was knighted. Scholars agree in assigning the painting to the earlier phase of Stanzione's career, to somewhere between 1621 and 1626. The painting shows not only the influence of Battistello Caracciolo, but also that of Vouet and Honthorst, foreign masters to whom Stanzione was exposed during his first stay in Rome (1617-20).In contrast to the prototypes of Ribera and Battistello, Stanzione shows a desire to interpret the theme in a measured, classical sense. He does not exaggerate the tones of tragedy but instead leads the viewer into the circle of most intimate and quiet sentiments; no less intense than a more extroverted and dramatic treatment might have been. The most human and heart-rending gesture of the mother, who bends to kiss the hand of her dead son, sums up the quiet emotionalism of the picture. A poignant detail invented by the artist and not present in any of the models mentioned, this passage is illuminated by a sharp ray of light, and stands out against the dark background to serve as the emotional fulcrum of the entire composition.Stanzione's use of light is highly sophisticated: it is closer to Ribera than to Battistello, and is enriched with motifs derived from Saraceni. An illustrative passage is the spot of light that grazes the nose of the Virgin, a figure otherwise completely enfolded in shadow. Likewise, the splendid body of Christ is illuminated with consummate pictorial wisdom"

20995-william1.jpg	The Prince of the Netherlands, Charles V (1500-1558), was also King of Spain and Emperor of Germany. He believed in a centrally governed state, with a single religion - Catholicism. In 1555 he abdicated, and his son Philip II (1527-1598) succeeded him as King of Spain and Prince of the Netherlands. Philip maintained his father's centralist policy and thus clashed with the Dutch nobility, who sought greater independence and also objected to the strict legal restrictions on Protestants. When their petition for tolerance was rejected in 1566, the Dutch broke out in open rebellion. Churches were attacked and images of saints destroyed. This wave of iconoclasm was the start of the Dutch revolt against Philip II. The revolt was led by Prince William I of Orange (1533 - 1584), stadholder of Holland and Zeeland (1533-1584). After his death his sons continued the struggle, which was to last 80 years and became known as the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648).William of Orange championed freedom and tolerance and led the Dutch revolt against Philip II's harsh regime. In 1580 he was declared an outlaw, and in 1584 he was assassinated. Key lived in Antwerp, as did William at the time this picture was painted. It is therefore highly likely that the prince actually sat for his portrait. This was not always the case; instead, artists often copied existing portraits

04496-stilmous.jpg	Abraham van Beyeren, the third outstanding master of pronk still-lifes, like Jan Davidsz de Heem, who seems to have inspired him, painted sumptuous compositions of lobsters, fruit, and expensive tableware, and included rich draperies and columns to enhance the splendid effect. Van Beyeren, however, hardly ever overloads his compositions in the way that de Heem does; on the other hand, he seldom shows Kalf's moderation. At his best, he is a subtle colourist who works in a light key, with an appealing free and liquid touch.

00325-3poggio.jpg	Allori's The Banquet of Syphax is located on the long wall of the Salone containing Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome. Allori placed the event in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape. He perhaps found his inspiration in Venetian painting, in particular, Paolo Veronese's depictions of banquets.Syphax was a king of the ancient Numidian tribe Masaesyli of western Numidia during the last quarter of the 3rd century BC. His story is told in Livy's Ab Urbe Condita (written c. 27-25 BC). In his twenty-eighth book Livy records that Scipio, coming from Carthage, was surprised to encounter Hasdrubal, who had retreated from Spain before the Romans, at the court of the Numidian prince Syphax. Their host was flattered that both combatants had sought his support. He invited Scipio and Hasdrubal to share a meal, where the scene that Allori depicted took place.

16031-franc10.jpg	This is the tenth of the twenty-eight scenes (twenty-five of which were painted by Giotto) of the Legend of Saint Francis.During the civil war in Arezzo, St. Francis saw demons over the city. He called upon a brother of his order, Sylvester, to drive them out. The picture area is dominated by the architecture of the city, which is divided from the rest of the world by a crack in the earth, and by the towering church building. Giotto portrays the saint deep in prayer in front of the latter. His strength seems to pass to Brother Sylvester, who raises his hand commandingly in the direction of the city of towers. Thereupon the demons flee, and the citizens can return to their business in peace - they can already be seen at the city gates

15011-tahiti69.jpg	This canvas, typical of Gauguin's late style, is one of the most successful paintings done on Tahiti. The animal stands at the front in water amidst mysterious vegetation. In the centre and background are two almost hidden horsemen emerging from the branches of the trees.The horse was a comparatively rare animal in Polynesia, having been introduced from the West in the sixteenth century, but Gauguin has placed these three animals in this tropical eden as if they belonged there quite naturally. The white horse in the foreground lends the work its name, but this title was given to the work by Daniel de Monfreid long after Gauguin's death. It is riderless, but the two animals in the background are mounted. It is difficult to know exactly what Gauguin intended by the work, given the absence of his usual inscribed title, but the lush vegetation, rich colours and naked figures suggest an earthly paradise in which man and nature co-exist quite happily.In the Polynesian imagination the white horse is a sacred animal. Gauguin was able to express this artistically by borrowing the stance of the horse from the frieze on the Parthenon in Athens, of which he possessed old photographs.After he had moved to Hivaoa in 1901, Gauguin returned to the theme of horse and rider, in two works that are clearly influenced by the Parisian racing scenes of Degas

30510-charon.jpg	Patenier, working in Antwerp, was a landscape specialist, often providing the backgrounds to the figures of other masters such as Massys or Isenbrandt. In his own work the landscape becomes the dominant element, so that the figure subject which justifies it becomes sometimes no more than a tiny incident in the foreground. The impression is sought of vast panoramic vistas, which are seen not from a natural but from an artificially high viewpoint. Typically the landscape is enlivened by dramatic effects of wheather or the outbreak of fire, in a manner influenced by Bosch.According to classical tradition, Charon, the boatman carried the souls of those entering Tartarus or Hades across the River Styx in his boat. In this painting the artist constructed a deep vista of a river and its two banks. Because of the bird's-eye view and horizontal picture format, the world seems to unfold beneath us. In spite of many naturalistic details, this is a highly contrived landscape; the perspective is applied  inconsistently and the movement through three distinctive colour zones is formulaic.

39746-11venusa.jpg	Aside from citations in various inventories, the complicated history of this picture is also traceable through a letter written by F Mueller, the correspondent in Italy for the court of Bavaria. According to Mueller, the work was originally painted for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who intended it for his picture gallery in Prague. It was then carried to Sweden as booty by King Gustavus Adolfus, and passed by heredity into the collection of Queen Christina of Sweden. After her abdication in 1654, she brought it with her to Rome where it decorated her palace there. With Christina's death in 1689, the picture passed to her heir Pompeo Azzolino and was later acquired from him by Livio Odescalchi, who purchased a large part of Christina's collection. It then passed successively to the French regent Phillipe d'Orleans, who took it to Paris, and to Czar Paul I of Russia, who took it to Saint Petersburg. When he died, the painting was acquired by the Venetian merchant Pietro Concolo, who took it back to Venice. There, the work was bought by Capparoni, Giovanni Torlonia's agent for the acquisition of artworks.Mentioned as a work of Titian in all the inventories, beginning with that of Christina of Sweden, the painting is one of the artist's several versions of the evidently popular subject. The acknowledged prototype is the example at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, which depicts Adonis without the red hunter's cap.Some scholars considered the Palazzo Barberini painting a copy with variants; while others regarded it as an autograph replica

07954-triptyc1.jpg	The central panel shows the Piet&#224;, while on the wings St Cecilia (left) and St Ermenegildus are represented.This small triptych originally belonged to Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, and the Farnese inventories document it as a work of Annibale Carracci as early as 1619. The attribution to Annibale was unquestioned until 1956 when, for stylistic reasons, the tabernacle was assigned to the Carracci workshop and given specifically to the hand of Innocenzo Tacconi. Despite this, the general conception of the work was attributed to Annibale on the basis of a drawing preserved at the Louvre (Paris). More recently, the documentary research  has proven that the painting was commissioned directly from the artist by Cardinal Farnese sometime after 1603, the year in which he was obliged to renounce his claims to the succession to the English throne. Considering the importance of the commission, it seems difficult to argue against attribution to Carracci himself. The high quality of the Piet&#224; and stylistic comparison of this central panel to Annibale's many other treatments of the subject lead to the assignment of this part of the execution to the master. It is, however, possible that Annibale allowed assistants (Innocenzo Tacconi or Antonio Carracci) to work on secondary panels, as these are slightly different in some of the details of execution.

The soft Arcadian light of his work perfectly suited the rococo sensibilities of the time and he was hugely successful commercially, both with European and Russian clients. In his landscapes, both real and imaginary, he specialised in blending a description of atmospheric mood with a reverence for the past, filling his scenes with the classical ruins he had studied during his stay in Italy from late 1754 to 1765.

40762-06icon.jpg	"The icon was originally part of the Feast-day Tier of an iconostasis. Its theme is the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross. It commemorates the legendary ""Invention"" or Discovery of the True Cross by Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, which is said to have happened in the year 320.The Exaltation of the Cross is represented on the icon in a solemn, strictly symmetrical composition: against the background of a massive round church with ""Russified"" onion domes, the centre of the icon features Bishop Makarios of Jerusalem on a large, two-stage ambo (a kind of pulpit) with a semicircular rear wall. Assisted by two deacons, he holds aloft the relic of the Cross. The festival is attended by Helena and Constantine on the right-hand side, and a group of singers in characteristic full-length garments and the head-covering known as the scaranica. The depiction is in the laconic style characteristic of Novgorod, confining itself to essentials, and preferring a bright, limpid coloration, in which dark green, a luminous vermilion dominate alongside white and ochre"

39369-26lasts.jpg	The Last Supper is on the wall of the Sala Superiore.Tintoretto's capacity to always give a new, different interpretation to one of the best loved and most repeated themes of his figurative repertoire is remarkable. In the foreground two large figures of poor people at the sides of the restless dog are crouching on the steps. Beyond them the two-coloured check marble floor which rises towards the kitchen area in a steep and oblique perspective flight, is cut across diagonally from the right by the very long table against the shadowed wall which marks the limits of the rooms. Along the table the figures rapidly and proportionally get smaller.The apostles are caught by two sources of light, one coming from the foreground and a second one which spreads from the passage in the background on the right, and they are highlighted by chiaroscuro in a tumult of spiritual poses and attitudes which spread along the table with vivid dramatic force only to quieten down in the figure of Christ. His is the smallest figure even though he is immediately recognizable by the dazzling halo. He has just aroused many emotions by introducing the sacrament of Holy Communion and by announcing his betrayal by one of the Apostles.The manna that fell from heaven has now descended from the ceiling to be transformed into the wafer offered to a slightly aloof, muted Peter. John has almost disappeared behind Christ, crushed under the weight of his dejection. Some diners, however, are happy with any bread at all, or perhaps just crumbs

03414-07cardin.jpg	Earlier this painting was attributed to Titian as a portrait of Cardinal Pietro Bembo. However, the suggestion that the picture portrays the cardinal can be ruled out, since the model does not resemble known likenesses of Bembo. In the nineteenth century the painting was variously attributed to Titian, Savoldo or Jacopo Bassano. Though some doubt remains, in recent times the attribution to Bassano is the most readily accepted.In the course of the restoration carried out in 1988-89, the raised right arm was uncovered from beneath an earlier repainting; it thus became clear that the picture is a fragment of a larger composition.

31480-rosso1.jpg	The Palazzo Brignole Sale (dubbed Palazzo Rosso because of the colour of its stucco exterior) was erected between 1671 and 1679 on the prestigious Strada Nuova (present-day Via Garibaldi) in Genoa. The decoration of the palazzo was accomplished in two phases. In 1687-89 the team of Domenico Piola and Gregorio de Ferrari - with the assistance of Niccol&#242; di Viviano Codazzi (1642-1693), Antonio Maria Haffner (1654-1732) and Sebastiano Monchi (c. 1630-1706) - painted the east wing, including the south loggia, then in 1691-92 the frescoes in the rooms of the west wing were executed by Giovanni Andrea Carlone with the assistance of Antonio Maria Haffner and Carlo Antonio Tavella (1668-1738). The quadratura painter Antonio Maria Haffner worked both for the Piola-Ferrari and Carlone teams.The works by Piola and Ferrari in the east wing, the four rooms on the third floor dedicated to the Four Seasons, are considered the highlights of the entire decoration. The ceiling paintings of the Seasons, striking in their vivid colours and their synthesis of influences from Correggio and Pietro da Cortona, are among the most successful achievements of Genoese painting from the High Baroque.The cycle of the seasons was a favoured subject in room decoration. The cycle illustrated in the Palazzo Rosso deviates from the traditional iconography, replacing the familiar pictorial motifs with deities and personifications. Spring is represented by Mars and Venus, presented as contrary forces suggestive of the months they dominate. The image and spirit of summer are embodied  by an extremely foreshortened Apollo-Helios, barely recognizable against the glowing sun, and a lion symbolizing summer's zenith. Autumn is personified by Bacchus with Ariadne and his train made up of satyrs, Maenads, and cupids. Personifications of the cold winds Eurus, Borea and Austro represent winter.

15592-09visita.jpg	The Mus�e du Louvre in Paris owns a panel painting by Ghirlandaio which differs from others. Like one of the frescoes in the Tornabuoni Chapel, it depicts the Visitation. Ghirlandaio painted the work in 1491 for a private chapel the Tournabuoni owned in the church of Santa Maria Maddalena dei Pazzi. Studies of the garments show how carefully Ghirlandaio prepared each individual figure for this unusual work. That is particularly true of the figure of Saint Mary Salome who is walking in from the right with her hands folded in prayer; wearing a classical flowing garment, she is reminiscent of figures by Filippino Lippi. On the opposite side Saint Mary Jacobi is adopting a most traditional pose, but unusually is looking out of the picture to the left. These two figures at the sides are cut off by the edge of the picture, and this brings a more animated note to the peaceful group of the two main figures. Particularly charming is the contrast between the youthful face of Mary and the old face of Elizabeth

01004-rural_sc.jpg	"A 1692 Chigi inventory lists two paintings, the Rural Scene and the Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue (see at Cerquozzi) and indicates that they are the product of a collaboration between Angeluccio, who painted the landscape, and Michelangelo Cerquozzi, who painted the figures.These pictures and the documentary reference to them are an important basis for the reconstruction of the career of Giovanni Angelo, known by his nickname ""Angeluccio"".The biographer Pascoli mentions Angeluccio as a student of Claude Gell�e (also known as Claude Lorrain), saying that among Claude's disciples there was ""of renown only Angeluccio, who died young and was only able to work a little"". Perhaps of Flemish origin (he is cited as a Fleming in an eighteenth century inventory of the Valenti Gonzaga collection), he shows the influence of the Flemish landscape technique, with particular closeness to the work of Bril. His typical compositional characteristics are the rendering of a spatial depth, the showing of the horizon through an aperture in the dense foliage of the large trees, the domination of landscape over the relatively tiny figures, and the intense play of light and shadow.Working in Rome probably between 1640 and 1650, Angeluccio was influenced by Swanevelt and Jan Both, and was an active member of the ""Bamboccianti"".Though Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi. Angeluccio seems to have furnished background landscapes for his fellow ""Bamboccianti"" much as Viviano Codazzi executed architectural backgrounds for them. A hypothesis has even been advanced that the nickname ""Angeluccio"" is derived from the closeness of this artist to ""Michele Angelo"" Cerquozzi. The fruits of this collaboration entered into numerous important Roman collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the inventories of which either report the pictures as ""by Angeluccio with figures by Cerquozzi"", or as landscapes by Angeluccio alone"

It is situated in the bottom row on the right side above the scene of Pilate's First Interrogation of Christ.The surroundings for the scenes in which Pilate appears (Christ Accused by the Pharisees and Pilate's First Interrogation of Christ) are new since the events take place in the governor's palace. The slender spiral columns of white marble and the decoration carved along the top of the walls seem to refer to classical architecture. Pilate too, portrayed with the solemnity of a Roman emperor and crowned with a laurel wreath, evokes the world of classical antiquity. It is interesting to note how the latter's face still bears the slashings caused by medieval religious fervour. The function of the beams placed on the capitals supporting a light and apparently unstable wooden roof is harder to explain.As in the gospel, the group of Pharisees, animated by lively gestures (again the hand with pointing finger), is depicted outside the building: the Jews avoid going inside in order not to be defiled and to be able to eat the Passover meal.

44777-casilda.jpg	Zurbar�n at his best may be said to have given new life to certain qualities found in the Mozarabic miniatures and Romanesque panel paintings - majesty, serenity and brilliance of colour. He had already made his name, and was a court painter - though he had not yet come under the not altogether felicitous influence of Murillo - when he painted this Andalusian girl with her attractively irregular features, elegantly dressed in heavy, shimmering silks, wearing pearls and a coronet and holding roses in her hand, the only indication of her identity. For St Elizabeth of Portugal is associated with the miraculous transformation of bread into roses as was St Elizabeth of Hungary and Thuringia. There are many versions of the story of Elizabeth's miracle of turning bread into roses, but they are all fundamentally the same. She is said to have been forbidden by her unfaithful husband to give to the poor. Having hid bread to give away in her apron, she encountered King Diniz, who asked her what she was carrying. Not wanting to let on that the contents of her apron were meant for the poor, she responded that they were roses. The bread was transformed into roses, and King Dinis, who could not understand how she could have possession of fresh roses in January, did not punish his wife. The left side of the painting was cut

22636-06annunc.jpg	The Annunciation that Lippi painted for the Martelli Chapel in the Medici church of San Lorenzo is among his most gratifying paintings. And as luck would have it, the altarpiece with its fine predella is still in the same place for which it was painted, a majestic space designed by Brunelleschi. Lippi here participates in a strong perspectival exercise, especially in the buildings that recede into the background. But perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the painting, aside from the placement of both Gabriel and Mary on the right half the picture space, is the trompe l'oeil, transparent vase at the bottom, ready to receive the lilies held by the angel. Here Lippi seems to rival the Flemish masters who were experts at rendering nature objectively.The unusual pose that Lippi selected for his Mary Annunciate, with a strong twist of the body, has a parallel in Donatello's high relief Annunciation which the sculptor carved for the Cavalcanti Chapel in Santa Croce. In fact, the relationship of the standing Mary and the kneeling angel is the same in the two representations, although Lippi's style for representing faces is unmistakable and not related to Donatello's classicism of this period

44233-amersfoo.jpg	Withoos could never have seen Amersfoort as it appears in this colossal bird's-eye view; it must have been composed in his studio. The walled city, seen from the northwest, occupies the centre of the composition. Within the walls the Lievevrouwekapel can be recognized by its tall tower, the 'Lange Jan', and further to the left is the Sint Joriskerk. The Utrechtsepoort on the right marks the beginning of the road to Utrecht while at the Koppelpoort on the left side the river Eem flows out of the city past the new neighbourhood on the harbour. In the foreground three horses haul a cart loaded with sacks across the landscape.A characteristic feature of such bird's-eye views is the representation of the town in profile, seen from a relatively low altitude. The reason for choosing this angle is obvious: bird's-eye views were made by combining a number of different panoramic studies made from elevations such as mills, church towers or bastions. In the Netherlands such views were produced from at least the first half of the sixteenth century.On 13 November 1671 the Burgomasters of Amersfoort proposed that the Town Council purchase the View of Amersfoort 'ornament' for the Town Hall 'now and in the future.' On 27 November it was decided to pay Withoos 200 silver ducats, a sum so large that it must have been for this big canvas. Judging from descriptions and floor plans of the old Amersfoort Town Hall, the painting was subsequently hung in the council chamber. It has remained in municipal possession to this day. Although the Town Council probably did not commission the canvas, such a large cityscape was most likely intended for a government building.

09034-09aeneas.jpg	Compared with Poussin, Claude had a relative lack of interest in his subject-matter, and his attitude in this respect was much more akin to that of his contemporaries. This was that the subject should be obvious to those who looked for it but that it should not spoil the viewer's appreciation of the beauty of the landscape. From the 1640s onwards Claude invented a perfect compromise between subject and landscape: instead of repeating his favourite earlier subjects such as the Flight into Egypt (which was used merely as a vehicle for a landscape) he began to use the poetry of Virgil as a major source of his subject-matter.Unlike Poussin, who tried to imitate his source in as accurate a manner as possible, Claude used the poetry as a source of general inspiration for his pictures, which remained landscapes first and foremost. Virgil's pastoral poetry, the Eclogues and the Georgics, had already been used by Claude in a generalized way for his many scenes of shepherds resting, dancing or simply minding their flocks in an ideal landscape. The almost wistful verse of Virgil could be translated into paint by Claude without any pedantic references to specific passages, and without arousing any argument over the precise passage illustrated.The story depicted in the painting is from Virgil's Aeneid (4:362-392). The lovers, Dido and Aeneas, passed a whole winter in each other's company, until Aeneas was suddenly visited by Mercury, the messenger of the gods, with sharp orders from Jupiter to be on his way. He took his leave amid scenes of passionate pleading, vituperation and tears. When Aeneas had departed Dido built a funeral pyre in the palace and slew herself on it, using her lovers sword.The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 186).Henry Purcell (c. 1659-1695), the English composer and organist, composed an opera from the story of Dido and Aeneas.

05238-05right.jpg	"The right wing of the triptych represents the Hell.In composition, the Hellscape of the right wing of the Haywain stands between the discursive panorama of the Vienna Last Judgment and the monumental simplicity of the Hell panel at Venice. Reminiscent of the latter work, too, are the tall blasted ruin silhouetted against the flaming background and the damned souls struggling helplessly in the lake below, although the foreground is dominated by a new motif, a circular tower whose process of construction is shown in circumstantial detail. One demon climbs a ladder with fresh mortar for the devil masons on the scaffolding above, while a black-skinned companion raises a floor beam with a hoist.The significance of this feverish activity is not clear. Towers abound in medieval descriptions of Hell, but the devils are usually too busy ministering to their victims to engage in such architectural enterprises. However, St Gregory reports a vision of Heaven in which houses were constructed of golden bricks, each brick representing an ""almsdeed"" or charitable act by someone on earth, and were intended to receive the souls of the good. Perhaps Bosch has represented the hellish counterpart of these heavenly mansions, in which avarice, and not almsdeed, supplies the stones. On the other hand, Bosch's tower may be a parody of the infamous Tower of Babel with which men sought to storm the gates of Heaven itself. In this case it would symbolize Pride, the sin which caused the fall of the Rebel Angels and which is exemplified by the worldly prince and prelate and their retinue behind the haywain"

A native of Assisi, he is said by biographer Giorgio Vasari to have been a fellow-pupil with Raphael under Perugino, and to have assisted the latter in the Collegio del Cambio at Perugia, at Assisi, and in the Sistine Chapel.

09565-corot161.jpg	Seen slightly from below as she leans on a stone balustrade, the figure of a young Italian woman rises monumentally and with well-nigh classical statuesqueness against an atmospherically diaphanous background, consisting of a rocky slope with farmhouses, a tree trunk cut off at the right edge of the canvas, and a predominant sky dotted with small, gold-tinged clouds. The dense blue and black hues of the woman's garments set the figure off markedly from the background ambience.The dignified and serious basic mood of the picture is concentrated above all in the melancholy, shaded eye area of the face. The Italian costume, exquisite pearl necklace, and especially the noble facial features framed by wonderfully arranged black hair, exude a classical dignity, as if some figure of ancient legend had suddenly materialized before our eyes. She embodies the land of longing, Italy, and the charm of that intermingling of classical grandeur and subjective mood which every Romantic current in art again and again sought in the Mediterranean world

The dancing girl from the ""Fioretti,"" who is shown here between the two main figures in the scene, has been ordered by the Sultan to attempt to seduce the saint, and she later converts.

33573-102ports.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 123.Titus (1641-1668) was the last child born to Saskia and the only one to survive infancy. As with Hendrickje, there are no documented portraits of him, but about four or five portraits of the same boy are known, painted between 1655 and about 1662, and it would be unreasonable to doubt that they represent Titus. Rembrandt also made a number of drawings of him and may have used him as a model for religious pictures. Titus himself grew up to be an artist and several of his drawings have been identified. Titus could have enjoyed a comfortable life. After the settlement of Rembrandt's bankruptcy and his reaching the age of legal majority, the courts paid him nearly seven thousand guilders from Saskia's bequest. From 1660 he acted jointly with Hendrickje as his father's dealer but he died as a young man in 1668, the year before Rembrandt himself.The present picture was painted at the time of Rembrandt's bankruptcy, when Titus and Hendrickje Stoffels were administering the sale of his pictures.

42154-1view.jpg	The art-historical importance of the Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, near Viterbo, is the famous pentagonal ground plan and round interior courtyard, and the interior frescoes. The Palazzo was built for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520-1589) who was made cardinal by his grandfather Pope Paul III (1468-1549), and named vice chancellor of the Holy Roman Church a year later, according him the highest position after that of the pope in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The architect of the construction of the palace was Giacomo da Vignola.The commission for the interior decoration went to Taddeo Zuccaro, who was to make drawings and cartoons for the painting and stucco work but he had to work there only to review from time to time the work that had been carried out there. He largely assigned the execution to others, in particular his brother Federico. After the death of Taddeo Zuccaro in 1566, his younger brother Federico continued the work until 1569. His successor was Jacopo Bertoia, then Giovanni de' Vecchi.The Sala del Mappamondo on the piano nobile was painted by Giovanni de' Vecchi, assisted by Raffaellino da Reggio. The decoration of this room consists of monumental maps of the entire known world as well as the depiction of the forty-eight Ptolemaic constellations. The program was completed with portraits of the great discoverers Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan, and Hernando Cort�s above the doors and windows of the room; personifications of the depicted countries and parts of the earth; and in a frieze, depictions of the celestial legends with which the ancients had explained the creation of the twelve signs of the zodiac.Although Giovanni de' Vecchi designed the decorative system and painted the figures and the figurative scenes, assisted by Raffaellino da Reggio, specialists were enlisted for the maps, in particular the cosmographer Orazio Trigini de' Marii, who supplied the cartoons for the maps, and the painter Giovanni Antonio Vanosino da Varese, who painted the maps.The maps in the room reflected the most up-to-date scholarship then available

32755-02baron1.jpg	This angel is a fragment from the Baronci Altarpiece. The first recorded commission of Raphael - dated 10 December 1500 - is for an altarpiece in Andrea Baronci's chapel in the church of Sant'Agostino in Citt&#224; di Castello, a small town near Urbino. The altarpiece was dedicated to Nicholas of Tolentino, a 13th-century Augustinian hermit who was not canonized until 1446, though his cult reached an early highpoint of popularity, especially in Citt&#224; di Castello, around 1500. The altarpiece was badly damaged in an earthquake in 1789, and from 1849 onwards the surviving sections have been kept in various collections.According to Raphael's preliminary study (Mus�e des Beaux-Arts, Lille) the figure stood on the lower left, next to St Nicholas of Tolentino. The powerful modelling of the angel's head, and the emphatic expression on his face as he gazes upwards, indicate that it is an early work by Raphael

38778-silvio_d.jpg	Silvio and Dorinda was a pair of lovers from the pastoral play Il Pastor Fido, The Faithful Shepherd, by the Italian poet Guarini (1538-1612).

The subject is found in northern Baroque painting and shows Dorinda lying in the arms of the old servant Linco. Silvio kneels beside her, offering an arrow to Linco, at the same time baring his breast, since he has no further wish to live.Thivaert was a Dutch Italianate painter in Amsterdam who probably spent some of his productive years in Italy, enthralled by the Italian landscape. In his version of the subject, the landscape, painted with a light hand, is more than a showy background stage setting. Its emotional content serves as the setting for a mythical and poetic event. There is sufficient movement and pathos in the extended vista so that the asymmetrical placement of the Guarini episode does not upset the balance of the composition

18184-triumph.jpg	At Frederik Hendrik's death in 1674, his widow, Amalia von Solms, conceived a new plan to honour the life, deeds, and memory of her late husband in the Oranjezaal in her own new palace Huis ten Bosch. Constantijn Huygens would serve as adviser, and Jacob van Campen was commissioned to oversee the execution of the painted decoration. The decorations cover the walls of the cross-shaped central hall with chamfered inner corners from floor to ceiling and were executed not only by Pieter de Grebber but also Salomon de Bray, Caesar van Everdingen, Pieter Soutman, Gerrit van Honthorst, and Jacob van Campen himself. In addition to these Northern Netherlandish artists, several Southern Netherlandish painters were also retained, including Jacob Jordaens, who completed the largest canvas in 1652, Triumph of Frederik Hendrik, and Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert and Theodoor van Thulden.

00466-juno.jpg	Juno (Greek Hera) was the chief goddess of Olympus, both the sister and wife of Jupiter (Zeus). Her role in myth and are is principally that of the wife of a faithless husband, always plotting revenge on his many lovers. Her usual attribute is the peacock which was sacred to her in antiquity. In one of the affairs of Jupiter, the giant Argus of hundred eyes was set by Juno to watch over Io, the lover of Jupiter. When Argus was murdered by Mercury, in memory of Argus Juno took his eyes and set them in the tail of her peacock (Met. 1:721-4).Juno and Mercury, one of four mythologies painted by Amigoni for Moor Park, remains too little idealized, and faintly ludicrous. Imagination has been less exercised than industry; Amigoni's people are real enough to be commonplace - and to feel somewhat at ease when shown sitting on clouds. with Amigoni the rococo remains solid and earthbound

42839-07cruci2.jpg	Veronese painted numerous Crucifixions toward the end of his life. Only in the canvas now in the Louvre did he stick to the scheme used in the picture of the same subject painted for San Nicol&#242; della Lattuga, placing the crosses of Christ and the thieves on the left and devoting the right-hand part of the painting to the figures of bystanders and the landscape. In the others (in the Venetian churches of San Sebastiano and San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti) he isolated Christ's cross at the centre of the painting, placing the figures of mourners at its foot. Common to all these works is the dramatic intensity of the image, accentuated by luministic effects and by the presence of dark storm clouds and oppressive and vaporous landscapes. The presence of blood flowing freely over Christ's body from the wounds in his side and hands is particularly significant, underlining the concept of the purification of humanity through the blood of the Redeemer

29838-tabern.jpg	Orcagna - a painter, sculptor and architect - was commissioned to execute the only significant, large-scale sculpture of the time in Florence, the mammoth tabernacle for Orsanmichele. This Gothic marble structure, rather like a miniature church, was a religious and civic edifice built to house Bernardo Daddi's repainting of a lost image of the Virgin and Child. Hexagonal reliefs of the virtues and octagonal reliefs of the Life of the Virgin alternate on its base. The programme culminates in the large relief on the back, the Dormition and Assumption of the Virgin, where the work is signed and dated 1359.The tabernacle is encrusted with precious lapis, gold and glass inlay that creates a brilliant, shining polychromy; it is especially dense in the celestial realm, rendering the area still flatter. The elaborate decoration is equivalent to the rich brocades in contemporary painting, a taste which blossomed with the International Gothic style

11132-early23.jpg	Degas produced many portraits between 1865 and 1870, too, the major ones of which were Th�r�se de Gas, Double Portrait, The Collector, Madame Hertel, Duke and Duchess of Morbilli, Jacques Joseph (James) Tissot, Mademoiselle Dihau at the Piano, Madame Camus at the Piano, Portrait of Hortense Valpin�on as a Child.Conventional as they may be, these portraits highlight both what is characteristic and what is casual in the personality and deportment of the sitter. Although people are caught most of the time in a casual pose expressing the charm of a fleeting mood, formal behaviour breaks through sometimes, as in the Portrait of Madame Camus at the Piano. She was the wife of Doctor Camus, a friend of Manet and Degas and a lover of Japanese art, and she had an excellent reputation as a pianist. The painting still shows the faint influence of Ingres's style, but it also evokes Manet in its refined elegance. In a masterful arrangement, the model sits in a room surrounded by angular shapes.

00347-judith.jpg	Judith with the Head of Holofernes has been described as the most celebrated of all Florentine seicento pictures. It exists in numerous versions, the best known being that in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence, painted for Grand Duke Cosimo II. The primacy of the version in the Royal Collection, however, depends principally on the vividness of the characterisation, the freshness of colouring, and the numerous changes effected during the course of painting even after several preparatory drawings had been made. Many of these changes are visible to the naked eye and accord with early descriptions of Allori's working methods. By contrast, the version in the Palazzo Pitti is slicker and more self-assured as a result of following an established design.The painting's reputation is derived from the autobiographical aspect of the treatment of the subject as recounted by Filippo Baldinucci (1625-96) in his Notizie de' professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua. Baldinucci records that Allori was essentially a libertine who was given to occasional bouts of piety. Regarding the subject of the present picture he states that the figure of Judith is a portrait of the painters lover, Maria di Giovanni Mazzafirri (died 1617), known as 'La Mazzafirra' that the features of the servant are those of La Mazzafirra's mother, and that the head of the decapitated Holofernes is a self-portrait of the artist. In essence, the composition commemorates an unhappy liaison and symbolises the suffering that Allori experienced at the hands of La Mazzafirra.The story of the Jewish heroine Judith, who saves her townspeople the Bethulians by cutting off the head of the Assyrian general Holofernes, is recorded in the Book of Judith found in The Apocrypha. The subject was frequently represented, sometimes as a straightforward narrative, sometimes with an allegorical (usually political) significance. The double meaning in the painting by Allori is confirmed by a poem by Giovanbattista Marino (La Galena, 1619), written in Paris where he saw one of the versions. Marino writes that Holofernes is killed twice, firstly by Cupid's darts and secondly by the sword. It is a theme that continues in literature certainly up to John Keats's La Belle Dame sans Merci. The female artists Lavinia Fontana and Artemisia Gentileschi depicted themselves as Judith, and there is an autobiographical element in the Judith by Jacopo Ligozzi of 1602 (Florence, Palazzo Pitti). Similar opportunities arose in the treatment of the subjects of David and Salome. Caravaggio, for instance, in the David and Goliath dating from 1605-06 (Rome, Galleria Borghese), used his own features for the head of Goliath. This last is a composition that Allori knew.

28405-duet1.jpg	The painting shows two well-dressed young people in a somewhat sparsely but, nonetheless, expensively furnished interior.  The young man plays a lute and the woman a cittern - an instrument like the lute, dating from the Renaissance, but with brass rather than gut strings, giving it a brighter, louder sound. The figures have been identified as Molenaer himself, and Judith Leyster, a fellow painter from Haarlem, whom he married in June 1636.The painting is probably a marriage portrait, an allegory of conjugal harmony.

33638-22sp1668.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 61.This work comes at the end of a long series of self-portraits, of which the painter never seemed to tire. Painting shortly before his death in 1669, Rembrandt depicts himself as a laughing grey old man at the easel. The uneven preservation and the dark colour - what the objects at the edges are can only be guessed at - make the interpretation very difficult. Most likely is the explanation that Rembrandt has portrayed himself in the role of the ancient painter Zeuxis, who died laughing while painting an ugly woman, a story that Rembrandt's pupil, Aert de Gelder certainly knew and contrasted with the better-known legend that Zeuxis had combined the best features of the five most beautiful girls he could find in order to produce a still more beautiful image of Helen of Troy.The dim bust in the left side of the painting is probaly Herakleitos.

34209-christop.jpg	"According to legend, the giant Ophorus carried the infant Christ across a river at night, and was pressed down below the surface of the water by the weight of the child, thereby being baptized. Thereafter he received the name Christophorus (""bearer of Christ""). In this night scene, Ribera reiterates the legend, but he adds more: he brings life to the figure of the giant, lending him an expression of incredulity and astonishment at the sight of the infant Christ. His physical power is evident in the drawing of his muscles of arms and shoulders. Paradoxically yet fittingly, Ribera has given him the flickering shadow of all-devouring ecstasy that predominates in a heightened form in his depictions of monks. It is a scene of superficial poverty without the brilliance of colour and luminosity. The miraculous experience of Christophorus is neither majestic nor historic, but is a sacred occurrence repeated daily before our very eyes"

34068-3renoi16.jpg	In 1883, Renoir painted two large dance scenes, Dance in the City, and Dance in the Country, conceived as pendants. Paul Lhote, a friend of the artist, served as the model for the male dancer in both pictures; the figures of the women and the treatment of the background are different.The elegant young woman in Dance in the City is pictured with her partner in a room in which the chic decor is emphasized by the pillar and the large potted plants. The dancer is the 17-year-old Suzanne Valadon, who later became a painter herself. The model posing for Dance in the Country, who gazes smilingly out at the onlooker, is Aline Charigot, who was 18 years Renoir's junior and whom he was to marry in 1890.These two paintings were created during a period in which Renoir started to distance himself from impressionistic paintings in the search for new stylistic media and subject matter.

22210-lastjud.jpg	The triptych is probably identical with the commission of 1526-27 by the van Swieten family for a memorial in the Pieterskerk, Leiden.During the iconoclastic riots of 1566, Lucas van Leyden's Last Judgment, his most famous painting, was saved from destruction by the city of Leiden. It was moved in stages from the Pieterskerk to the burgomasters' chamber in the town hall, where it could be seen by visitors for nearly three hundred years. In 1602 the township added to the glory of the painting by turning down a very generous offer for it from Emperor Rudolf II. The man who moved the painting to the town hall was an artist who served important positions in the Leiden city government for half a century, Isaac Claesz. van Swanenburg (1537-1614), the father of Rembrandt's first master, Jacob Isaacsz. van Swanenburg.

17118-3arles32.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 449, JH 1558.The town of Arles is on the Rhone, and that busy waterway appears in a number of van Gogh's works. He painted the quayside with stevedores at work as well as more panoramic views of the river as it sweeps its way through the town. But in such works there is something stylised and remote about his treatment, as if it was difficult to come to terms with this aspect of Arles.The present painting is curious. The barges and their workmen are solidly and attentively painted; but the setting is minimal and unfinished. Nothing indicates exactly where this is all taking place. A small stretch of quayside suddenly gives way to a sketchy river bank, a beach even. Beside the barges a man in a rowing boat is fishing, but his relation in space and scale to the barges is not clear. Van Gogh sent the painting to his friend and fellow artist �mile Bernard. A dedication was painted on the canvas which has since been erased

However, Aurora, who as the forerunner of the sun-chariot heralds the day, managed to free herself from this limited private sphere and became - thanks to Guido Reni's Aurora in the Casino Pallavicini - an allegory, ambiguous and applicable in many contexts, of ascent, new beginnings, or triumph over the powers of darkness, impressively staged by Guercino in the Casino Ludovisi and by Giuseppe Chiari in the Palazzo Barberini

28918-madruzzo.jpg	Moroni was held to be the best portraitist of his age. Even Titian himself put Moroni's ability to paint his models 'al vero' before his own. Born  in Albino near Bergamo, Moroni was Moretto's pupil in Brescia until about 1543, but he was strongly influenced by other artists, too, such as Savoldo, Lorenzo Lotto, and Titian. Apparently he hardly ever left the area around Bergamo. By about 1560 he had become the leading painter of the region and set the course of the Lombard school. He was particularly favoured by the aristocracy as a portraitist, but he also received several ecclesiastical commissions.The commission to paint formal portraits of two members of the Madruzzo family, which ruled as prince-bishops in Trent from 1539, was one of the most prestigious of Moroni's early career. Depicting the brothers Gian Lodovico (1532-1600) and Gian Federico (c. 1530-1586), they were to hang with a portrait that Titian painted of the young men's uncle Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo (1512-1578)

19842-09nolim.jpg	This Renaissance subject allowed the artists to explore the theme of human emotion proffered and supra-humanly rejected. Holbein's style is subtly different here from his other religious work of the early 1520s. It is more graceful, if somewhat awkwardly composed, and has an air of mystery.The Christ is akin to the melancholic long-faced figure in the Passion, but the chiaroscuro in the figures and their grace suggests some Leonardesque influence, if only second-hand. The profile of Mary Magdalene, the elegant phial she holds and her twisting pose are reminiscent of the figure style current in France, which Holbein visited at this time searching unsuccessfully for employment. It is probable that, adapt their conventions as he might, the robust, realist vein in Holbein seemed archaic to the sophisticates at King Francis I's court, who were to find the Italian Mannerism of Rosso Fiorentino much more to their taste in the following decade.The emphatic drama of Holbein's account can be contrasted with the more elegiac quality of light, the landscape, more tempered poses and slighter figures in Titian's rendering

43068-port_w_m.jpg	"Of the numerous individual likenesses of worthy sitters, most were intended to be seen with a ""pendant,"" another portrait that represented the person's spouse. Pendants of married couples were the bread and butter of portrait painters such as Verspronck. This pair of well-executed portraits of an unidentified couple is characteristic of the voluminous genre, which did not change significantly over the first three quarters of the seventeenth century, except at the hands of innovative portraitists such as Rembrandt.Even such apparently direct presentations rely on meaningful conventions. The paintings would have faced one another, perhaps on either side of a chimneypiece. Almost invariably, the woman's portrait would hang at right, the man's at left. From the perspective of the sitters, this convention placed the woman on the man's ""sinister"" (left-hand) or lesser side, according to theological and social formulas which valued the ""dexter"" (right-hand) position more highly. This rule conformed to seventeenth-century Dutch views of marriage as a partnership based on mutual affection but steered by the man"

33498-05portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 69.The old woman reading the Bible is the Prophetess. Hanna. She was present when Joseph and Mary brought their son Jesus to the Temple, and she immediately recognised Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah. The letters in the sacred book appear to be Hebrew, although they cannot be read as a text.The thoughtful portrayal of old people of both sexes is a conspicuous feature of Rembrandt's work, especially in his Leiden years. He also often represented old people singly. The models in these paintings are sometimes represented in their own persons, but more often they are dressed in one or more of the exotic costumes which Rembrandt accumulated and kept in his studio wardrobe.One elderly male and one elderly female model recur repeatedly in his work throughout the Leiden period - and not only in Rembrandt's work but also in that of his associates at this time, Gerrit Dou and Jan Lievens. In the past, these two figures were often identified as Rembrandt's father and mother. The old woman in the present picture appears in at least three other paintings by him, including Anna Accused by Tobit of Stealing the Kid and the first, Hamburg version of The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple, where she is the Prophetess Hanna.

32496-martyrdo.jpg	"This painting is commonly referred to as the Three-hand Painting (""Quadro delle tre mani"") as it was made simultaneously by three painters: Giulio Cesare Procaccini, from Emilia but who moved to Milan when very young, and Giovanni Battista Crespi (Il Cerano) and Morazzone from Lombardy, two of the finest painters in the Lombard school between the 16th and 17th centuries. They managed to transform this painting, refusing the rigid models of the Counter-Reformation by adopting a dynamic, expressive approach which was sometimes clearly theatrical.The painting shows the martyrdom of two saints: Rufina, who is still alive, is shown just an instant before the executioner's sword strikes her white neck. She is comforted by an angel who, with a hand pointing up towards the sky, appears to reassure her of the reward which will soon be hers for her suffering on earth. The other saint is Seconda, who lies already decapitated"

36566-depositi.jpg	The two memorable masterpieces, The Two Marys at the Tomb, and The Deposition (originally in the Capuchin church at Fontevivo, near Parma) give us cause to regret the brevity of Bartolomeo Schedoni's tormented artistic life. They show that he really would have been able to point Baroque painting in an original and intense direction. The way he blocked out gestures, used violent light and dazzling whites, combined with perfect clarity of detail to produce an almost metaphysical effect

44772-stillife.jpg	In the oeuvre of Zurbar�n, religious themes predominate, with particular emphasis on asceticism. He also painted many still-lifes, which, however, reflect the same qualities of asceticism, quiet contemplation and introversion for his choice of objects indicates the transience of human life.Zurbar�n does not do so by presenting a clock, a skull or an hourglass. Instead, on a brilliantly polished table, he shows us a pewter plate with lemons, a basket of oranges complete with leaves and blossoms, and a fine china cup on a silver saucer on which lies a rose in full bloom. Though lemons signify wealth in a Netherlandish still life, they have a very different meaning here, in the country where they actually grow. Even so, they are not represented as the fruits of daily life, but presented with all the solemn celebration of an offering on an altar.As in the paintings of his contemporary S�nchez Cot�n, Zurbar�n isolates the individual objects from one another - even the composition appears to be a conscious though not excessively artificial arrangement. Against the dark background, the objects are completely static, and appear to be torn out of the context of everyday life. The human beings to whom they apparently belong have no place here

31961-04emmaus.jpg	Pontormo executed the canvas for the Carthusian monastery at Galluzzo where he worked between 1523 and 1527. The painting depicts the episode in which the now risen Christ, repeating the same act of breaking the bread that he had made during the Last Supper, is about to be recognized by two of his disciples.The inspiration behind the figurative concept is certainly D�rer, from an engraving belonging to the series of the Little Passion (1511). D�rer and northern figurative culture in general were also behind the most striking characteristics of the canvas, the close adherence to an everyday reality that has frequently induced authoritive scholars of Pontormo to interpret this extraordinary work as heralding the realistic research of Caravaggio, Vel�zquez and Zurbar�n.The elimination of the distance between painted event and spectator and the foreshortened contact with reality are effects created by the inclusion of portraits of people living at the time and participating in the event, and the large naked feet of the disciples in the lower part of the painting, where the heads of cats can be seen, their inquisitive gazes directed towards the onlooker. A crouching puppy can just be seen in the lower left corner of the painting. The same attention to realism is also evident in the careful representation of the group of objects forming a still life on the table.The eye of God, painted above Christ's head, is a later addition

30700-principe.jpg	Andrea Doria (1466-1560) was the dominant figure in Genoa in his times. He was an extraordinarily talented naval commander. Coming from an impoverished branch of an ancient local family, he succeeded in enriching himself and reestablishing Genoese independence after protracted domination by the French. His fellow citizens named him Principe (Prince) and Pater Patriae (Father of the Homeland).Befitting his unique status in Genoa, Doria built himself a splendid seaside villa just outside the city's western gate (Villa Doria or Palazzo del Principe). He entrusted the design and the decoration of much of this complex to Perino del Vaga, one of Raphael's students. Perino was responsible for the entire decoration of the Salone dei Giganti. This splendidly decorated room is crowned by the representation of the Fall of the Giants on an enormous ceiling painting

43545-marriage.jpg	The painting shows Christ's first miracle. When the wine ran out at a wedding at which Jesus and his mother were guests, he changed the water into the finest wine - a perfect theme for the Tavern-Keepers' altar in the Antwerp Cathedral. The guild commissioned from marten de Vos, who was a very famous artist at the time. The time he spent in Venice had a noticeable effect on his work.The wedding reception is set in an attractive Renaissance interior with a table full of fine food and expensive crockery, and festively dressed guests. Three lute-players and a young singer play from a gallery. Most of the guests look like 16th-century Westerners. The three crowns above the bride and her immediate neighbours were a customary feature of weddings in de Vos's time. He tried, nevertheless, to evoke a somewhat Oriental, biblical atmosphere - several guests wear turbans, the bridegroom has a laurel crown and some of the servants' costumes are vaguely Roman. The large wine-jugs in the foreground have an especially classical appearance. Jesus and his mother stand out because of their simple, 'biblical' clothes. The guests are sure to include several senior members of the Tavern-Keepers' Guild

24643-grabow0.jpg	When the first wings of the altarpiece are opened, twenty-four painted panels, a solid screen of colour, are displayed with narratives placed in two rows, one over the other.In the top row on the left, the story of the Creation begins with the Separation of Light and Darkness, and it continues through the top twelve panels to the to the Expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Paradise and the Labour of the First Parents on the right. The lower register resumes the drama of Genesis across six panels with the stories of the Offering of Cain and Abel, the Murder of Abel, the Building of the Ark, the Sacrifice of Isaac, Jacob and Esau, and Jacob's Blessing. The final six paintings are dedicated to the Infancy of Christ, from the Annunciation to the Rest on the Flight into Egypt in the lower right.The attention to realistic detail, as well as the thematic scope of the altarpiece, which embraces the whole of the biblical spectrum, from good to evil and obedience to violence, point to a private patron, identified as Wilhelm Horborch, a member of an old patrician family in Hamburg. It was presumably he who was responsible for the iconographic program. His brother, Bertram Horborch, was mayor of the city from 1366 to 1396 and maintained close relations with Emperor Charles IV in Prague and the pope in Avignon. The work may have been commissioned by both brothers.The connection with Bohemia is significant. Master Bertram may have spent his apprenticeship with a Bohemian master in Prague. This would certainly explain the Bohemian colouring of his work. The commission for the Hamburg altarpiece may well have reached him when he was still working in Prague

It is situated in the bottom row on the left side below the scene of the Betrayal by Judas.Following the story in John again, the scenes succeed each other from the bottom upwards although occurring simultaneously. While Jesus is giving the new commandment to the apostles (now eleven), Judas betrays him for thirty pieces of silver. In Christ Taking Leave of the Apostles, his sideways position, shown up by the half-open door, is in contrast to the closeknit group of disciples. They are all turning the same way in thoughtful attitudes, the soft drapery of their coloured robes animating the whole scene.

17782-601goya.jpg	It has been suggested that this handsome, plump young woman is Goya's daughter-in-law, Gumersinda Goicoechea, and that the portrait was painted shortly before or shortly after the birth of his grandson Mariano. Though it is difficult to judge the resemblance to Goya's other portraits of Gumersinda - a profile drawing, a miniature in near profile and a full-length portrait of a much slimmer and more elegant figure, with a different coiffure - there is a similarity in the features that makes the identification credible.

33486-03histos.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 478.This imaginary portrait, one of Rembrandt's best-known works, was painted for Don Antonio Ruffo, a wealthy Sicilian nobleman and Rembrandt's only foreign patron, who had asked Rembrandt for a portrait of a philosopher. The artist sent the painting to Messina (Sicily) in 1654. He was paid 500 Dutch florine (gulden) for it.Rather than choose a single figure, the enormously inventive artist found a way to present three of the great men of antiquity: Aristotle, Homer, and Alexander the Great. Aristotle, the great Greek philosopher of the fourth century B.C., is shown in his library dressed in the robes of a Renaissance humanist. He rests his hand on a bust of Homer and wears a splendid chain bearing a medallion of Alexander the Great, who had at one time been Aristotle's pupil. The figure of Homer was certainly based on one of several Hellenistic busts owned by Rembrandt; the figure of Aristotle is reminiscent of Rembrandt's portraits of the Jews of the Amsterdam ghetto, whom he had often used as models in his biblical paintings. The solemn stillness of Aristotle's study, the eloquence of his fingers resting on the bust of the blind poet, and above all the brooding mystery in his face unite to communicate an image of deep thought

26598-09_2ce9f.jpg	The first scene in the chronological order of the narrative, The Separation of Light from Darkness, is depicted in the centre of the vault of the ninth bay.The beginning of the Creation is marked by the figure of God, seen from below, as he launches himself into infinite space with his arms raised, allowing spirals of light to sweep aside the darkness.The poses of the four ignudi are very different from each other, without any attempt being made to obtain an effect of symmetry. Thus, the one above Jeremiah at the left, with a classical profile and a meditative attitude, contrasts sharply with the ungainly movement of the one the right, who laden with foliage and acorns, is throwing himself forward, his face in the shadow. On the opposite side, the two figures bend toward the centre, but with their torsos heads rotating in opposite directions with clearly distinct movements, splendidly rendered thanks to the artist's skilled use of perspective.Above the cornices, the four ignudi bear medallions representing the Elijah ascending to Heaven on the Chariot of Fire (at left) and the Sacrifice of Isaac (at right)

19490-ybacchus.jpg	Soon after returning to Haarlem from Italy, Van Heemskerck created his Triumphal Procession of Bacchus, a fascinating amalgam of the art seen in Italy woven into a novel composition. Inspired loosely by Roman sarcophagi and by engravings after Mantegna, the composition is a living frieze. The figures are packed into the foreground as they progress through a ruined triumphal arch towards the temple of Bacchus. Bacchus, the god of wine, can scarcely sit up. The satyr supporting him playfully tweaks his breast and, with tongue wagging, stares lustily at the viewer. Two children hold up a mirror so the viewer can see an inebriated man who, having lost all decorum, defecates. Despite such moralizations, Van Heemskerck's intention was to devise a bacchanal, a modern counterpart to the scenes described in Roman literature. He delighted in showing off his talents at rendering the human body in motion. Some celebrants stand or stride, other do somersaults and walk on stilts. The horn player in the foreground conveys the artist's knowledge of anatomy and contrapposto.The painting is a pastiche of Roman sources. The standing man on the right was inspired by the Apollo in the de Sassi's collection. Raphael's Triumph of Galatea in the Farnesina and Michelangelo's paintings provided the sources for several figures. Van Heemskerck borrowed from his own drawings of the portico ofOctavia for the colossal foot, of the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli for the Temple of Bacchus behind, and of Michelangelo's Bacchus (now in the Bargello, Florence) which when in the Casa Galli was believed to be antique, for the cult statue within.

20973-stil_lif.jpg	This Flemish artist's teacher and uncle was Jan Brueghel the Younger, and therefore he was a direct descendant on his mother's side from Pieter the Elder and Jan the Elder. He painted chiefly still-lifes, frequently representing food laid out sumptuously on light-coloured tables and depicted with the delicacy of a miniaturist, using lively colours of a predominately red tint laid on with the tip of the brush.The documentary, informative, educational, and communicative function of these richly laid tables, in which the individual objects are simply added on and depicted from a slightly raised viewpoint, is combined with the evident intention of demonstrating the affluence of the wealthy patrons of these works. It is also possible to discern allegorical intentions alluding to the five senses or the four elements, but while such an interpretation is quite plausible, the principal aim is a purely aesthetic one, offering this profusion of beautiful objects, rendered with exquisite skill, as a simple feast for the eyes.There is a companion piece to this painting, a variation on the same theme, also on show in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj

09522-christ_a.jpg	In the foreground on this small wooden panel, one of the artist's earliest dated works, Jacob Cornelisz. van Oostsanen shows a scene from the story of the Resurrection as recounted in St John's Gospel. Mary Magdalene meets the risen Christ and mistakes him for a gardener. When she recognises him, she throws herself at his feet. Christ then speaks to her the words the artist has painted in artful Gothic lettering on the trim of his garment: 'Touch me not, Mary, for I am not yet ascended to my Father' (Maria noli me tangere - nondum enim ascendi ad patrem).In the middle and far distance, integrated in a finely-detailed landscape, the painter shows four more episodes grouped around the central motif; the two Marys at the empty tomb, Jesus meeting the three Marys, his encounter with the pilgrims on the road to Emmaus, and the meal at Emmaus. In the artist's time and later, it was quite usual to group together a series of events on one single panel, as it was indeed to show Mary as an elegantly-dressed early-sixteenth-century lady

09200-meagre.jpg	Art historian and restorer Jan van Dijk found this militia portrait by Frans Hals and Pieter Codde so 'barren and frail', in 1758, 'that they might rightfully be called the meagre company'. Since then this militia portrait has been known by that name instead of the exact title: Officers of the Company of the Amsterdam Crossbow Civic Guard under Captain Reynier Reael and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw.Frans Hals was commissioned to paint the portrait of Captain Reynier Reael and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw of the Amsterdam crossbowmen's guild together with their militiamen. He was to paint the piece in Amsterdam, where the members of the company lived. For Hals, who lived in Haarlem, this involved regular trips to the capital. In fact he was rarely to make the journey at all. In 1636, three years after receiving the commission, he had still only completed part of the painting. Eventually the militiamen took him to the task. In reply he responded, as the preserved documents state, that it had been agreed he would begin the portraits in Amsterdam and complete them in Haarlem. The representatives of the guild, however, claimed that they had even offered six guilders extra per portrait on the condition that Hals travel to Amsterdam to paint the men's bodies as well as their faces. Hals was to receive 66 guilders per person upon completion of the painting, a total of 1,056 guilders for the whole work. Despite the high rate, Hals could no longer be persuaded to make the journey to Amsterdam. He suggested that the unfinished work be brought to Haarlem, where he would complete the sitters' attire. Then he proposed to finish painting the faces, assuming that the militiamen did not object to travelling to Haarlem. By now the dispute had become so heated that the guild decided to ask another artist to complete the painting. The task fell to Pieter Codde, a strange choice since Codde's paintings were usually small and meticulous. Codde lived in Amsterdam, though, and may even have been a member of the militia company.Frans Hals painted the general outlines of the composition and completed some of the faces and hands, but only the ensign on the left, with the shiny satin jacket, is entirely by his hand.

18427-2108grec.jpg	This painting once decorated El Greco's tomb in one of the chapels of the Monastery of St Dominic (Santo Domingo El Antiguo) in Toledo. It was later transferred to the high altar for which it was originally intended. This ecstatic painting is one of the artist's most colourful works, which, unlike other paintings of this period, seems to have been entirely executed by his own hand, without the help of his son Jorge Manuel. Light radiates from the Child and the dazzling white cloth on which He lies, illuminating the figures of Mary and the amazed shepherds. From the very outset of his career El Greco had been interested in the problem of light: his early work A Boy Blowing on an Ember is primarily an exploration of the way in which a flaring light is reflected by the features of the face. When he painted The Adoration of the Shepherds, light was no longer used for its own sake but as a means to convey an idea. The words of the Pantocrator are occasionally to be found in Romanesque churches, usually inscribed in the apse, thus: Lux mundi (the Light of the World). In El Greco's picture this theme is now perfectly expressed in purely pictorial terms. The elongated figures, like tongues of fire, and all the indications of enthusiasm, faith and passion, are characteristic of a number of Mannerist painters but especially of El Greco. These characteristic features of El Greco's art are clearly seen in this beautifully realized creation which constitutes as it were a link between the Gothic style and modern art of the twentieth century.In contrast with his earlier interpretations of the same subject, El Greco seems to forgo any attempt to achieve balanced proportions, harmonious colouring and comprehensible space, transforming the scene into a transcendent and spiritual happening depicted in bright and contrasting colours. The bearded shepherd in the centre wears a bright orange-red jacket over yellow-green breeches, while St Joseph on the left appears in a purplish-blue tunic and yellow drapery. Blue and yellow recur in the garments of the standing shepherd to the right, whereas the man on his left wears green, contrasting handsomely with the rose tunic and blue mantle of the Virgin. Against the background of the sky composed of flashing whites and blues, a group of angels hovers above the scene. One holds a banderole with the words (probably added later) 'Glory to God in the Highest, and on earth peace'. Another crosses his arms in a pose similar to that of the shepherd below.This painting is one of El Greco's last paintings, and it is also one of his finest

32799-33carde.jpg	The Madonna of the Goldfinch, one of Raphael's Florentine panels, was painted by Raphael for the marriage of his friend Lorenzo Nasi and Sandra di Matteo di Giovanni Canigiani. It was severely damaged following the partial collapse of the Nasi house in 1547, as mentioned by Vasari. It was subsequently restored probably by  Michele di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio (Michele Tosini), a coworker in Ghirlandaio's workshop, who was deeply influenced by Raphael.The Christ Child is lovingly stroking a goldfinch that the boy Baptist has just given him. A symbol of the Passion (the goldfinch, because it feeds among thorns) is thus combined in a scene that can at a first level of meaning be seen simply as children at play.The composition follows that of the Madonna of the Meadow, with the essential difference that the children in the Madonna of the Goldfinch are more firmly united with the central figure of the Virgin. The colour is more lively than that of the Madonna of the Meadow and foreshadows the colourist character of Raphael's Roman paintings. The landscape, and particularly the architectural forms it contains, reflects the influence of Flemish art, even though it is still structured in the Umbrian manner This influence was as alive in Florence as it was in Urbino in the second half of the Quattrocento. It is perhaps most visible in the sloping roofs and tall spires, unusual elements in a Mediterranean landscape. The influence of Michelangelo is again evident in the well structured figure of the infant Christ. It was to become even more evident in the works which followed

33567-096portr.jpg	"Catalogue number: Bredius 279.This portrait of a young man on horseback was discovered by the great Rembrandt scholar and Director of the Mauritshuis, Abraham Bredius, in the castle at Dzikow in Galicia in 1897. In his notebook he describes the intense excitement with which he first viewed the painting at the end of a long day's travelling. Bredius always considered it to be his greatest discovery: it was shown in Amsterdam at the Rembrandt exhibition in the following year and in 1910 was sold to the steel magnate Henry Frick for the enormous sum of &#163;60,000. Since that time it has been one of the greatest treasures of the Frick Collection.The precise subject has been a matter of debate. It has been interpreted both as an allegorical portrait of the Christian knight defending Christendom against the infidel and as a portrait of one of the young Polish aristocrats who studied at Dutch universities in the seventeenth century. Certainly the joupane (a three-quarter length coat buttoned from neck to waist), cap, tight-fitting red trousers and calf length boots, and the swords, bows and arrows and war hammer, are more or less consistent with his being a Polish (or even Hungarian) horseman. The horse itself has a flying kutaz, possibly made from horsehair, attached to the bridle. The background is very broadly painted in dark tones and is difficult to read but behind the figure is a hill surmounted by a large circular, domed building.The problems surrounding the painting have been further deepened by the recent rejection of the attribution to Rembrandt by a senior member of the Rembrandt Research Project: an alternative attribution to Willem Drost has been proposed. There is nothing in the known oeuvre of Drost which possesses the imaginative power and bravura brushwork of The Polish Rider and the case for the reattribution of what is admittedly an unusual painting in Rembrandt's work must for the time being be considered unproven.Comment by a Polish visitor of the Web Gallery of Art: The old Polish title of this picture is ""Lisowczyk"". Lisowczyk (plural Lisowczyczy) is a soldier (mercenary) from light cavalry squad under the command of Alexander Lisowski. Lisowczyczy were undisciplined party of poor noblemen, outlaws and soldiers, hired by Polish kings. They were not regularly paid and they had licence to robber and plunder. Their name was synonymous of terror in 17th-century Europe. They were picturesque, because they did not wear uniforms but furs, silks and robbed jewellery"

19814-death_v.jpg	Signed on the censer: HANS. HOLPAIN.At the turn of the sixteenth century Hans Holbein the Elder, famous painter of altarpieces and portraits, was the leading painter of the rich merchant city of Augsburg. The painting in Budapest is one of his finest works and, indeed, one of the most significant works of German painting at that time. The inscription tells us that it was commissioned by Wolfgang Preu, Canon of Rottenbuch between 1490 and 1500 and that it originally decorated the tomb of the Preu family in the Church of St James at Straubing.The death of the Virgin is placed in a contemporary domestic setting. Mary, represented as a middle-class woman of Augsburg and wearing the clothes of the period, is seen lying on her canopied bed with the Apostles grouped about her like her family - one of them, wearing spectacles, is reading from the Bible. The artist follows the medieval tradition of simultaneous narration by depicting the sequel in the same picture: at the top we see the Virgin's soul, in the form of an innocent young girl in white, ascending to heaven to be received by God the Father.The Virgin Mary is seen surrounded by the apostles assembled, according to the Legenda Aurea, by divine miracle from various remote parts of the world for this solemn occasion. Though they cannot have met for a long time, they do not speak to one another; uncontestably the Virgin remains the centre of the scene. Every activity, every gesture of pain is directed towards her. She is seated in their midst, fragile and graceful, with a dreamy face - of all the faces in the picture hers shows the finest painting - and a halo around her head representing the supernatural element which is, however, hidden by a bonnet, a concession to wordly fashion. The picture is, indeed, marked by a mixture of accentuated verisimilar and supernatural elements. The young apostle-sitting before the bed, absorbed in reading and taking no part in the social gathering - who wears a kind of pince-nez in accordance with the customs of those days, is a veritable genre figure. The books lying on the bed, the censers and aspersorium painted with equally meticulous precision became ubiquitous pieces of the still-lifes of subsequent ages.In this painting Holbein, with exquisite taste and force, blends the traditional, late Gothic approach with a new style of representing nature and reality adopted from Netherlandish painting

31409-3adorat.jpg	The Adoration of the Shepherds on the end wall of the chapel presents idyllic scenery within a vast landscape and incorporates various secondary motifs. In the middle distance we see the annunciation to the shepherds, as a cluster of angels on a bank of cloud in front of the templelike stable sings of the birth of Christ. Of the many figures gathered in the foreground event of the adoration, the three shepherds stand out as being much too large, and with their crude, almost grimacing faces they are unlike anything else in Pinturicchio's repertoire of figures. They were inspired by the Portinari Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes. The Portinari Altarpiece and other imported works by Flemish masters had introduced the new style in Italy, however, no other Italian painter of his generation adopted its compositional principles so completely as did Pinturicchio

44091-3visitat.jpg	This small Visitation, probably intended as a single panel, is related to the Miraflores Altarpiece, not in subject but in style. Comparatively speaking, it is a narrative picture, showing a definite event in its appropriate surroundings. Shortly after the Annunciation, Mary visits her cousin Elisabeth, who despite her advanced age has miraculously become pregnant, and has been carrying the future John the Baptist for six months. The picture illustrates the circumstances of the meeting described in St. Luke's Gospel much more clearly than many other earlier depictions. For example, the landscape divided up by paths behind the Virgin Mary, from which she seems to be approaching small figures of people riding and walking indicate that it is passable - show that she has traveled a long way to visit her cousin. Elisabeth lives in hilly country, represented by the hill with the complex of fortress-like buildings outside which her husband Zacharias is playing with a dog. The open courtyard gateway, and even more so the path dynamically winding downward, show that the pregnant older woman has hurried respectfully to meet the young girl as Mary takes the last few steps. Each of them acknowledges the miracle of pregnancy and is laying a hand on the other's belly, while Elisabeth's outstretched arm and pale hand, shown against Mary's dark blue dress, leave us in no doubt which is the more important child. The gestures, at once tender and eloquent, are typical of Rogier's expressive style.The picture is also closely related to the version of the same subject on the right wing of the Annunciation Triptych (Galleria Sabauda, Turin) which is of the same width but considerably taller and thus makes a much narrower composition. The smaller version therefore appears less dramatic by comparison; Elisabeth's house does not tower over her so much. It is possible that an older design by Rogier was the model for both painting.These hands and facial types, the figures, and such features as the modeling of the forms resemble those of the Miraflores Altarpiece. Dendrochronology provides a useful lead to the date of the Visitation, for the wooden panel used comes from the same piece of timber as a part of the panels of the picture known as the Abegg Triptych (Riggisberg near Berne), which was painted in Rogier's workshop and can be dated to around 1445

17496-05virgin.jpg	This panel is one of Gossart's most intimate and charming renditions of the Virgin and Child. While the skilful presentation of the tactile qualities of flesh and fabrics had been previously mastered in Netherlandish painting, the utterly human relationship between the Virgin and Child is entirely new. It is the result of the influence of Italian Renaissance examples, such as Benedetto da Maiano's relief, which provides a close parallel not only in terms of the composition and poses of the figures but also in the motif of the Child tugging playfully on the Virgin's scarf.The Latin text at the upper curved edge (now barely visible), and the signature at the lower edge of the original frame are later additions

24035-0sposi4.jpg	The space of the room with a square plan (8,1 x 8,1 m) is essentially a cube, and in it Mantegna has created a monumental architectural reality by means of ribs on the ceiling connecting with pilasters on the walls, which are in turn supported by a marble socle. In the centre of the ceiling is the much-admired oculus, opening onto a painted sky. The interplay of levels of reality elaborates ideas already set forth in his art. Only the corbels are actually stone, the highly worked ribs, the garlands that encircle the eight busts of emperors supported by putti, and the ensembles in decorative lozenges are painted to simulate marble so convincingly that even the modern viewer is sometimes fooled. In the triangular spaces at the edges of the ceiling are twelve mythological scenes of Orpheus, Orion, and Hercules with backgrounds of simulated mosaics, a device that Raphael was to use in the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura. Only two of the walls have figurative narrations: the north wall with a scene that is usually called the Court and the west wall, divided into three scenes, Servants with Horse and Dogs, the Inscription with Putti, and the Meeting. The remaining two walls are painted with imitation leather draperies that encroach upon the other sides as well to create the fiction that there were curtains before all four walls and on two sides they had been opened up to reveal the events depicted.The central subject of the frescoes is Ludovico III Gonzaga, his wife, his children, and his court. A closed letter held by Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga in the Meeting seems to be the same one, now opened, that Ludovico, seated majestically, holds in the Court, and must be considered important for understanding the paintings. The style of the frescoes is similar to Mantegna's previous works. The compositions are dominated by the narrative elements, with the figures set frieze-like, close to the picture plane within a narrow spatial shelf in front of a landscape or architectural setting

31994-3tondo1.jpg	Four tondos with the Evangelists still adorn the pendentives that once supported the old cupola of the Cappella Capponi in the church of Santa Felicit&#224; in Florence. Except for the painting of St John, the precise authorship of the other three portraits has posed considerable problems for scholars. As Vasari only attributes two of the tondi to Bronzino, without specifying which, scholars are still divided over which and how many of them were painted by Bronzino, the apprentice to Pontormo. Probably Bronzino was responsible for the St Matthew with an intense gaze, half-closed mouth, and tousled red hair, painted with thickly laid-on and glowing brushstrokes and enlivened by the strong light that falls on the figure with a swirling crimson cloak, set against the dark background. Probably also Bronzino's is the St Mark with its palette of yellow and red tones contrasting with the green of the mantle wrapped around the figure, which looks as if it is peering through a window, an idea drawn from the Gospel.The bald St John with a long beard seems to share the same uneasy and sorrowful humanity lavished on the body of Christ in the Deposition by Pontormo in the same chapel, this tondo can certainly be attributed to Pontormo. St Luke is probably also a contribution by Pontormo.The figures of the Evangelists, with their distinctly Michelangiolesque flavour, have a vigour deriving from the way their heads are twisted and pushed forward. They are wrapped in ample robes, whose bold colours stand out against the dark backgrounds. This play of strong contrasts, which exalts the delicate outlines of the coloured surfaces, is in keeping with the refined style of the entire decoration of the chapel

10156-50relig2.jpg	Saint Maurice was an Egyptian, born in AD 250 in Thebes. He was the leader of the legendary Roman Theban Legion in the 3rd century, and one of the favourite and most widely venerated saints of that group. He was the patron saint of several professions, locales, and kingdoms. The cult of St Maurice, most widespread in the late Middle Ages, was first associated with the royal house of Burgundy and thereafter with Saxon and Ottonian kings. One of the main centres for the veneration of St Maurice was the eastern German city of Halle. From 1484 to 1503, during the rule of Archbishop Ernst of Wettin, the Moritzburg, the seat of the ruler, was built in Halle. Albrecht, Archbishop of Magdeburg, made the Moritzburg his main residence. He was a great patron of art, and from 1520 to 1525 he commissioned sixteen altarpieces from Lucas Cranach and his workshop; these exist today only in a fragmentary state.This panel was probably part of a multipanel altarpiece which in closed state could comprise four very narrow panels with two each for the right and left wings. The remainder of this altarpiece has not been identified and may no longer exist.The panel was executed with the contribution of the workshop. Its prototype was the Reliquary of St Maurice, known from an illustration in the Hallesches Heiltumsbuch.

Courbet could not reconstitute the entire scene in his studio for lack of space; there were simply too many ""walk-on parts"" to allow this. ""Fifty life-size figures, with a background of landscape and sky, on a canvas twenty feet wide and ten feet high,"" he proudly announced to Champfleury; this was the format customarily used for battle-scenes. In the Salon entry registers, Courbet noted that it was ""A picture of human figures, a historical record of a burial at Ornans."" He had some hesitations about how to place the cortege relative to the tomb, but the definitive composition showed a country burial at the moment of leave-taking.

19215-78notyma.jpg	This penetrating portrait is typical of Frans Hals.After 1641, Frans Hals never again employ any positive or vivid colour whatever in the accessories of his portraits, his flesh tones become much lower, and, above all, the flesh shadows duskier and tending to blackness. At first this last trait is not so strongly pronounced, but as we get farther onwards from the year 1641 the tendency increases, and in one or two extreme instances, such as the portrait of Tyman Oosdorp, flesh shadows are in places absolutely black.

41993-fortunet.jpg	Valentin's mature style of about 1630 was already slightly out of fashion, but it was at this time that he produced some of his best pictures. One of these is the Fortune Teller in the Louvre, a painting which belonged to Louis XIV. The artist has, as usual, concentrated on the low-life aspect of the subject - a gypsy telling fortunes to a hapless youth - yet the refinement of the tones and delicacy of the brushwork raise the painting above those of all his contemporaries in these respect. (The only Italian to achieve such refinement, although it was of a different character, was Gentileschi.

14812-madonna.jpg	Pere (Pedro) Garc�a, who came from Benabarra in Huesca, was active in Barcelona around 1455 and in L�rida around 1460. He is also mentioned in records dated 1479, but the date of this particular painting has been erased by time. His pictures display a felicitous blend of Flemish and Italian influences.His Madonna with Music-Making Angels is a worthy successor of Pere Serra's composition of similar theme which, in Pere Garc�a's time, was the central panel of the altar in Tortosa Cathedral. Representations of the Virgin and Child in the company of music-making angels were very popular at that time; in these two paintings even the fabric of the garments and the shape of the seat of the throne were similar. In fifteenth-century pictures the artist frequently introduced an area of floor with an ornate, chequered pattern, for this gave him a chance to show his craftsmanship. In paintings by the less talented artists the floor was usually depicted as if viewed from above but in Pere Garc�a's picture we can already perceive the Flemish influence at work; the painting reveals a degree of proficiency in the application of central perspective - a knowledge gained from Dalmau

19248-stillif7.jpg	Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Van der Hamen's style, like Sanchez Cotan's before him, was his cultivation of the illusion of three dimensional space. With an emphasis on formal purity, he has, in this still-life, subtly manipulated a series of forms (edibles and utensils) all derived from primary geometric shapes (circles, spheres and cylinders) and played these against the reticular articulation of the tablecloth and the receding rectangular tabletop. As a result of the powerful play of light and shadow on the creased damask cloth near the picture plane, and the subtle shading of the tabletop, a compelling 'arena' is established wherein the richly modelled forms can assume their maximum plasticity. The place of each form is firmly established by the strong, transparent shadows cast toward the right

37329-4orsini.jpg	"The altarpiece known as Passion Polyptych (or Orsini Polyptych), with panels now in a number of European museums (Angel of the Annunciation and Virgin of Annunciation, as well as Crucifixion and Deposition in Antwerp, the Road to Calvary in Paris and the Entombment in Berlin) is signed ""Pinxit Symon"" on the two panels of the Crucifixion and the Deposition. It presents several problems, both in terms of stylistic analysis and dating.Some scholars, stressing the fact that it is so different stylistically from all the other works of Simone's Avignon period (nervous lines and expressions), think that it may have been painted earlier and then transported to France; others believe that it may be a late work, commissioned by Napoleone Orsini, who died in the Curia in Avignon in 1342.

The enthusiasm for lithographs and engravings that had arisen in the thirties revived again in the fifties, and all the landscapes showing the Hungarian scenery are charged with renewed patriotism and love of nature. The atmosphere is therefore all the more gloomy, as the bitter memory of 1848 and the suppression that followed lent bitter sentiment to landscapes, too.

37490-houndsbo.jpg	Dog portraiture began in France at the court of Louis XV, who commissioned portraits of his favourite houndshunting scenes of Frans Snyders. In England, where the emphasis in hunting was increasingly being placed upon the performance of individual hounds, which led to intense rivalry among the landed elite, this was reflected in the paintings of John Wootton and Peter Tillemans; the former of whom in particular started to produce portraits of dogs in the mid eighteenth century. Fine examples of Wootton's work in this manner include the mock heroic portrait of Horace Walpole&#146;s favourite dog Patapan, painted in 1743. However, it was Stubbs, a generation later, who really developed the genre, working, as he was, at a time when dogs were becoming increasingly valued not only as sporting trophies, but as objects of interest in themselves. By the late eighteenth century, the dog had gained a new status as a prized possession within English households which it had not formerly enjoyed. Stubbs's highly sensitive paintings of these animals are executed with infinite attention to detail and are possessed with boundless character and charm. Whilst they are seldom uninteresting as paintings, at their best they are small masterpieces.The landscape in the present painting was painted by Jan Wildens

30734-jousse.jpg	Perronneau studied engraving with Laurent Cars and then painting with Natoire. He was accepted by the Acad�mie Royale in 1746 and became a full member 1753. But his rivalry with the pastellist Quentin de La Tour led him to seek a clientele outside Paris, especially it seems in Orl�ans. He painted mostly the senior officials, and the upper bourgeoisie, engineers, doctors and clergy. On the other hand he seems to have been particularly favoured and respected by his own colleagues, and painted portraits of Gilequian, Drouais and Oudry and of the engravers Cars and Huquier, the sculptor Adam the elder, the architects Chevotet and Soyer. His strong firm almost coarse (and maybe rather less flattering) style may have been appreciated better by these connoisseurs than the slightly slicker and more perfectionist style of La Tour, who seems to have gone out of his way to sabotage the career of this younger artist.There is a group of thirteen portraits in the Mus�e des Beaux-Arts d'Orl�ans, among them the portrait of Daniel Jousse (1704-1781), a famous legal expert who published about twenty volumes on criminal law

35464-03mythol.jpg	The subject of the painting is a legend according to which Leander, a youth of Abydos, a town on the Asian shore of the Hellespont, used to swim across the waters at night to Sestos on the opposite side to meet his lover Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite. She would guide him by holding up a lighted torch. One stormy night Leander was drowned. Hero in despair threw herself into the sea. The story is related in this form by the Greek poet Musaeus (4th-5th century A.D.). Ovid (Heroides, 18, 19) tells of the lovers, omitting their death. The theme is found in Italian and Netherlandish painting, especially of the 17th century which depicts Leander swimming the Hellespont towards a distant tower lighted by Hero; or the drowned Leander is borne away by Nereids as Hero plunges to her death into the sea.Rubens gives additional intensity to the story by combining consecutive events to produce one highly dramatic scene: the death of Leander, the way his pale, lifeless body is accompanied by thirteen nereids through the churning waves, and finally Hero's plunge into the depth. The subject of Rubens's composition is, in fact, the human body in extremes of movements.The Hero and Leander was painted during Rubens's second stay at the court of Mantua, where he worked from the middle of 1604 until the end of 1605 for Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga. It belongs to a group of at least five paintings that were evidently painted at this time for the free market, without any definite client. The common feature of these works lies in their portrayal of historical scenes with large number of figures, which allowed Rubens to depict powerfully moving bodies in  extreme perspectives. The works show the influence on the young Rubens of Michelangelo and Caravaggio, and also in the particular case of Hero and Leander of Leonardo and Tintoretto.There is a smaller version of this painting in the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven

02508-6elem4.jpg	The painting is one of the series representing the Four Elements. From the series, Fire and Water are in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Earth is now in a Viennese private collection. Air has been lost and only exists in copies.Water is composed of a multitude of aquatic animals. (The listing of the aquatic animals contains 62 species.) The unusual multitude of species here is astonishing, as well as the inclusion of invertebrates, not only of the snail and the crab, but also of worms. On the other hand, common edible fish are missing.In this composition Arcimboldo gave no consideration to the relationship of sizes among the individual animals, as can be seen by comparing the large seahorse with the comparatively small seal.

09667-1stufa5.jpg	"The picture shows one of the scenes in the Stanza della Stufa. The Stanza della Stufa is a smaller room on the piano nobile that was one of the grand duke's private chambers. It took its name from its heated floor (""stufa"" means heater). Cortona painted here the Age of Gold and the Age of Silver on the north wall in 1637. The Age of Bronze and Age of Iron were realized only later in 1641. The iconographic concept is based on Ovid's Metamorphoses.Pietro da Cortona was the Baroque artist 'par excellence' in Rome. His light colouring and the joy of life make one think of Rubens in such works as the Golden Age in the Stanza della Stufa of Palazzo Pitti, Florence.This illustration to Ovid's vision of a pure and innocent classical paradise alludes to the era of Ferdinando II's rule and to the union of his House of Medici with that of the Della Rovere family, which occurred the same year this fresco was commissioned and executed"

34453-09rippl.jpg	"Whistler who was living  in Paris in the 1890s influenced Rippl's art. Later Rippl wrote in his ""Memoirs"",  that he made the longish form of artists fashionable and women or men in black or grey clothes  either sitting or standing  in  an elegant way. The picture belongs to a group of pictures which have one figure only and a symbolic interior  (e.g. ""Woman in White Spotted Dress"", 1889, ""Woman with Cage"",1892, ""Slim Woman with Vase"", 1892, ""Mother"", 1894, etc.). The picture is suggestive of  old age and loneliness. The everyday clothes of the woman  and the bunch of violets  symbolizing mortality raise the picture to the sphere of lyric, subjective and intimate. A world of intimate interiors dominates the art of Nabis, a group of  French painters, too. In the grey and undefined space behind the model, the fireplace is the only sign of an interior. Colours  of  the background are subdued: blue, ockre, olive green, brick-red and purple. Contours typical of  art nouveau  and silhouettes with plasticity inside them are accompanied by  realism which is brought about by brush strokes following  shapes, and shades expressing shadows. Wrinkles on the face are also delicately blurred"
