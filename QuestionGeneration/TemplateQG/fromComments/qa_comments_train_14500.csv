42802-3annunc2.jpg	The Chapel of Our Lady of the Rosary was destroyed by fire in 1867. The restored chapel was reopened only in 1959. In the new carved ceiling of the nave, three oval paintings by Veronese, which were once in the deconsecrated church of the Umilt&#224; on the Zattere, were inset: the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Assumption, and the Annunciation. They are works of very high chromatic quality and great inventiveness of composition, and can be considered to be on the same level as the scenes he painted for the ceiling of the nave in San Sebastiano

The entire method of painting is considerably more detailed than in Titian's own Prado portrait of Philip, so it is thought that this portrait was painted by an associate of Titian's from north of the Alps.

38313-christ_s.jpg	This picture is based on the story in the Gospel of St Luke (VII, 36-50) in which Christ was invited to dine with Simon the Pharisee. The painting is directly linked with a large composition at the Louvre in Paris, which Subleyras painted in Rome from about 1755 to 1757 for the refectory of Santa Maria Nuova, a monastery in Asti, Piedmont. This work was chiefly responsible for his fame during the eighteenth century. He made many studies prior to embarking on the picture. Even while working on it he made a number of small versions, including this painting, which should be regarded as a work in its own right.

26071-20noyoun.jpg	The vision of man and the world free from the transcendental conception of the Middle Ages achieved on the threshold of the fifteenth century in Tuscany through the laws of linear perspective, was reached almost at the same time in Flanders in an empirical fashion through the continuous lyrical modulation of light which, embracing form and space in a unified synthesis, brings out the natural value and weight of colours. This is the background to the intimate, contemplative, natural quality of the painting of Hans Memling, an excellent example of which is the 'Portrait of a Young Man'. The light gently explores the features of the human face and of landscape and evokes each detail with incomparable naturalness

The composition and execution of this poorly preserved fresco are poorer than in the other pictures in the chapel. In its solemn character the scene is comparable with the considerably better Obsequies in the Saint Fina and the Sassetti chapels. Mary's body is lying on a bier in an open space, mourned by the grieving Apostles. Four angels are carrying long candles or palm leaves. The dead Mary's pale face is old, her cheeks sunken.

09494-rochecho.jpg	"While its attribution is not undisputed, this portrait is closely related to a group of miniature-like portraits ascribed to Corneille. Typical features include the neutral, somewhat iridescent grey-green background and the slight turn in the upper body and head, whose connection to the plane is re-established by the fall of the veil.The cool, distanced expression on the noblewoman's face, the precise drawing of her eyes, nose and lips, and the smooth planes of her forehead and cheeks assign this panel to the sphere of French court painting. Yet there is a contradiction in the loving execution of the details of her clothes. Are we seeing here a  reflection of the artist's Netherlandish heritage (Corneille de Lyon was born in The Hague)? This tendency towards ""detail realism"" nevertheless draws upon new technical means. The pale, puffy elements protruding from the sleeves of the dark dress are daubed on in an ""Impressionistic"" style, richly modulated and without clear boundaries.Was the artist, whose work is still surrounded by many unanswered questions, familiar with Venetian painting? Whatever the case, a contemporary source tells us that Corneille painted the entire court and that he rose to become ""Peintre et Valet de Chambre du Roi"", the highest post that a painter could attain at court"

29220-05nunzia.jpg	The iconographic and formal culmination of the Mary cycle in the Nunziatella is the grandiose Assumption on the ceiling of the nave. This subject had a special meaning for the Jesuits, who saw the Protestants' refusal of Mary worship as a key issue in their propagation of the faith. De Mura depicted Mary being received in heaven by the Holy Trinity, and not simply her rising upward supported by angel, the image that had dominated ceiling painting since Correggio's cupola in Parma.The rapport between the framed and framing elements, altogether independent of the architectural situation, gives this ceiling a distinctly ornamental character. Along with the caps of the vault and the simulated oval openings, the framing of the side cartouches composed of C-shaped elements and the sculptural forms of the frames around the niches form a dynamic, airy system of positive and negative shapes radiating outward from the centre ceiling

33577-106portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 327.Rembrandt conceived this portrait of a man and the Portrait of a Lady with an Ostrich-Feather Fan (also in Washington) as pendants, or companion pieces. In both, light illuminates the subjects from exactly the same angle. The sitters interact with restrained yet poignant warmth; he gestures toward her while looking at the viewer, and she glances in his direction while holding her feather fan so that it inclines toward him.The painting is in poor condition and has been significantly overpainted several times, once probably in the nineteenth century

13027-villiers.jpg	George Villiers, 1st duke of Buckingham, also called Sir George Villiers,  (1592-1628), was a royal favourite and statesman who virtually ruled England during the last years of King James I and the first years of the reign of Charles I. He was extremely unpopular, and the failure of his aggressive, erratic foreign policy increased the tensions that eventually exploded in the Civil War between the royalists and the parliamentarians			
07164-canal205.jpg	This is one of the largest canvases Canaletto ever painted. It shows the view from the first floor of Palazzo Garzoni on the Grand Canal at the corner of Rio di Sant'Angelo. To the left, on the opposite side of the water, is the entrance to the Rio di San Polo, with Palazzo Barbarigo della Terrazza in the lefthand corner and behind it the steeple of San Polo. At the end of the row of faï¿½ades in the distance is the Rialto Bridge and, on the far right, the corner of Palazzo Corner Spinelli and the entrance to the Rio di Sant'Angelo.There are many gondolas on the water, busily crossing the Grand Canal and, in one case, nearly colliding with a rowboat. Directly in front of Palazzo Corner Spinelli lies a cluster of barges of various kinds, tied together for lack of space to dock; the narrow quay on the right is apparently reserved for gondolas. The northwestern light is pale and damp; the sky seems to be clearing after a rainy afternoon.It would still be possible to enjoy this view, were it not for the fact that there are two views involved. The right half of the composition was taken from the northeastern corner window of Palazzo Garzoni, the left half from that in the northwestern one. Canaletto must have made two preparatory drawings and then combined them in one composition, with the result that the picture encompasses an angle of almost ninety degrees.Various features of this picture are arranged like the lighting and props in an operatic production, in order to create a compelling rather than simply descriptive image. These features perhaps refer to Canaletto's early experience in the theatre. The ominous sky provides an element of menace and restlessness rare in his work, and the unlikely grouping of boats in the right foreground seem to have been placed for picturesque, rather than a realistic, effect

28755-0granvell.jpg	Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle (1517-1586), minister of King  Philip II of Spain; he played a major role in the early stages of the Netherlands' revolt against Philip's rule.Granvelle, educated at Padua and at Louvain, was ordained priest and, in 1540, consecrated bishop of Arras. Pope Pius IV made him archbishop of Malines (1560) and cardinal (1561). In 1560 Philip II appointed Granvelle chief counselor to Margaret of Austria, regent in the Netherlands. His monarchism led him to clash with the Dutch leaders, Prince William the Silent and the counts of Egmont and Hoorn, all of whom opposed Philip's policy of converting the Netherlands into a Spanish dependency, and the Dutch leaders eventually effected Philip's removal of Granvelle (1564). Later Philip concluded that the Netherlands revolution never would have developed had he supported Granvelle.From 1565 to 1579 Granvelle served in Italy as viceroy of Naples (1571-75) and as president of the Council for Italy (1575-79). In 1579 Philip appointed him secretary of state (Spain), in which capacity he campaigned against William and the Dutch Protestants and negotiated the union of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns

08990-05ursula.jpg	The painting was executed in Rome for Cardinal Poli. It depicts the scene when Ursula (with a red-cross flag and an arrow symbolizing her future martyrdom) and her retinue depart for Cologne.This picture is entirely concerned with the phenomenon of light; the golden tone fills the whole surface and envelops each of the individual elements. The actual subject, St Ursula embarking with her retinue of virgins, seems lost in this paean of praise for the sun, which shines directly at the spectator from the middle of the canvas. In this picture Claude perfectly observed an effect which eluded most painters before the nineteenth century - the convincing depiction of direct sunlight. He was the first artist ever to dare the daunting task of depicting a direct view into the sun. Few of Claude's pictures go as far as this one, as he usually preferred to portray the softer light of early morning or late evening.The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 54)

11167-1870s_67.jpg	Although the dancers appear to be casually observed, the composition was meticulously worked out. The artist's fascination with form and structure is reflected in the analogy between the watering can (used to wet down the dust on the studio floor) and the dancer at the right. The handle on the side imitates her left arm, the handle at the top mimics her head, and the spout approximates her right arm and raised leg. Later in life Degas regretted this visual joke and wished to paint out the can, but the owner of the canvas, a friend of the artist, refused to allow Degas to retouch it

04789-xantippe.jpg	This painting was formerly ascribed to Jan Victors, the Caesar van Everdingen. Its attribution changed very recently to Reyer van Blommendael.The theme of this picture is unique in painting. The philosopher Socrates sits on the right on two steps that form a horizontal stone 'entrance' to the scene. This is a common device in work by the Haarlem classicists from after 1625. The shabbily dressed Socrates wears rags wrapped around his legs and secured with pieces of string Socrates can be identified by his irregular features and his motto which is carved in Greek letters on the stone slab on which he leans. He pays no heed whatsoever as his wife Xantippe scolds him and proceeds to empty the contents of a vessel over his head.Van Blommendael was probably influenced by a print depicting the same subject by Otto van Veen in 1606. An earlier illustration of a woman humiliating her husband by dousing him with the content of a vessel can be found in Dï¿½rer's painting of Job and His Wife from c. 1504

24964-0view1.jpg	The citadel at Manta was erected in the 1300s at a strategic point in what was once the border region between the marquessate of Saluzzo and the duchy of Savoy. The house of del Vasto ruled here from 1091 to 1601. The paintings of the Great Hall (Sala Baronale) on the second floor were commissioned by Valerano Bastardo di Saluzzo (c. 1375-1443).The room contains two picture cycles, the Fountain of Youth and the Nine Heroes and Nine Heroines, one across from the other. The frieze-like sequence of scenes with the Fountain of Youth in the centre is on the long south wall. The second frieze fills the north wall, and like the other cycle, it overlaps the two end walls. Its  first and last pairs of figures appear on the west and east walls, respectively.Until the 1960s the frescoes were attributed to the Avignon painter Jacques Iverny. Then the attribution was changed to the Turin court painter Giacomo Jaquerio (c. 1380-1453). However, both attributions were questioned by later scholars and at present we can speak of the painter as simply the Master of the Castello della Manta

30960-entry_ru.jpg	In 1809 Franz Pforr from Frankfurt and Friedrich Overbeck from Lï¿½beck founded the first association of artists in the modern sense in Vienna, the St Luke's Brotherhood. It was established in opposition to the schematic historicism of the Vienna Academy, which was then the foremost institution of its kind under its director, the Neoclassical Heinrich Fï¿½ger. The members of the association were all patriotic, swore by the art of the old German masters, and wore their hair long under a beret. They wanted to live Spartan lives like monks, and undertook to sustain religious morals. While he was still in Vienna, Pforr  examples of the new school, created one of the most remarkable The Entry of Emperor Rudolf of Habsburg into Basel.This painting is the first large medieval subject painted in a deliberately historicist manner. Its flattened perspectives, awkward figures and bright colours are all calculated to achieve an effect of child-like innocence and naivetï¿½. The work reflects the artist's nostalgia for a proud period of Germanic unity under the Holy Roman Empire and his admiration for the first monarch of the Habsburg dynasty to be elected Emperor

The panel containing the scenes is situated in the bottom row of the right side of the main section.The rule of absolute autonomy being given to each single scene is successfully broken in this panel. The two episodes, told by John, occur simultaneously but in different places and the stairs, a material link in space, also connect the time-factor. While Jesus is brought before the High Priest Annas, Peter remains in the courtyard where a servant-girl recognizes him as a friend of the accused: his raised hand indicates the words of denial.The surroundings are full of vivid architectural detail: the doorway with a pointed arch opening onto the room with a porch, the Gothic window of the small balcony, the pilaster strips on the back wall of the upper floor and the coffered ceiling, this time with smaller squares. Peter, whose halo in a curious fashion includes the head and shoulders of the person next to him, is warming his feet at the fire in a highly realistic manner. Lastly, because of her vertical position and arm resting on the handrail, the figure of the serving-maid about to go up the stairs was evidently the cause of much indecision since several ""changes of mind"" have been discovered around the skirt"

23319-2trescor.jpg	Battista Suardi was a member of a leading Bergamasque family. He was Lotto's patron in Trescore where he had built the oratory in 1501-02, and soon afterward had had the east wall, with its semicircular apse accommodating the altar, decorated by an anonymous and modestly gifted local painter. Lotto's task was to paint the other three walls, and the areas of ceiling between the exposed wooden beams that supported the roof.Except for the framing arch of the apse and a dado molding running round the room at head height, the simple interior had no architectural articulation. Lotto divided the west and south walls into two main horizontal zones by adding fictive moldings, illusionistically designed to match the real one. He filled the upper frieze-like zone with a series of roundels containing alternating figures of prophets and sibyls, who look and lean out of their porthole-like frames and gesticulate energetically to one another, as if across the real space of the chapel. In the main zone Lotto created vertical subdivisions by putting in fictive pilasters, and, on the south wall, by using the two tall narrow windows.This view shows the entrance side (south wall) and end wall in the rear. The various narrative scenes on the long entrance wall, depicted on a large scale in the foreground and a small scale in the landscape beyond, represent episodes from the life of St Brigid, an Irish nun venerated for her charitable activity on behalf of the poor and sick and, most appropriate in the context of the rural community of Trescore, as a protector of crops and farm animals against natural disasters. Thus, in the central section next to and above the doorway, the saint in her distinctive yellow habit is presented four times: in the left foreground she gives food (raw meat, which miraculously has failed to mark her habit) and drink (water miraculously transformed into beer) to two peasant women; to the right, she heals a blind man; in the left background she saves a flock of sheep from a wild boar; and in the right background she halts the advance of a devastating storm.The scenes of the martyrdom of St Catherine of Alexandria and the communion of St Mary Magdalene are on the short wall (the west wall) opposite the altar. These scenes establish close parallel to motifs in the Barbara cycle: like Barbara, Catherine is beheaded; in both cases people are being burned nearby

08406-humility.jpg	This painting combines skill in the portrayal of figures with a complete disregard for spatial perspective and a medieval subject. Iconographically it combines a pantocrator (the mystical mandorla with Christ at the centre, surrounded by angels) with the Holy Spirit, with the Virgin and Child surrounded by the twelve Apostles and a heavenly choir of angels.The figures are executed in a naturalistic fashion, in proportion and with a sense of three-dimensionality. The space, on the other hand, is resolved in a conventional manner. For this reason we might describe this artist as one who has assimilated the formal techniques of naturalistic representation, but whose art still remains tied to the medieval past in its thematic material and composition

09576-corot25.jpg	This painting is probably a portrait of one of Corot's friends visiting his studio which can be identified by the landscape of France and the view of Italy on the wall. But the painting is first and foremost a pure exercise in painterly skills, with the red tip of the fan set off against the blue fabric of the dress, and the cushions contrasting the luminous flesh of the woman's arm, with a slanting line formed by the leg of the easel enhancing the subtle balance of horizontals and verticals

24758-virgchil.jpg	This master takes his name from his favoured depiction of a variety of female figures in a half-length and small scale format. Typically these included representations of aristocratic young women reading, writing or playing musical instruments, extended often to include depictions of Mary Magdalene. The present work is characteristic of his representations of the Virgin and Child, which are frequently shown against a neutral background, often with a table in the foreground supporting the Christ Child and an open book. The motif of the Virgin handing fruit to her Son is also to be found in other compositions of this type. The relatively large number of related works grouped under this Master's name would suggest that they were in some part the product of a workshop, most probably located in Antwerp, rather than all by the same hand

30460-virgin_c.jpg	The painting depicts the Virgin and Child before a pink granite ledge, an extensive mountainous landscape beyond. The composition, while individual, is reminiscent of Cima's Virgin and Child before a Landscape at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, with which Pasqualino would doubtless have been acquainted.  The position of the Madonna here, the inclination of her head, the grip of her right hand and the Christ Child's left foot, planted firmly on his mother's knee, all recall Cima's earlier invention.  In keeping with Bellinian convention, the Madonna and Child are positioned behind a parapet, accentuating their elevated status in contrast to their viewer. Between graceful fingers, the Madonna holds a small quince, symbolizing rebirth and renewal, and a prophetic sign of Christ's sacrifice and resurrection.The panel is signed on the ledge, lower centre: PASVALINVS V P (NV in ligature)

24659-becket.jpg	The picture shows a detail of the St Thomas Altarpiece.Master Francke was a German painter. His major surviving work is the altarpiece for the guild of merchants trading with England, showing Passion scenes and incidents from the life of St Thomas &#224; Becket. The surviving panels of the St Thomas &#224; Becket Altar are characterized above all by the graphic vividness with which the soldiers are depicted, the barrenness of the rocky landscape, and the powerful overlapping with which Francke lends his narratives a whole new sense of drama. The red ground studded with gold stars is already familiar to us from the Master of Trebon. As appropriate to its theme, the Nativity is the most lyrical and tender panel of the altar. Despite its gracefulness and its predominantly pale skin tone, typical of the day, Mary's head is relatively broad and heavy. Contributing in no small way to the popularity of the altar was the extraordinarily rich and gentle, almost park-like landscape present in the surviving panels; the fore- ground, however, is here sandy, bare and unwelcoming

21835-mazzini.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.The painters of the Macchiaioli were familiar with the liberal, but romantically religious ideas of Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-1872), the leading ideologue of the Italian national movement. His liberal ideas, influenced by French socialism and by positivism, had a real impact on the revolutionary movement. Silvestro Lega painted Giuseppe Mazzini on his Death Bed, recording the passing of a giant in one of Macchiaioli's finest achievements. The dying man is seen almost life-size. He is resting on two pillows and seems no longer aware of what may be going on around him. The cool colours highlight the solemnity and sadness of the mood

10012-herdemo2.jpg	This painting and its companion piece, Sorrowful Heraclitus, depict two men with diametrically opposed views of the world. The subjects of the paintings are the Greek philosophers Democritus of Abdera and Heraclitus of Ephesus.  Their views of life could not have been more different:  Democritus never stopped laughing at the follies of humankind while Heraclitus wept continuously over the condition of the world. There are numerous representations of them in Greek and Roman art and literature, but the theme fell out of favour in post-classical art and was not revived until the late 15th century. By about 1600 Democritus and Heraclitus once again became a popular subject, particularly in the Netherlands, and the philosophers are depicted either in pairs or a single composition.

22775-virgin_c.jpg	In this panel influence of Leonardo clearly visible in the figure and compositional types. The style of the present work is entirely consistent with other paintings produced by Llanos during his stay in Murcia from 1514-16, by which date his collaboration with Fernando Ya&#241;ez had come to an end and both painters had begun to develop their own divergent styles. Often to be found in works of this date is the repetition of a motif or type found in the great altarpiece in Valencia and in this sense the present work is no exception; the pose and drapery of the upper half of the Virgin echoes that in the Rest on the Flight into Egypt

35498-28mythol.jpg	The lyricism, eloquence and sensuality that characterise his entire oeuvre are already apparent in Rubens' mythological compositions of 1600-1620. These are often vigorous, earthy works, such as the Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus.The two daughters of King Leucippus were betrothed to a set of twins, cousins of Castor and Pollux. But the latter pair carried the maidens off and had sons by them. Armed warriors are seen in the act of seizing the naked maidens and bearing them away on horseback.The composition of this painting opens upward like the flowering of a bouquet. The two divergent diagonals rise from the base of the painting, where the feet of captive and aggressor are placed side by side. The volumes ascend from this point, harmoniously residing on successive points of equilibrium, while the luminous white forms of the nude victims contrast with the tanned, caparisoned bodies of their hirsute rapists. Here Rubens' classicising and Baroque tendencies are completely reconciled.

While her contemporaries appeared timid and docile, she was a self-assured woman. She is seated at her desk in a dignified pose; the writing utensils indicate that her interest went beyond the narrow limits of family life. She learnt to paint from Amerling; she was an excellent pianist, as well as a composer of music. Her salon was frequented by musicians and painters, including Richard Wagner and Franz Liszt. Amerling did not disguise the countess's magnetic, matured womanliness. By including personal objects and the dog nuzzling to its mistress, in the grandiose composition, Amerling created a portrait which is near to genre painting

The scattered accents of colour, such as red, seem to act as a counterpoint to her balanced pose. The harp and part of the stone socle may be intended as bearers of elegiac atmosphere, but first and foremost they are stabilizing compositional elements. Sentimentality and Neoclassicism are found hand in hand here. A clear and stringent compositional architecture is hidden behind an air of dreamy softness. The concept of the experienced portraitist is cloaked in the guise of chance inspiration

25195-holy_fam.jpg	The small-size panel obviously intended not for any church but for private devotions in the intimate milieu of a sitting-room is much like a miniature, offering to give pleasure when contemplated at close quarters. The waves of the hair - that of the Virgin undulating softly, that of Joseph more roughly in an elderly manner, the rich golden locks of the Child curling into ringlets - the objects arranged in the foreground to recall a still-life, the carefully delineated veins of the marble balustrade, all evidence this attitude. The faces, particularly that of the Virgin, are definitely of the Dutch type. The colours are gentle, melting into unassuming harmony, the forms are tranquil. The background recalling a goldsmith's work, decorated with pearls and precious stones, greatly contributes to this closed character. Apparently the picture is one of the artist's earliest works, from a youthful period, when the Baroque forms, which later became a fundamental trait of his art, had not yet become dominant

35832-river_sc.jpg	In this painting the formation of trees and bushes on the bank almost seems to rise as a mirage from the motionless water. The whole picture, which is without a sharply drawn line, is a modulation within an almost monochromatic scale; while staying in the same greyish key, this monochromatism is only subtly adjusted towards the sky, where it acquires a bluish tinge, or towards the water with hints of blue and brown, while in the foliage on the bank a greenish grey predominates. In a distant haze the horizon is only vaguely discernible, which makes this calm picture into a harmony of air and water in which the shore, gently receding until it is lost to the eye, delineates a deep, wide space.So refined and delicate is this painting that one feels that it must be something more than a sensitive approximation to a real view along the bank of a Dutch river, early on a cool summer morning before the wind has blown the mist away.

44792-stigmata.jpg	Zurbaran was born in a village in the Spanish province of Badajoz and became one of the most important artists of the Seville school. During the 17th century Seville was one of the most active artistic centres in Spain and was also the birthplace of Velï¿½zquez and Murillo. Zurbaran's naturalism brought him, around 1630, numerous commissions from throughout Andalusia. His austere, simple style was particularly suitable for transmitting the spirit and message of the Counter-Reformation, which called for a return to a pure and ascetic religiosity. His religious paintings combine the mystical nature of the subject with a profound sense of humanity in accordance with the renewed precepts of the faith

35444-75religi.jpg	This painting was commissioned in 1634 for the high altar of the Abbey of Affligem, then one of the most important monasteries in the Low Countries. Tensions inside the monastery may explain why this monumental work was not delivered until 1637.In this production of his mature period, Rubens masterfully combines two artistic traditions. The first of these is that of the large single-frame altarpieces that were to replace the older polyptychs in the Southern Low Countries in the 17th century. With their exceptional scale and their strongly vertical format, they faced artists with the problem of constructing a convincing compositional unity from a series of related themes in a vertical format. As an artist gifted with one of the greatest compositional and narrative talents of his age, Rubens fulfilled his task masterfully. Instead of dividing the painting into an upper and lower register, a solution that he had often applied following Titian, he elects here to represent Christ's ascension to the place of his execution on Calvary in an uninterrupted zigzag movement. The thrust from below to above is achieved both in the colouring, with a balanced rhythm of localised concentrations of colour, and also iconographically, with the successive tableaux of the executioners with the two thieves, the holy women with Mary and Veronica, and ending with the Roman officers on horseback with their flapping pennants.The centre-point of the composition is Christ's face that St Veronica is wiping. Turned towards the viewer, it forms a direct call to the faithful to follow his life and to think on their own sins that had to be redeemed by Christ's suffering. This procedure descends directly from the tradition of devotional art, with small-scale pictures intended for individual meditation. The genius of Rubens' invention lies precisely in the combination of the two pictorial traditions, breathing new life into the ancient devotional tradition within a contemporary, counter-reformation form of altar decoration, whilst at the same time enriching the broad, sweeping movement of such a monumental high altarpiece with the more intimate emotionality of smaller devotional paintings

Now, however, the crowd of figures gathered around the three crosses is sparser and the view of Christ on the cross at full height is unobstructed.

20016-orpheus.jpg	Orpheus is a legendary Thracian poet, famous for his skill with the lyre. He married Eurydice, a wood nymph, and at her death descended into the underworld in an unsuccessful attempt to bring her back to earth.Such was his musical skill that Orpheus charmed not only the wild beasts but also the trees and rocks which would come after him at the sound of his lyre. He sits under a tree plucking the lyre (in the background, barely seen in the reproduction), animals of many kinds, wild and domestic are gathered peacefully round him.You can view other depictions of Orpheus taming the animals.

The Senate commissioned the great architect Andrea Palladio to design it. Construction began in May 1577. The building was in a satisfactory stage and was consecrated in 1592.

29994-partridg.jpg	By the time this picture was painted in 1725, Oudry had already been a member of the Acadï¿½mie Royale for six years. He was well established and much sought after, and enjoyed a healthy rivalry with the older Franï¿½ois Desportes.Dog portraiture began in France at the court of Louis XV, who commissioned portraits of his favourite houndshunting scenes of Frans Snyders. In England, where the emphasis in hunting was increasingly being placed upon the performance of individual hounds, which led to intense rivalry among the landed elite, this was reflected in the paintings of John Wootton and Peter Tillemans; the former of whom in particular started to produce portraits of dogs in the mid eighteenth century. Fine examples of Wootton's work in this manner include the mock heroic portrait of Horace Walpole&#146;s favourite dog Patapan, painted in 1743. However, it was Stubbs, a generation later, who really developed the genre, working, as he was, at a time when dogs were becoming increasingly valued not only as sporting trophies, but as objects of interest in themselves. By the late eighteenth century, the dog had gained a new status as a prized possession within English households which it had not formerly enjoyed. Stubbs's highly sensitive paintings of these animals are executed with infinite attention to detail and are possessed with boundless character and charm. Whilst they are seldom uninteresting as paintings, at their best they are small masterpieces

28768-7goltziu.jpg	The model is painted in three-quarter profile against a neutral background. His clothing is austere: a black pourpoint, a rose-purple gown and a small neck-ruff. Turning to the right, he possesses a certain natural authority. His face, with its lively and immediate brushwork, exudes an extraordinary presence, fixing the viewer directly with a penetrating, slightly worried look. We are in front of an intimate portrait, disturbed only slightly by a Latin inscription. Added later, this has the merit of identifying both the subject and the painter. The former is Hubert Goltzius, the latter Anthonis Mor, a painter attached to the service of Philip II.Uncle of the famous Hendrick Goltzius and a pupil of Lambert Lombard from Li&#234;ge, Goltzius was a painter, engraver and humanist. Thanks to his Bruges patron Marcus Laurinus, a passionate student of archaeology, he was able to publish several works on ancient history and numismatics, a subject very popular among scholars and collectors of the time. It is precisely the publication of one of his books that is said to lie at the origin of the painting represented here. According to the biographer Van Mander, Mor proposed painting it for the scholar to thank him for the gift of a copy of his treatise Caesar Augustus, published in January 1574. By a happy coincidence, this work, carrying Goltzius' dedication, is currently conserved in the Museum's library.This portrait of the numismatist is one of Mor's last paintings. With its strong sense of humanity it stands out against the rest of his oeuvre, consisting essentially of dignified official portraits, often of princes and aristocrats from various European courts. The painter applied all his skill to this work, capturing his model's facial expression with a few key features in a single sitting. Indeed, Mor is said to have painted it on the spur of the moment, in under an hour, without study or preliminary drawing, after a breakfast with his friend Goltzius. On 24 February 1574 the humanist wrote to Abraham Ortelius that he intended using the painting to illustrate one of his next editions. In this way, the effigy appears as an engraving in Sicilia et Magna Graecia, which came off the press in 1576, framed with the same inscription as the painting

08117-pearlnec.jpg	This is one of the several theater scenes which Cassatt painted in the late 1870s. The woman in the painting is probably Lydia, Cassatt's sister. The painting demonstrates the influence of Edgar Degas, the artist's friend. It was shown in 1879 at the 4th Impressionist exhibition held in Paris.The painting is a delight both for its leisurely brushwork and for its spatial construction. Without defining any middle distance, Cassatt places the figure squarely up front, while the mirror in which we see her back reflected (which at first glance seems a background of gallery seats) actually shows us what Lydia herself sees before her. Beside that of Degas we may detect Manet's influence, namely that of A Bar at the Folies-Bergï¿½re

32787-25drago2.jpg	In a bleak landscape with the silhouette of a burning city in the distance, Michael has just forced the Devil to the ground and is about to kill him with a blow from his sword. The monsters crawling out from all sides are reminiscent of those created by Hieronymus Bosch, while the figures in the centre recall those from the Inferno of Dante's epic poem the Divine Comedy. On the left are the hypocrites in leaden coats, condemned to follow their torturous path, while on the right are the thieves being tormented by serpents.The St Michael and St George and the Dragon in the Louvre, and the St George of the National Gallery in Washington are bound together both by their subject - an armed youth fighting a dragon - and by stylistic elements. All three are assigned to the Florentine period and echo those stimuli which Raphael received from the great masters who worked in Florence or whose paintings were visible there. The influence of Leonardo - whose fighting warriors from the Battle of Anghiari (1505) in the Palazzo della Signoria provided an extraordinary example of martial art (the painting deteriorated very rapidly because of shortcomings in Leonardo's experimental technique and so is no longer visible) - predominates in these works. But references to Flemish painting suggest the environment of Urbino, where Northern influences were still quite vivid.Raphael's imagination which is particularly developed in the details of the St Michael, is more balanced in the figure of the Archangel, the focus of the entire composition. This sense of balance and composure is developed further in the other two panels, where the landscape, still of Umbrian derivation, accentuates the serenity of the figures, notwithstanding the dramatic character of the subject. These small panels are indicative of a moment in which the painter gathers the stylistic fruits of what he has assimilated so far and, at the same time, poses pictorial problems which will be developed in the future

It was installed in the Church of St Wolfgang in Schneeberg, a prosperous silver-mining town in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) of southern Saxony in 1539, where it provided a suitable focal point for the liturgical rituals of local Lutherans for nearly hundred years. In 1633, at the height of the Thirty Years&#146; War, it was stolen by imperial troops. During its history, it was dismantled, later partly reinstalled in Baroque environment.

31964-061madon.jpg	The composition is a great plastic concentration, echoing Michelangelo's Tondo Doni.

His naked upper body leans forward and slightly to the left, a movement continued by his head, which bears the crown of thorns and is surrounded by a halo. The face of the Saviour, shown in profile, streams with blood and is partly cast in shadow by the heavy crown of thorns; the eyes and mouth are half-open. Christ wears a white cloth about his loins, and a red cloak slips from his shoulders. The angel to the left is clothed in a white cape held together by a brooch and supports Christ's bent right arm with his two hands, placed one on top of the other. To the right a second angel, mouth open, looks upwards in lamentation. The light, shining flesh tones of the Saviour are lent additional intensity by their contrast with the warm, yellowish-brown of the wall behind.

10826-stvaast4.jpg	The principal patron of Daret over a period of twenty years was the abbot of St Vaart, Jean de Clercq.Out of all of Daret's works that are recorded in Jean de Clercq's account books, only four panels have survived to the present day. They come from an Altarpiece of the Virgin (St Vaast Altarpiece) painted for the abbot between 1433 and 1435. Two of them, the Visitation and the Adoration of the Magi, are in the State Collections in Berlin; the third, the Nativity, is in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, and the fourth, the Presentation in the Temple, is in the Petit Palais museum, in Paris.One of these four panels, The Visitation is reminiscent in its composition of paintings by Rogier Van der Weyden on the same theme. But the three others are closer - strikingly close to the art of Robert Campin, especially the Nativity which should be compared with Campin's Nativity in Dijon. The two compositions are essentially analogous: the Virgin kneels before the Infant who is lying on the ground, while Joseph holds up a lighted candle. They also share the small group of angels and the scene of the two midwives taken from an apocryphal Gospel, which Daret treats as a separate episode. Daret is less inventive than Campin, and his ambition seems limited to creating a simple tranquil atmosphere. The clothes worn by the midwives are less exotic, and the angels are holding a single phylactery. Above all, Daret's Nativity has been substantially simplified: it has fewer characters, and materials and textures are rendered with less attention than in Campin's. One has only to look at the ageing skeleton of the stable to measure the distance that separates the two artists. Certain elements have also been modified, so that, for instance, the ass and the ox in Daret's picture face towards the scene of the Birth, rather than turning their backs on it.The other three panels show that Daret was a talented painter of the human figure and a sensitive landscape artist

02820-m_crozat.jpg	The remarkable portrait of Madame Crozat was shown at the Salon in 1741. In this portrait Aved conveys something of the sitter's character - including a lack of vanity - and her ordinary existence. With her tapestry work and a teapot handy in the background, she might stand as representative of the highest bourgeoisie: sensible, comfortable, industrious. It was thought worth commenting on in 1741 that another woman would have suppressed the fact of those spectacles which Madame Crozat has just taken off and still holds; Aved seizes on this very detail to give a sense of momentary pause in a pleasantly busy domestic life.In the nineteenth century the painting was supposed to be by Chardin.

21310-01jobwif.jpg	There was a change in La Tour's style from the morbidity and mystery of such pictures as the penitent Magdalen contemplating a skull and a monk watching over his dead or dying companion, to works of a much calmer and more distilled air. The transitional pictures, also datable to the 1630s, are Job Mocked by his Wife at ï¿½pinal and the so-called 'Woman with the Flea' at Nancy.The composition of the Job is immediately striking. There is the same flickering movement that is found in the Payment of Dues, even though there are only two figures. It is derived from Bellange's etching of The Annunciation. an unexpected source, especially when it is considered that The Annunciation by Caravaggio was already in the ducal collection at Nancy by 1616 (this much-damaged picture is now in the Musï¿½e des Beaux-Arts at Nancy where it is accepted by most authorities as authentic). No influence on La Tour is discernible in the Caravaggio, although it is virtually certain that he knew it.The subject is a rare one, and La Tour has introduced a special pathos into Job's sufferings.Although its composition is a complex amalgam of the Bellange Annunciation, the mood of the Job is entirely original. La Tour has concentrated on a dialogue between the unfortunate Job and his ill-tempered wife, and has allowed us a glimpse of a rarely painted subject, a husband tormented by his wife. Her cruel mockery of him comes over with great force as Job sits helplessly contemplating his sores (the potsherd he uses to scrape them is on the ground). The spectator is forced to realize that this painter's genius lies chiefly in his ability to observe the human condition; his skill in painting candlelight is only part of the brilliance. Such a depiction of the complex relationship between two people is rare indeed in French art of the period, and in his maturity La Tour was to develop the concept of dialogue between people to ever-increasing heights of subtlety

10101-30altar1.jpg	Lucas Cranach the Elder's Schneeberg Altarpiece is the first retable known to have been created for an evangelical church. It was installed in the Church of St Wolfgang in Schneeberg, a prosperous silver-mining town in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) of southern Saxony in 1539, where it provided a suitable focal point for the liturgical rituals of local Lutherans for nearly hundred years. In 1633, at the height of the Thirty Years&#146; War, it was stolen by imperial troops. During its history, it was dismantled, later partly reinstalled in Baroque environment. Now it is reconstructed in modern frame.The picture shows the altarpiece in the modern frame, first opening

18697-2triump.jpg	Girolamo Godi, organizer of a Vicenzan literary salon and friend of Pietro Bembo and Alvise Cornaro, engaged Gualtiero around 1550 to decorate the villa. In addition to the loggia, the decoration of four rooms in the right wing of the villa can be ascribed to Gualtiero: the Hall of the Gods or the Putto, the Hall of the Triumphs, the Hall of the Caesars, and the Hall of the Sacrifices. Gualtiero's sudden death in 1552 prevented him from completing the work which was taken over by Battista Zelotti and Battista del Moro, who created the frescoes in the other rooms.Along the vertical surfaces of the Hall of the Triumphs, Gualtiero distributed imposing Telamon figures, connected by faux festoons of greenery and fruit. The figures illusionistically support a monochrome frieze embellished with scenes of ancient triumphs.

15716-coronati.jpg	After a probable initiation at the workshop of Jacobello del Fiore, followed by a phase of admiration of Gentile da Fabriano, Michele Giambono soon passed to a sweetened form of Gothicism with somewhat affected colourings rather along the lines of Pisanello's work in the Palace of the Doges in Venice. The 'Coronation of the Virgin' which in fact has a clearly Gothic air about it, can probably be identified as the panel commissioned from Giambono in 1447 by Giovanni Dotto for the Church of S. Agnese. Attached to the order were the conditions that it should be delivered by the end of 1448 and that it should be similar to the one, painted not many years before by Antonio Vivarini and Giovanni d'Alemagna for the Venetian church of San Pantalon

11986-pansyrin.jpg	Pan in Greek mythology is the god of woods and fields, flocks and herds. In Renaissance allegory he personifies Lust; he charmed the nymphs with the music of his pipes. The story of Pan and Syrinx is described by Ovid (Metamorphoses 1:689-713). Pan was pursuing a nymph of Arcadia named Syrinx when they reached the River Ladon which blocked her escape. To avoid the god's clutches she prayed to be transformed, and Pan unexpectedly found himself holding an armful of tall reeds. The sound of the wind blowing through them so pleased him that he cut some and made a set of pipes which are named after the nymph

24895-stigmata.jpg	This is a portable Franciscan diptych which critics variously associated with the Luccan school of the Berlinghieri. In actual fact the work seems to characterize admirably a period of Florentine art represented by the master mosaicists of the cupola of the Baptistery and Coppo di Marcovaldo.Characteristic of this master, who may reasonably be considered pre-Giottesque, was a direct and vehement insistence on the significance of the scene. Note, for example, the naturalness of the surroundings, with the hill and the temple rising above and almost holding up the kneeling saint as if to emphasize his bodily weight. This concreteness, a quality at the heart of Florentine painting from these very early times, might explain why Vasari attributed the work to Cimabue.

10514-m_taper.jpg	"The picture's title Madonna della Candeletta (Madonna of the Taper) derives from the thin candle that burns at the lower left. I is signed in Latin on the plaque at the bottom: ""Karolus Crivellus Venetus/Eques Lavreatus Pinxit."" This central panel of a large altarpiece formerly in the cathedral of Camerino has been at the Brera since 1811. Other panels are in the Accademia, Venice; another, a Crucifixion, is in the Brera. Side pilasters with little figures of saints are in the museums in Lille, Denver, Florence, etc.The characteristics of Crivelli's mature style, to which this work belongs, are sumptuous drawing, highly refined rendering of different materials and a superfluity of decoration. They are rooted in Venetian art and have some of the pungency of the tradition stemming from Squarcione. The content of Crivelli's works, however, is still that of courtly life, even though it is detached from its social roots and is transposed to the court of heaven. The diluted cultural life of the Marches, where Crivelli worked, his detachment from major literary sources, and the local taste in forms (dominated by Camerino) led him to construct his images almost heraldically and to set them in a courtly fairyland.His workmanship has an amazing precision and was substantially aimed at popular taste, being unsophisticated except in the visual and tactile astonishments that it provides. His tireless devotion to the same formula cut Crivelli off from other experiences, and led to dryness and involution. This can be seen in the difference in quality between The Madonna of the Taper, in which feeling still dominates form, and his last painting, the Coronation (also in the Brera), where feeling has been lost in the vast embroidery of details. In his amazing draftsmanship, Crivelli is most closely comparable to Botticelli, who worked in Florence, an urban centre of cultural exchange at every level. Crivelli, on the other hand, always worked in the provinces and, despite a magisterial command of his medium, ended by reflecting the static atmosphere of provincialism"

09300-vanitas6.jpg	This is an early work by Collier, painted during a period when he produced some of his finest work. He produced vanitas still-lifes throughout his career. The present version includes a candlestick, musical instruments, Dutch books, a writing set, an astrological and a terrestrial globe and an hourglass, all on a draped table. The objects signify that wealth, knowledge and power are all earthly, temporary and ultimately meaningless. The burning candle, pocket watch and hourglass denote the passage of time and brevity of life; the violin with a broken string indicates the transient pleasure of music; the money bag denotes the worldly riches, the scholarly books and globes the vanity of learning, and the military flag the worldly power.

26110-31tlove.jpg	The left panel is in New york, the right in Rotterdam. Many commentators found it difficult to accept that these two panels were actually companion pieces until a plausible explanation for this double allegorical work was proposed. It was, however, evident that they belonged together in one way or another because of the matching dimensions and architectural settings.The vanishing point for the perspective construction of both paintings is located on the line separating them. That means, taking account of Memling's consistent logic in this respect, that they cannot have been intended as the wings of a triptych, but were conceived as continuous scenes, separated only by their frames. We can no longer determine whether the diptych was fixed or folding. The panels are very thin, which might indicate that they had a painted rear which was subsequently sawn off. The woman holds a carnation in her hand, which is a long-established symbol of marriage. The white horse, on which a grinning monkey sits, bends down to drink, while the brown horse turns its head towards the woman. The horse, which is often used in both art and literature as a symbol of love, appears here in a double role. The white one with the monkey - the symbol par excellence of sinfulness, lust and selfishness - is the bad lover who is concerned only with self-gratification (slaking its thirst), while the brown horse gazes faithfully and unselfishly at its mistress.The physiognomy of the woman correspond with Memling's anonymous female type, which is to be found in both saints and angels. This fact alone indicates the purely emblematic character of the representation. What is more, if this figure had had a male portrait as a companion piece it could not have appeared in a left wing. The young woman is dressed in the manner of the Burgundian Court in the 1470s with a high hennin or `steeple' headdress and long train, which might place the allegory even more clearly in the realm of chivalry and courtly love

03996-bello304.jpg	"When Bellotto arrived in Warsaw in 1766 on his way to Saint Petersburg, Stanislaus II August Poniatowski, the new King of Poland, offered him a position as painter at the Polish court. Bellotto accepted the offer and sent for his wife and children (who were still in Dresden) to join him in Warsaw, where he spent the last fourteen years of his life. His most important work from this period is a series of twenty-six views of Warsaw, intended for the entrance to the royal suite of the palace, which was called ""Canaletto Hall"", after the painters assumed name. The views show locations related to the life of Poniatowski or containing allusions to the King's illustrious predecessors. They were grouped around a painting by Bellotto that showed the election of Poniatowski as king of Poland. The large View of Warsaw from the Royal Palace, one of the most impressive works from Bellotto's later years, did not belong to this group. Probably it was intended for the King's private apartments.In the painting one looks toward the South, along the wall of the Royal Palace on the right. A monumental staircase gives access to the royal suite on the first floor. This staircase, designed in 1773, the year in which the painting was made, was never actually built. In front of the palace the terrace on the Vistula can be seen. Both on the staircase and the terrace the spectator's attention is attracted by numerous small figures. In the middle of the terrace there is a riding school, with a young man receiving a riding lesson, and on the right a sculptor's workshop is seen. The lighted Lubomirski Palace below the terrace on the left forms the transition to the middle distance.In the upper right of the scene, churches and palaces are shown rising along the street called the Krakowskie Przedmiescie, or the Cracow Suburb. These buildings had a special significance to the monarchy and the street itself linked the palaces outside the city, Wilanow and Ujazdow, to the palace in the city. Thus, the street had turned into a Warsaw Via Sacra or Rue Royale. From right to left we see, inter alia. Saint Anne's Church, directly behind the palace; the church of the Carmelites; the two towers of the church of the Holy Cross; the Radziwill Palace and the church of the Sisters of the Visitation. In the middle of the scene are the buildings on the slope leading down to the Vistula and below that on the far left the river itself, with the small wooden cottages in the hamlet of Powisle huddled on its bank. To the left of the centre background stands the white Kazimierzowski Palace, the main building of the military academy.This canvas is highly successful in its rendering of an attractive, sweeping panorama; the blue sky, the long shadows and the light from the west which casts an orange glow over the scene are suggestive of a warm spring or summer evening. The various elevations in the painting, which leap from front to back and rise gradually from left to right, contribute to the illusion of space. The buildings along Krakowskie Przedmiescie Street rendered in an interesting alterations of lighted and shaded elements, create a strong sense of depth. By means of perspective and light the artist has ensured that the spectator's eye finally is directed to the gleaming white building of the military academy in the distance.The View of Warsaw from the Royal Palaces the last large town view painted by Bellotto. By this point the staffage had developed into an element of no less importance than the architecture. The painting attests magnificently to the artistes capacities, and constitutes a brilliant culminating point in Bellotto's oeuvre. Moreover, it marks a final stage in the development of topographical painting"

26066-17rein4.jpg	The closed altarpiece represents St Wilgefortis or Uncumber (with crown, beard and cross) and St Mary of Egypt (naked with three loaves). They are shown in a late-Gothic portal arch, whose decoration is related to that in the Floreins triptych. St Wilgefortis was the daughter of the king of Portugal, who wished to remain a virgin and not to be married to a heathen prince. In response to her prayers, she was given a beard to put off her suitor, with the result that her father subsequently had her crucified. St Mary of Egypt was a reformed prostitute who spent the remainder of her life in the wilderness, with just three loaves to sustain her. The linkage of these two saints might rely on the contrast between their respective hagiographies. Both represent total dedication to Christ: one as a martyr, the other as a penitent. Like St Barbara, Wilgefortis was invoked against sudden death without benefit of the last sacraments. St Mary of Egypt was the patroness of the Filles-Dieu nuns at St Julian's Hospice

18814-triumph2.jpg	This ceiling fresco makes up a set with three other frescoes. They were originally in the Palazzo Barbarigo-Dabal&#224; at Angelo Raffaele. The four frescoes were covered with whitewash during the nineteenth century and only rediscovered by chance during some restoration works to the building in 1936. On that occasion they were detached and mounted on canvas and taken to the Ca' Rezzonico. Despite their precarious condition after such treatment, these works - the only frescoes by Guardi to have come down to us - still clearly show his Rococo decorative talent, made light and joyous by the use of soft, almost pastel colours, and by the characteristic 'open' forms of his pictorial style

37541-scene11.jpg	Scene 11 of the cycle on the life of St Benedict depicts as Benedict founds twelve monasteries and supervises their construction.Some scenes of the cycle depicts the range of tasks that had to be accomplished to maintain the monastery's self-sufficiency. Among these are the erection of churches and other buildings in accordance with the founder's precepts (e.g. Scenes 11, 32).The chief appeal of Sodoma's paintings is their realistic depiction of life in the monastery. The scene in which the monks are building a church (Scene 11) is a fine example. A mason perched on scaffolding supported by the capitals of a colonnade is nearly finished with the job of troweling plaster onto the brick vaulting. In the background another workman is whitewashing the new vaults with a brush attached to a long pole. A stonecutter kneels in the foreground as he puts the finishing touches on the base for the next column

37959-scholar.jpg	This interior depicts an elderly man at a desk surrounded by insignia of humanistic scholarship and applied science, including a globe, folios, an alembic, and a shawn. The scholar has paused in his writing to reflect and seems not to be aware that there are others in the room: next to him is a young boy with a wreath of ivy in his hair, holding out an hourglass with the sand run through, a symbol of transience. Behind the boy is a man in a coat and soft cap, who points toward the scene at the desk with his left hand. Death in the form of a skeleton appears in the doorway in the background on the right, accompanied by a weeping little boy carrying a urine specimen in a small basket. This is an allusion of urine as a diagnosis method, suggesting that the scholar is about to hold a medical consultation.This subject is unusually serious for Jan Steen.

(The citizens of Abdera were proverbially stupid.) His philosophic system was contrasted with that of the earlier Heraclitus of Ephesus, who was known as the 'Dark' or 'Obscure' and was reputed to be melancholic.

24175-apollo_d.jpg	The story is taken from the Metamorphoses of the Roman poet Ovid. After Apollo had offended Cupid in his capacity as an archer, the god of love shot two separate arrows out of spite. One of these struck Apollo himself, who became inflamed with love for Daphne, the daughter of the river god Peneus. With the other, with opposing effect, he hit Daphne, who as a result fled Apollo's advances. Maratti depicts the point at which Apollo almost catches up Daphne and she is rescued by changing into an olive tree. In the foreground lies Peneus, recognisable as river god by his crock of flowing water.Carlo Maratti, a native of the Marches and a pupil of Andrea Sacchi, was one of the leading painters of the Rome of his day. The prestigious commission for this painting came from Louis XIV of France. In it the king consciously followed the image of the Sun King by selecting a theme with the sun god Apollo in the main role. The moment in the story chosen here is very traditional and well-loved in the pictorial arts. A famous and virtuoso model is Bernini's group in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. Even so, Maratti's work was rejected by the French court when his work arrived in 1681. The Acadï¿½mie that the king had founded, with its ideals of unity of place, time and action, reproached Maratti for depicting the river god Apianus in the background, although Ovid mentions only later in the story that this god lamented Daphne's lot together with Peneus.In accordance with the art theory of the time, which encouraged rivalry between artists, many French artists attempted to improve Maratti's composition by observing the academic rules in their own works with the same theme. In this way Maratti's painting became not only one of the first, but, ironically enough, also one of the most influential manifestations of classicism at the French court. Maratti's figures also contain various borrowings from classical antiquity and Renaissance models. His Apollo follows the Apollo Belvedere in the Vatican. The nymph to Apianus' right strongly resembles a print by Marcantonio Raimondi based on Raphael. Later Ingres and Manet sought inspiration from similar sources for their Odalisque and Le Dï¿½jeuner sur l'herbe respectively.

39591-2pesaro.jpg	Titian was neither such a universal scholar as Leonardo, nor such an outstanding personality as Michelangelo, nor such a versatile and attractive man as Raphael. He was principally a painter, but a painter whose handling of paint equalled Michelangelo's mastery of draughtsmanship. This supreme skill enabled him to disregard all the time-honoured rules of composition, and to rely on colour to restore the unity which he apparently broke up.We need but look at Madonna with Saints and Members of the Pesaro Family which was begun only some fifteen years after Giovanni Bellini's Madonna with saints to realize the effect which his art must have had on contemporaries. It was almost unheard of to move the Holy Virgin out of the centre of the picture, and to place the two administering saints - St Francis, who is recognizable by the Stigmata (the wounds of the Cross), and St Peter, who has deposited the key (emblem of his dignity) on the steps of the Virgin's throne - not symmetrically on each side, as Giovanni Bellini had done, but as active participants of a scene.In this altar-painting, Titian had to revive the tradition of donors' portraits, but did it in an entirely novel way. The picture was intended as a token of thanksgiving for a victory over the Turks by the Venetian nobleman Jacopo Pesaro, and Titian portrayed him kneeling before the Virgin while an armoured standard-bearer drags a Turkish prisoner behind him. St Peter and the Virgin look down on him benignly while St Francis, on the other side, draws the attention of the Christ Child to the other members of the Pesaro family, who are kneeling in the corner of the picture. The whole scene seems to take place in an open courtyard, with two giant columns which rise into the clouds where two little angels are playfully engaged in raising the Cross.Titian's contemporaries may well have been amazed at the audacity with which he had dared to upset the old-established rules of composition. They must have expected, at first, to find such a picture lopsided and unbalanced. Actually it is the opposite. The unexpected composition only serves to make it gay and lively without upsetting the harmony of it all. The main reason is the way in which Titian contrived to let light, air and colours unify the scene. The idea of making a mere flag counterbalance the figure of the Holy Virgin would probably have shocked an earlier generation, but this flag, in its rich, warm colour, is such a stupendous piece of painting that the venture was a complete success.

38184-stillife.jpg	Juriaen Streeck was the closest follower of Willem Kalf.

10968-109david.jpg	After the successful St Roch, David chose a subject from ancient history. The story of Belisarius was that of a loyal and successful general in the service of the Byzantine emperor Justinian. He had won major victories against the Vandals, Goths and Bulgarians, but he then became implicated in political intrigues, was accused of treason and disgraced. He became an outcast and was even reduced to begging; one version of the story also said that his eyes were put out.The painting shows a scene - Belisarius is recognized by one of the soldiers who served under him just as he receives alms from a woman - which is David's own invention, not having occurred in any of the written sources. This painting was the first fully resolved example of the new heroic and austere style that is now known as Neoclassicism. it is a picture with a serious subject that is painted in a sober and rational style. Few characters, set as if on a stage, exchange meaningful and easily understood gestures. Belisarius is a painting about charity, sympathy, dutiful patriotism and the reversal of fortune. Announcing the old man desperate situation, and appealing to the spectator's charitable sensibilities, the Latin inscription 'Date Obulum Belisario' (Give an obulus - an ancient Greek silver coin - to Belisarius) is displayed on the marker stone in the bottom right-hand corner

24476-jerome.jpg	In 1478 Masaccio left Florence for Rome to work on the polyptych in Santa Maria Maggiore, interrupting the work on the Brancacci Chapel, but he only had time to begin the left hand side with the panel of St Jerome and St John the Baptist before he died aged only 27.Once again Masaccio and Masolino worked together, but this time Masolino had to finish the job alone. The polyptych is no longer in its original place. The panels making up the front side were separated from the back ones. Although in the 17th century the six major panels were still in Rome in Palazzo Farnese, in the 18th century they were dispersed. The other five panels - all Masolino's works - are in London, Naples and Philadelphia. This panel is the only certain record left to us of Masaccio's activities in Rome

42719-shipwrex.jpg	By the 1770s Vernet's reputation as a leading painter of landscapes and marines was firmly established throughout Europe. The Shipwreck is a highly characteristic work and moreover, the type of scene that had a special appeal for later eighteenth-century sensibilities, with its physical and emotional drama and the pathos of man's futile struggle against the overwhelming power of the elements. All Vernet's skills as a painter are displayed here, from the beautifully drawn and densely modeled figures in the foreground, to the vigorous impasto of the crashing waves, to the rapid, sketchy scumbling of the clouds

44757-apostle.jpg	Zurbarï¿½n's picture of St Andrew is in marked contrast to Ribera's dramatic representation of the crucifixion of the saint. There is the same close observation of detail, but Zurbarï¿½n's picture has the calm majesty seen in the work of El Greco. These various qualities Zurbarï¿½n blends into a unity with an individual touch of his own. Just as the figure in El Greco's picture is suffused with blue-green shades, so here the figure of the wise old man is suffused with warm greenish browns. St Andrew is seen leaning against two beams or branches which serve, in a quite uncontrived way, to identify the saint, being in the form of the cross of St Andrew, his attribute. It is obvious at a glance that this picture dates from Zurbarï¿½n's finest period: the lined face of the saint, the peasant hands roughened by hard work and the austere folds of the robes, together create an impression of the serenity and permanence so characteristic of Zurbarï¿½n's still-lifes as well as his large compositions.In all probability the painting once adorned an altar in the Carmelite church of St Adalbert of Seville, together with its companion piece, the painting of the Archangel Gabriel, which is now in the Montpellier Museum

Erasistratos, his father's personal physician, discovered the cause only when he felt his patient's heartbeat become violent and irregular on the queen's entering the room; Antiochos had fallen hopelessly in love with his young stepmother Stratonice.

21943-2ferroni.jpg	"This portrait has long been a subject of controversy over its attribution to Leonardo. (The attribution to Bernardino de'Conti or Boltraffio can also be found in the literature.) The refinement with which the woman is gently turning her head and in which the eyes pick up and continue this movement clearly show it to be a work by Leonardo. Coarse overpainting of the hair has had an adverse effect on the painting without, however, being able to conceal its high quality.It has not so far been possible to establish beyond doubt the identity of the person depicted. It is very probable that this enigmatic and highly intelligent young lady was also a noblewoman at the Milanese court. It is even possible that this is another portrait of Cecilia Gallerani seen in the Cracow painting.The title of the painting is due to an erroneous cataloguing in the French royal collection, when it was mistaken for a portrait of Belle Ferroniï¿½re, the mistress of King Franï¿½ois I. The misunderstanding was increased by the fact that the band on the forehead of the sitter was also named ""ferroniï¿½re"" in the 16th century"

39678-03mockin.jpg	In his last years Titian painted a series of paintings dedicated to the Passion of Christ. These include: Crowning with Thorns (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), Mocking of Christ (Art Museum, St. Louis), Ecce Homo (The Hermitage, St. Petersburg) and two versions of Christ Carrying the Cross (The Hermitage, St. Petersburg and Museo del Prado, Madrid).

00687-road_cal.jpg	The painting shows Christ on the road to Calvary bearing the cross on his back. Behind him, a figure who is probably Simon of Cyrene helps him to bear up the cross, while in front another figure pulls at a cord around his neck. Christ turns his head back towards his mother, the Virgin Mary, who helplessly holds out her arms towards her son. Behind her are the holy women, recognizable by their haloes.The composition adheres very closely to a painting of the same subject by Simone Martini (now in the Louvre), which was at that period considered the model for portrayals of this episode.Andrea di Bartolo remains faithful to the Trecento style of Sienese painting in the way he packs the figures closely together, and also in his gold background, architecture and landscape. Nonetheless, he manages to create a sense of spatial depth through the buildings and the landscape which opens out to the right. This depth is accentuated in the foreground by the placement of the legs of the figures on the realistically painted ground, which acts as a stage for the action

18214-0307grec.jpg	El Greco first painted the subject in Venice, some years earlier, in the small signed panel in Washington, and he was to take it up again, much later, in Spain, and adhere closely to his original design. As with the Christ Healing the Blind, inspiration for the composition as a whole is from Tintoretto. The main central group, however, is very close to a Michelangelo design, known in drawings, and also in Venusti's painting after Michelangelo's design (National Gallery, London). The figure of the woman walking with a child could be a reminiscence of a similar motif in Raphael's tapestry cartoon, the Distributing of Alms at the Golden Gate. The two men in conversation, who also appear in the middle distance of Christ healing the Blind, have become a grand subsidiary motif, and again hint at acquaintance with Raphael. The larger forms of the architecture also derive from Raphael and Rome, and are consonant with the grander conception of the one integrated action of the main group of figures.The four portraits at the bottom right represent, from left to right, Titian, Michelangelo, Giulio Clovio and possibly El Greco himself. The introduction of Titian and Michelangelo is clearly an acknowledgment of his debt to these two artists. To his friend, Giulio Clovio, he owed his introduction to the Farnese household. The young man looking out, pointing to himself, has similar features to the self-portrait in the Christ healing the Blind at Parma, but the long hair is strange. It has also been suggested that he could represent the young Raphael. The portraits of Titian and Michelangelo (died 1564) were taken from existing portraits, and that of Giulio Clovio follows closely El Greco's portrait of his friend in the Naples Museum, painted c. 1571. El Greco does continue to include portraits in his paintings of religious subjects, but here there is no proper connection with the subject matter

40222-virgin.jpg	This icon (an image created as a focal point of religious veneration in the Orthodox Eastern faith) represents the Virgin as 'The Madre della Consolazione' and St Francis of Assisi whose presence on what is ostensibly a Greek icon is unusual, in that he was a saint of the Latin church, not the Orthodox. It can be accounted for, however, by the fact that this icon was made on the island of Crete. For four centuries after 1204, when the Byzantine Empire fell to western attack, Crete was ruled by the Venetians. This fostered a mixture of iconographical motifs, both western and eastern. This icon has been attributed to the hand of Nikolaos Tsafouris (d. 1501), an artist who was active in Crete. He signed several icons, and his name appears in Venetian documents.In this period a distinctive school of Cretan icon painting had emerged, producing works of a hybrid character, in which Byzantine traditions were modified by Western influences brought to the island by Venetian prints and paintings. The young Domenikos Theotokopoulos (El Greco) got his training in the workshop of a local icon painter in Crete

18920-1sextus.jpg	In this painting Guï¿½rin gave a theatrical depiction of a tragical historical (although invented) subject. Sextus, returned from exile, is seated in a stoical pose beside the deathbed of his wife. His fixed gaze reflects his inner questioning of the meaning of life. The scene is of heathen times, but it makes concealed use of the old Christian iconography. The cruciform in which the grieving man and the dead woman are so strikingly composed underlays the painting with an additional metaphorical significance, and the position of the daughter, who is clinging to her father's knee in pain, recalls the old Mary Magdalen motif in Christian art

This historical scene shows us Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the victor at Cynoscephalae at a meeting with the Achaeans in Aigon in 192 BC, where he so convinced the Achaeans with his speech that they decided to consider the enemies of Rome as their own enemies as well and declare war against them.

23390-1thud.jpg	"On returning home from Vienna where he had studied, the young Kï¿½roly Lotz looked at the Hungarian landscape and people with a fresh eye. Indeed, his excellent observations were way ahead of his age. Although his paintings depicting the landscape of the Great Hungarian Plains during storm were still rooted in Romanticism, their emotional charge, variegated compositional methods and, most of all, their realistic colours justified Lotz's personal ambitions. ""Stud in a Thunderstorm"", painted in 1862, is an excellent example of these qualities. His depiction of the clouds whirling in the depth of the space, his felicitous rendering of the horses and his ability to capture the feeling and unique world of the people of the flatlands could not be matched by any of his contemporaries.Lotz was also a renowned fresco painter; he was the first demonstrate in this lesser known genre in Hungary how an architect and a painter could work together in order to achieve a homogeneous work of art"

09015-09rest.jpg	"The Flight into Egypt appears in the background to the left, framed by a group of trees. Claude was fond of this subject, yet he rarely approached it in such a discreet manner. The holy family, watched over by an angel, seem to be there almost by chance amid this classically inspired jewel-box of a landscape. The overall effect recalls a pastoral scene from Virgil, which brings us to the three figures in Antique attire in the foreground: a shepherd playing a pipe, a seated washerwoman, and to the right a woman collecting water from a spring.A herd of cattle and goats approaches them to quench their thirst in the river. Everything unites to convey a vision of a harmonious world with a lively river, the font of life, flowing through its heart. Although the work is lent precision by the detailing of the different species of tree, it is the light that consolidates the whole: the clarity of the breaking day unfolding from the left &#151; as always Claude has painted the early morning &#151; brings the forms out of the shade and submerges the distance in a milky haze.The painting is signed as ""Clavde ivef"" (ivef = invenit et fecit)"

Zeus was in love with Thetis, a sea nymph, but received a prophecy that Thetis's son would become greater than his father, just like Zeus had dethroned his father to lead the succeeding pantheon of gods. In order to avoid such an outcome Zeus arranged for her to marry a human, Peleus. Peleus was very much in favour of such an arrangement, however, Thetis refused him.Proteus, an early sea-god, advised Peleus to find the sea nymph when she was asleep and bind her tightly to keep her from changing forms to escape. He did so, but she managed to shift shapes, becoming flame, water, a raging lioness, and a serpent. Peleus held fast and eventually the nymph was subdued and  consented to marry him

Similar towers, usually attached to the remains of a fortified wall, occur in a number of paintings by Klaes Molenaer, but Van Vries himself often depicted tall, square towers, most of them attached to ruined castles or river forts.The Pigeon House shows a few peasants going about their daily business, such as the fisherman who works in his boat, and the old lady going down to the river to meet him. On the edge of the bank is an old pigeon house, a run-down and dilapidated building. The painting shows a small corner of village life, focusing in and concentrating on the landscape, and is contextualized by the human activity that takes place within it

09650-02barber.jpg	"The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the Salone in the Palazzo Barberini. It depicts the Triumph of Divina Providentia - Apotheosis of the House of Barberini and the Papacy of Urban VIII.In 1625 the Barberini family purchased the Palazzo Sforza and other properties in the area which was to be incorporated to the Barberini palace we see today in Rome. Upon the death of Carlo Maderno, the first architect of the project, Gian Lorenzo Bernini succeeded as chief architect in 1629. Bernini's is the conception of the high central ""salone', which extends through two stories of the palace. The salone culminates in the great vault on which Piero da Cortona frescoed his Divine Providence, a pictorial celebration of the spiritual and temporal glories of the Barberini. Cortona also had a hand in the building of the palace complex: the largest of his contributions was the design of the theater wing, demolished in 1926 with the opening of the modern Via Barberini"

04144-nieuwez.jpg	The first paintings of canals as independent subjects were made in Holland, after 1660, in the cities of Amsterdam and Haarlem, and Gerrit Berckheyde's painting is an impressive example of this development. Looking from the Weessluis towards the north, this view shows the Nieuwezijds, bordered by the Bloemmarkt on the left and the Pijpenmarkt on the right. Both quays are lined with trees; a rowboat is being unloaded and draught horses are dragging their load over the cobble-stones. The Town Hall towers above the row of houses.The clarity of Berckheyde's composition owes much to his deft use of chiaroscuro. The shaded faï¿½ades of the Pijpenmarkt form a dark screen behind which the Town Hall rises, bathed in light. The dark reflections of the houses in the canal suggest depth and extend the distance between the illuminated quays on the left and right. The shadow on the Town Hall's western side serves to increase its volume, while at the same time forming an obstacle between the most important illuminated areas, namely the Bloemmarkt and the southern flank of the Town Hall. The painting is a stunning demonstration of Berckhyde^s ability to elevate topography to a higher order, without compromising accuracy.The gigantic new Town Hall of Amsterdam roused the popular imagination to such an extent that it was soon dubbed 'the eighth wonder of the world'. Following the completion of the lantern in 1665, the market was flooded with paintings depicting the colossal building. There seems to have been no lack of demand for them; Amsterdam boasted a great many rich, potential buyers. One might even say that the construction of the new Town Hall stimulated the development of the painted cityscape as an independent genre.Berckheyde made a number of paintings of the Town Hall, including several from the Dam Square, as well as five variations showing it from the Nieuwezijds

40394-6hunt.jpg	A hunting scene is the subject of one of Paolo Uccello's last works: the so-called Nocturnal Hunt in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Probably originally painted as the decoration for a linen chest, the scene is called nocturnal because of the strange kind of moonlight that falls on the elegant little figures of the hunters scattered through the dark forest. Except for the complex perspective composition that broadens the horizon, one might take this for a late Gothic painting, for here too we find the same painstaking description of details, sophisticated forms and movements that we found in the earlier panels. The overall richness of the scene is further stressed by the bright and elegant colours, particularly the strong reds of the coats.

This fresco must also have been characterized by the same heightened realism visible in the other paintings in the church, and which we come across also in another work dating from this same period, the Crucifixion Andrea painted for the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli, today in Sant'Apollonia.The composition is basically identical to the first Crucifixion that Andrea had painted several years earlier for this same convent, but the later work lays greater stress on realistic details.

07844-04medita.jpg	"Carpaccio is best known for the extensive narrative cycles he painted for Venetian confraternities, but he also produced a number of individual religious works for private collectors that are distinguished for their haunting stillness and richly descriptive approach. One of the most beautiful of these paintings is this depiction of the Old Testament figure Job and of Saint Jerome as a hermit meditating on the body of the dead Christ. Inscribed in Hebrew on the marble block where Job sits are the words ""I know that my redeemer liveth."" Numerous details underscore the theme of death and resurrection: the bones next to Job, the crown of thorns propped up against Christ's broken throne, the small bird that flies upward from Christ to symbolize the Resurrection. Even the lavishly painted landscape carries the theme by appearing desolate on the left and lush and open on the right."

00573-021johnb.jpg	In 1442 Andrea went to Venice where he frescoed the ceiling of the chapel of St Tarasius in the church of San Zaccaria together with an artist known as Francesco da Faenza (probably Francesco Torelli). This is the painter's first signed and dated work, although earlier, presumably in 1440-41, he had already painted a Crucifixion with Saints for the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, today in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. Both this painting and the San Zaccaria frescoes depicting God the Father, Saints and Evangelists, show what a strong influence the work of Masaccio and Donatello had on the young Andrea. And in particular, Andrea's interest in Donatello's sculptural and linear dynamic power already evident in the Santa Maria degli Angeli Crucifixion, becomes much more obvious in the ceiling frescoes in San Zaccaria.

Sale, Amsterdam, 1772, no. 23 (the first certain allusion to this picture). Sale P. Lyonet, Amsterdam, 1 791 . Sale Amsterdam, 1793. Sale Herman ten Kate, Amsterdam, 1801, no. 118. Sale Lespinasse de Langeac, Paris, 1809. Sale Lapeyriï¿½re, Paris, 1825. Acquired by A. van der Hoop, Amsterdam, from J. Smith, London, 1839. Bequeathed with the collection van der Hoop to the city of Amsterdam in 1854. On loan to the Rijksmuseum since 1885.As in the Woman with a Pearl Necklace, a solitary figure of a woman is standing immersed in her thoughts, this time in the center of the composition. She reads a letter and seems completely absorbed by it.This painting stands out by the simplification of the composition, which does away with the previously mandatory leaden window to the left. Even the chairs and table surrounding the principal and single figure have lost in importance. Only the map on the wall breaks the uniformity. Vermeer's palette has become very delicate and sophisticated. Blue predominates by its widespread use in the woman's jacket.The foreground again gains in emphasis according to the precepts derived from the inverted telescope.Otherwise, the viewer is only confronted with the pure majesty of the main figure, set against the clear wall, whose luminosity is balanced by the brownish map. In its classical simplicity, grandeur, and almost abstract conception, this is one of Vermeer's masterpieces

Ligeti spent a great deal of time travelling; he painted landscapes of the Middle East and of Hungarian as well. There were also several realistic details in these pictures.In ""Mï¿½rtonhegyi Road"", painted in 1876, he depicted the suburbs of the capital exactly as they looked at the time.

26349-player.jpg	The cittern, the pear-shaped, plucked string instrument the young woman is tuning here, was common in the 17th century, only later losing its place to the guitar and the mandolin, to be forgotten today. In Renaissance and Baroque painting, the subject of music is often linked to erotic themes and it is in this sense that one reads the figure of the elegant young man with the wine glass who stands behind the young woman, gazing at her yearningly as she concentrates on her task. Sitting at her side is a dog, a symbol of fidelity. On the table with its cover of oriental carpet, and emphasised by the light, is a still-life-like arrangement of violin and drinking horn.

41315-02cruci.jpg	This painting, one of the oldest in the Uffizi, was for many years given a general attribution to the Italian school of the twelfth century. Later, a close study of the clear, bright colours used in the small stories revealed the influence of miniature painting and the Byzantine taste of the composition, although with personal touches in the amusing narration which in places verges on the grotesque. The work is seen as significant evidence of the early influence of Pisan-Oriental art in Florence.The painting follows the Western iconographic formula of Christus triumphans. In the scenes of the Passion the artist has emphasized the most essential and dramatic moment of the action which unfolds itself in a single rapid movement of an expressionistic and popular tone.

The surrounding space, on the other hand, retreats into the darkness of the background, becoming both setting and foil, and establishing a relationship of tension with the central motif.

19557-celebrat.jpg	In the second half of the 1640s not a single Dutch portraitist, including Van der Helst, tried to emulate Rembrandt's revolutionary achievement, the Night Watch. Their group portraits are all clearly and sharply delineated collective portraits giving each man his due. The interest of Dutch artists and their clients in detailed portrayals won the day. The inclination towards brighter colouring which became popular during the forties by the influence of Van Dyck's followers, came to the fore and found favour with the public.This group portrait shows the banquet held by the St George's Guard to celebrate the Peace of Mï¿½nster which put an end to the Eighty Years' War on the 18th of June, 1648. In this painting Van der Helst succeeded in portraying no fewer than 25 people grouped around a table. To the right we see the captain (holding a silver drinking-horn) and the lieutenant congratulating each other on the successful outcome.

But the most meaningful passages are found in the predella scenes: the vast space which opens out beneath the colonnades of the Annunciation; the highly animated Adoration of the Magi; and the free quality of the atmosphere in the Presentation in the Temple, which foreshadows the extraordinary spatial intuition of some of the artist's future Vatican compositions

19396-breakfas.jpg	The aesthetically conservative principle of tables arranged strictly parallel to the horizontal edges of the painting was followed by Nicolaes Gillis and Floris Claesz van Dijck. (Predecessors were probably family paintings such as Marten van Heemskerck's.) Their still-lifes are classified as 'ontbijtjes' (breakfast still-lifes). Onbijt(je) was a light meal which could be taken at any time of the day.All these artists show a table with a table runner and a carefully ironed, white damask tablecloth whose creases, regardless of the laws of perspective, run in parallel lines towards the back of the painting. A relatively high viewpoint was also chosen, apparently to afford a good overall survey of the objects, which are arranged side by side, or in a circle, hardly ever touching or overlapping. The precious drinking vessels and pieces of textile show very clearly that the arrangement is that of a privileged household.In the early 1630s Heda began to use the compositional structures developed by Nicolaes Gillis and Floris van Dijck. Unlike those artists, however, he placed the white tablecloth on the left or right-hand edge of the table, so that the middle of the table is not covered and is no longer symmetric. In subsequent 'banketjes' (banquet pieces), the tablecloth was pushed further and further aside - as early as 1638 in Heda's paintings - until it was actually crumpled. Whereas for quite some time food was shown as almost untouchable, precious and just for display, increasing traces of consumption are now visible. The objects were no longer merely intended to embody status-defining values, but became evidence of spontaneous acts which disrupted the festive structures of the framework

35266-3deposi.jpg	The painting was commissioned in 1527 by the Confraternity of Santa Croce, and was probably finished before 1 July 1528. Compared with the preceding Deposition in Volterra, to which the painting refers in the figure of the deposer on the left descending one of the three ladders resting against the cross, and in the curly-haired young St John, portrayed in the background burying his face in his hands, as in the Volterra altarpiece, the Deposition of Sansepolcro places a greater emphasis on the figure of Christ, who has been taken down from the cross and is now lying in the Virgin's lap in the foreground.A reference to the moulded characterization of Michelangelo's anatomies is visible in the bodies of Rosso's painting; observe, for example, the youth standing to the right of the Virgin bending slightly forward in the act of holding up Christ's back. The light which covers the foreground of the composition and contrasts with the dark background is brightest in the clothing of this figure, highlighting its refined golden-yellow floral motif, and produces the extraordinary changing colour effects of the dress of the bystander seated in the foreground to the left of Mary Magdalene.More than for the reelaboration of elements associated with the art of Dï¿½rer and the great masters of classicism, the Sansepolcro Deposition is distinguished by a number of iconographical peculiarities. The most striking is the complete nudity of the body of Jesus, a clear break with tradition, emphasis being given to the ample volume of its swollen rib-cage. Transferring to the Virgin, the iconography which from the 14th century in Italy was traditionally used to represent Mary Magdalene, Ross portrays the mother of Christ with her arms splayed and held up, as if she herself was reliving the moment of crucifixion; the expression of the crucified Jesus seems in fact to be impressed upon the face of Mary, who is now prostrate with grief. Behind her, the horrible animal-like figure directing his squint-eyed gaze away from the scene probably takes up the theme of the bodyguard, the symbol of the treachery and wickedness that determined the killing of Christ, and also present in the Volterra Deposition

06559-garden_e.jpg	Jan, the son of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, was in Rome between 1593 and 1594. He is chiefly famous for his extremely sumptuous floral compositions, for his Allegories of the Senses, the Elements, and the Seasons, and for his landscapes with windmills, woodland paths, forests, villages, and markets, depicted in meticulous detail, and marked by a finely balanced succession of planes of perspective that lead the eye from the verdant wings toward the hazy blues of the distant mountains.A very large number of his works are views of the Garden of Eden (around 106 versions are known). Outstanding among them, along with this painting, are the ones in Budapest, at Hampton Court, and in the Louvre. Several of the motifs, such as the white horse on the left, or the leopards on the right, are derived from the works of Peter Paul Rubens, with whom the artist sometimes collaborated. There are many creatures in the picture: wild beasts alongside domestic animals, exotic birds on the branches and water birds in the pool, overhung by a bough from which dangle not only monkeys but the tail of a peacock, while two goats try to reach the buds of the roses that wind around the trunk of a pear tree, with cats hidden amongst its foliage. They are all represented in pairs, in an apparent reference to their entry into the Ark, while the tiny figures of Adam and Eve, in the background on the left, evoke the moment of temptation

07806-12woman.jpg	Unlike Florence, very few female portraits from the late Quattrocento and the years about 1500 survive from Venice. The present painting belongs to a small group of female portraits attributed to Vittore Carpaccio. Shown in three-quarter view facing right, the woman wears her hair parted in the middle and gathered in the back, where it is held by a net studded with small white beads. She is dressed according to Venetian fashion well documented for the period around 1500. The woman's dress and hair style are close to those in Dï¿½rer's Portrait of a Venetian Woman in Berlin, or the Portrait of a Young Venetian Woman in Vienna.The sitter of the portrait is not identified. She could be a woman who has had a humanist education, or perhaps a pious lady holding a book of hours or a similar devotional book

35502-31mythol.jpg	Painted by Rubens when he was still young, the painting shows to the full the impetuosity of his talent. The whirlwind composition is typically Baroque, while the horse charging headlong into the fight was an image perfectly suited to this artist's passionate temperament.Rubens took the subject of The Battle of the Amazons from Classical Antiquity; it represents the battle between Theseus's Athenians and the women-warriors of Telestris. A battle of this kind is briefly mentioned by Herodotus (4.110). The surging movement throws the opposing forces together; men, women and horses charge into combat, and the result is like an explosion within the picture space. The Amazons are hurled from their horses down into the river at the base of the picture, while Theseus's horse rears up towards the upper frame, and the wounded go swirling into the background, drawn by the current of the River Thermodon. This is one of the most dazzling feats of Baroque painting.

35324-lion.jpg	Rousseau was a self-taught artist whose first exhibition was held in Paris in 1886, when he was 42. He began to paint imaginary scenes set in the jungle by 1891, the present painting showing a lion devouring a jaguar was probably exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in 1907. The artist's unique vision, his intuitive sense of design and colour, and his precise, profuse use of detail combine to render this mysterious, exotic world authentic. The vegetation is inspired by his visits to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, but he disregarded their actual sizes in inventing forests that dwarf the figures of natives and animals. His animals are based on photographs in a children's book owned by his daughter

17725-212goya.jpg	This was one of the sketches for a tapestry cartoon that was never executed, due to the death of Charles III, who had commissioned them. It was among the sketches sold to the Duke of Osuna in 1799. The scene represents the most popular festival in the Madrid calendar, which is still celebrated on 15 May, the feast day of the city's patron saint, Isidore the Labourer. In a letter to his friend Zapater in Saragossa, Goya wrote of the difficulties of such a subject especially as he had to finish this painting by the saint's day 'with all the bustle of the court'. It is in fact a rare example of a landscape by Goya, taken from the far side of the Manzanares River with the city's landmarks on the horizon, and in the foreground the crowds amusing themselves as at a fair, the pilgrims hard to distinguish among the animated crowds.Goya's viewpoint must have been the Hermitage of San Isidro, the goal of the pilgrimage. The building in Goya's painting (also designed as a sketch for a tapestry cartoon), is still preserved, marking the spot where the saint struck a well of water with healing powers. On a tiny scale, Goya has included the pilgrims lining up to enter the church, a picnic scene and a group at the miraculous well. Many years later Goya was to decorate the walls of his country house, the Quinta del Sordo, built not far from the Hermitage, with a nightmare vision of A Pilgrimage to San Isidro.

41434-01galati.jpg	The church of Santa Caterina in Galatina, whose nave has a self-contained fresco decor from the early fifteenth century (140 picture compartments altogether) received lavish gifts, beginning in 1385, from the count of Soleto, Raimondo del Balzo Orsini (c. 1350-1406). He was buried in Santa Caterina, and the painting of the church is related to his tomb, which originally stood in the choir.The paintings, which are fully uniform in style and technique, are now thought to have been produced by a workshop influenced by a southern Italian branch of the early fifteenth-century Umbrian school. The manner in which they were painted and certain of their compositional motifs are most closely paralleled in the work of Ottaviano Nelli of Gubbio.The nave paintings at Santa Caterina extend across four bays and follow a program that can be traced back to a text of St Bonaventura. The largest group of paintings is the one presenting the Apocalypse according to the revelation of St John. It extends across three walls in the first bay of the nave and includes some fifty separate scenes.The picture shows a view of the choir through the three-aisled nave and entry wall with scenes from the Apocalypse

05373-flower.jpg	One of the oldest types of still-life is the flower piece. It seems that flower painting was established as an independent category in the Netherlands during the third quarter of the sixteenth century, with the rise of a widespread interest in gardening and the cultivation of exotic flowers. The principal member of the group of flower painters during the first decades of the seventeenth century was Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder, the founder of a dynasty of flower and fruit painters.His prime work is the brilliantly coloured Bouquet in an Arched Window. Jacob de Gheyn II and Roelandt Savery painted similar multi-coloured bouquets in niches, but only Bosschaert showed flowers against an open vista. The painting's exquisite attention to detail recalls works by miniaturists. Of Baroque chiaroscuro there is not a trace. Each bloom in his typically axial symmetrical arrangement is given equal attention and is minutely analysed in an even light.Analysis of the flower pieces made by Bosschaert and other flower painters of his time reveals that their bouquets were seldom painted from life. They were assembled from a number of independent studies which serve as patterns. The pictures frequently show blossoms which bloom at different seasons of the year, and it is not unusual to find the same flower, shell, or insect in more than one picture. This manner of composing flower pieces was continued by later artists. Moreover, the huge bouquets are usually far too large for the roemers or vases that hold them. If set up in the studio they would surely topple over.

07785-01mirac.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Meziï¿½res, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them: we notice immediately the basic difference between the archaic choice of images, sometimes portrayed purely as a sort of inventory, offered by the older artists and the new, lively depictions of the city painted by Carpaccio.The subject of this 'telero' is the healing of a man possessed performed by Francesco Querini, the Patriarch of Grado, through the intercession of the relic of the Holy Cross in his palace at the Rialto. The actual miracle is relegated to a position in the upper left part of the picture and takes place in the wonderfully airy loggia of the palace. This allows attention to be centred on the view of Rialto Bridge and the banks on either side of the Grand Canal. The bridge depicted is the one built in 1458; at its sides can be seen the shops and in the centre the part which could be raised to allow the taller ships to pass. This construction, which was of wood, collapsed on 4th. August, 1524 and was replaced by the present stone bridge which was opened in 1592. On the left bank, amid the ancient structures can be seen the sign of the Storione Hotel, which stood in a side road, while in the background, behind the bridge, the 'loggia' of the Rialto can be made out, a much-used meeting-place for users of the market. On the right bank are visible the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, destroyed by fire in 1505, Ca' da Mosto with its open canal-side entrance which still exists, and the old campanile of the church of Santi Apostoli which was reconstructed in 1672.All the descriptive precision of the physical surroundings does not cause the work to degenerate into the merely documentary, but acts as a lively support to the scene. On the black waters of the Grand Canal and along its banks the intense daily life of the place runs its course while the noble-men and the very elegant 'compagni della Calza' cluster around below the loggia of the Palace of the Patriarch of Grado and the buildings with their round chimney-pots stand out against the pale blue and pink sky. Each manifestation of reality is caught in its truest aspect, its most accurate shade of colour, in this evocation of a relaxed and airy fifteenth century Venice, a representation which is a long way from the 'inventory' style adopted by the other contemporary 'ceremonial' painters

32429-1valle1.jpg	The picture shows the paintings in the choir of Sant'Andrea della Valle: Scenes from the Life of St Andrew by Domenichino in the apse calotte; Scenes from the Martyrdom of St Andrew by Mattia Preti on the choir walls.Sant'Andrea della Valle is the general seat for the religious order of the Theatines. Its construction started 1593 under the designs of Giacomo della Porta and Pier Paolo Olivieri, and under the patronage of Cardinal Gesualdo. With the prior patron's death, direction of the church passed to Cardinal Alessandro Peretti di Montalto, nephew of Sixtus V. By 1608, work restarted anew with a more grandiose plan, mainly by Carlo Maderno. The interior structure of the church was finally completed by 1666, with additional touches added by Francesco Grimaldi (1560-after 1626). The Baroque faï¿½ade was added between 1655 and 1663 by Carlo Rainaldi, at the expense of Cardinal Francesco Peretti di Montalto, nephew of Alessandro.One of the greatest challenges to confront Roman religious painting in the first half of the seventeenth century was the decoration of the Sant'Andrea della Valle. The structure of the church competed architecturally and in its urban setting with the two most important sixteenth-century Roman religious structures, namely Saint Peter's, with its similar tall drum cupola visible from afar, and Il Ges&#249;, which provided the pattern for its longitudinal structure flanked by chapels. With the painting of choir and the cupola of Sant'Andrea these prototypes were outdone, for at that time neither Saint Peter's nor Il Ges&#249; had any high-quality painted decoration. Accordingly, Sant'Andrea della Valle set a new standard, and introduced an epoch of Roman monumental painting that would culminate a half-century later in two simultaneous Jesuit commissions (in Sant'Ignazio di Loyola).Domenichino was commissioned in 1622 to paint the choir. Originally he was supposed to take over the entire painted decoration of the church, however, the commission for the cupola was given to Giovanni Lanfranco instead. This led to a breach between the two former workshop assistants of Annibale Carracci. Both Domenichino's pictures in the choir calotte and Lanfranco's cupola were completed in 1628.Mattia Preti was commissioned in 1650 to paint the nave of the church. The commission included four pictures in the nave vault and the compartments above the windows. Additional contracts in the same year obliged the painter the paint three scenes from the life of St Andrew on the wall of the choir, and pictures on the wall of the antechoir. The paintings on the nave vault were not realised.Preti transformed the apse into a monumental triptych. The centre of the composition, placed on the central axis of the church, shows the apostle stretched on the cross. This scene is flanked by The Erection of the Cross, and The Entombment. Originally Preti was also supposed to paint the smaller panels above the passages to the presbytery chapels. Because of a litigation, he never actually did so, and the two panels were ultimately executed by the Albani pupils Carlo Cignani and Emilio Taruffi. The scenes - St Andrew Condemned by Aegeus, and Arrival of the St Andrew Relic in Ancona - produced jointly by the two young Bolognese artists completed the cycle

38290-washingt.jpg	Gilbert Stuart was a leading painter of his period and earned his livelihood by painting portraits. He enjoyed his first success in London, where he had gone at the beginning of the Revolutionary War in search of sitters; he returned to America in 1793 and painted many prominent people, including the first five American presidents. Even after his exposure to British styles and techniques, he retained the straightforward realism of much of colonial portraiture. His work is characterized by skillful drawing, excellent composition, and a sensitive use of colour.He painted George Washington for the first time in 1795, and the work was greeted with such enthusiasm that at least 32 replicas were ordered, although only 18 are known to exist. The original painting was the basis for the one seen here, which is among the earliest and finest replicas. It has been suggested that the immediacy and vitality of the president's features indicate that it was painted, at least in part, from life. Stuart's work had a strong influence on many American portrait painters of the early 19th century

17965-05cintol.jpg	Benozzo painted one of his highest quality paintings for the high altar of the church of San Fortunato in Montefalco: the Madonna della Cintola, which is now in the Pinacoteca Vaticana. The town of Montefalco presented the painting to Pope Pius IX (1846-1878).Angels are surrounding Mary in a semi-circle and, as it were, form an aureole in which the arrangement of the angels' wings matches the points of a crown. The gold background, which in the Middle Ages was used to elevate the depicted scene and give it an unreal, supernatural element, had from the 15th century onwards been replaced by depictions of landscapes and architectural settings. By this time, the gold background was already much rarer in Italian painting and symbolizes the transcendental, divine space, increasing the distance between the saints and the secular world. The subject of Mary lowering her girdle is not mentioned in the Gospels, but in the New Testament Apocrypha, Thomas, one of the 12 apostles, doubted Mary's Assumption. The Virgin appeared to him and, as proof, gave the doubting apostle her girdle. The theme was particularly popular in Italian, and particularly Tuscan, art during the 15th century, for since 1365 the Madonna's girdle had been venerated as a relic in the cathedral of Prato. The lowering of the girdle was frequently depicted - another peculiarity of Italian art from the 15th century - in combination with the Assumption of the Virgin.The pillars at the side of the altar panel contain depictions of saints, Sts Francis, Fortunatus and Anthony of Padua being on the left, Sts Louis of Toulouse, Severus of Montefalco, whose remains are kept in San Fortunato, and Bernadine of Siena are standing on the right side.The predella contains six scenes relating episodes from the life of Mary. It begins on the left side with the Birth of Mary, continues with her Marriage, the Annunciation, the Birth of Christ and the Presentation in the Temple, and ends with the Death of Mary

26554-01_3ce1.jpg	"""Ham saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren who were without. An Shem and Japeth took a garment, and laid it out upon both their shoulders, and went backward, covered the nakedness of their father, and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.""Michelangelo evidently neglected the chronological sequence of the Noah series, for Noah's offering should have come directly after the Deluge. Instead, Noah asleep and mocked by his sons is the first fresco that meets the eye as one enters the Chapel through the east door. It occupies a small field between the four ignudi. But the sleeping Patriarch has surely been placed at the end of the first row of frescoes for some good reason. The degradation of the Patriarch, who resembles a Roman river god, and was yet chosen by God to outlive the Flood and ensure the survival and redemption of mankind, was due not to an overdose of wine but to human loss of spiritual memory; to the hypnotic sleep of man oblivious to his origin, enacted here by the father of the race. The sons who stripped and ridiculed him do not know what they are doing and understand neither themselves nor their fate. Noah's devotion and piety pacifies the Father and gives unto God what is God's. For his sake the Eternal has decided to redeem mankind. If the sons mock their father it is their own shame, not his; it is the fall and the inexorable karma of the race which men in their blindness neither see nor understand.With this biblical motive Michelangelo gives us a blinding insight into his lifelong grief over the human condition. To see in his work nothing but a preoccupation with problems of composition is surely petty and short-sighted. These are self evident and he solved them as best he could, but his main concern was with mankind and his own soul.The composition, top-heavy on the right, is not altogether a success. The unattractive way in which the face of the son on the extreme right is outlined is a relic of Quattrocento imprecision which the artist will soon discard. Too little emphasis is given to the motive of redemption symbolized by the Beloved of God digging his vineyard to the far left. The vat in the centre dominates the scene like a nightmare"

06512-08crippl.jpg	"Though small in scale, this work concisely expresses Bruegel's sarcastic, anguished, but ultimately sympathetic view of the human condition. It has been suggested both that he is depicting a simple scene of the departure of the lepers of Lazaretto for a carnival, and that the cripples have a political, sociological, or moral significance, but in either case the artist gives a powerful impression of the physical misery and the moral isolation of these outcasts.Bruegel depicts the cripples in isolation in this late picture. A woman is withdrawing, presumably having brought them food. The cripples appear excited; we cannot detect why. The different headwear could indicate the various social stations: mitre (clergy), fur hat (citizen), cap (peasant), helmet (soldier), crown (aristocrat). ""A lie goes like a cripple on crutches,"" says a Netherlands proverb. This would mean that all of society is hypocritical. It is not this allegory which is of interest to us today, however, but rather Bruegel's view of maimed people"

16804-1cavall.jpg	The Salone dei Cavalli (Room of the Horses) was one of the first rooms to be completed, in 1526. It was used for banquets or dances. Originally, the lower parts of the walls were decorated with worked leather hangings.

21314-05dream.jpg	La Tour's mature pictures form a close-knit group which must date from the years immediately before and after 1640. None of them is documented, although some of them are signed. The most typical and one of the best preserved of them is the so-called Dream of Joseph at Nantes, which in many respects forms a microcosm of La Tour's art and the problems which surround it, in terms of both history and the interpretation of the subject.As recently as 1913 it was attributed to Rembrandt, although the picture was clearly signed La Tour in the top right-hand corner. It is interesting that an illustrious name should have been sought for so magical a picture, and the subject, even now, is as elusive as was the former difficulty of attribution. A youth in biblical costume is making a beckoning or announcing gesture before an old man who has fallen asleep reading a book. The traditional interpretation is that it is a Dream of Joseph, even though Joseph is normally shown as a carpenter (as he is in La Tour's Louvre picture). The youth is hardly the angel Gabriel either, coming to warn Joseph to flee to Egypt in order to escape the impending massacre of all children in Bethlehem by Herod's soldiers.A possible explanation for this enigmatic picture is that it depicts the moment when the young Samuel, having been, he thinks, summoned by the elderly priest Eli, finds him asleep. This surprises Samuel, who at that instant realizes that it is God's voice calling him. If this interpretation of the subject is correct, La Tour has with characteristic subtlety and understatement shown the exact moment when the youth Samuel arrives before the sleeping old man, with a 'here I am' gesture. Samuel's pose is unforgettable. All attempts at the naturalism with which La Tour is so wrongly credited have been abandoned, leaving a Mannerist twisting of the fingers and the caprice of shielding most of the candle flame. Above all, there is an exquisite stillness, which pervades not only this picture but also the other all-too-few masterpieces from this period

13726-rosso.jpg	The Palazzo Brignole Sale (dubbed Palazzo Rosso because of the colour of its stucco exterior) was erected between 1671 and 1679 on the prestigious Strada Nuova (present-day Via Garibaldi) in Genoa. The decoration of the palazzo was accomplished in two phases. In 1687-89 the team of Domenico Piola and Gregorio de Ferrari - with the assistance of Niccol&#242; di Viviano Codazzi (1642-1693), Antonio Maria Haffner (1654-1732) and Sebastiano Monchi (c. 1630-1706) - painted the east wing, including the south loggia, then in 1691-92 the frescoes in the rooms of the west wing were executed by Giovanni Andrea Carlone with the assistance of Antonio Maria Haffner and Carlo Antonio Tavella (1668-1738). The quadratura painter Antonio Maria Haffner worked both for the Piola-Ferrari and Carlone teams.The works by Piola and Ferrari in the east wing, the four rooms on the third floor dedicated to the Four Seasons, are considered the highlights of the entire decoration. The ceiling paintings of the Seasons, striking in their vivid colours and their synthesis of influences from Correggio and Pietro da Cortona, are among the most successful achievements of Genoese painting from the High Baroque.The cycle of the seasons was a favoured subject in room decoration. The cycle illustrated in the Palazzo Rosso deviates from the traditional iconography, replacing the familiar pictorial motifs with deities and personifications. Spring is represented by Mars and Venus, presented as contrary forces suggestive of the months they dominate. The image and spirit of summer are embodied  by an extremely foreshortened Apollo-Helios, barely recognizable against the glowing sun, and a lion symbolizing summer's zenith. Autumn is personified by Bacchus with Ariadne and his train made up of satyrs, Maenads, and cupids. Personifications of the cold winds Eurus, Borea and Austro represent winter.The allegories for Autumn and Winter were executed by Domenico Piola.

The pastoral setting emphasizes the essential innocence and spontaneity of the participants, who are unafflicted by the stiffness imposed by the conventions of formal society. Eroticism is subtly rather than openly expressed. F&#234;te galantes continued to be depicted by Watteau's pupils Nicolas Lancret and Jean-Baptiste Pater.

19746-alley.jpg	Hobbema painted a narrow range of favourite subjects over and over again. In 1668 he became a wine gauger with the Amsterdam customs and excise, and thereafter seems to have painted only in his spare time. His new position, which he held until the end of his life, probably accounts for the slackening and a certain unevenness in his production during his late decades. A few works of this later period show his compositions broken up into too many detailed areas. The trees acquire an almost linear sharpness, and the pictorial effect hardens.Yet there are some notable exceptions, one of which almost seems a miracle, because in this work Hobbema not only revives his old grandeur, but surpasses himself as a composer and painter of the Dutch countryside. This is the rightly famous The Alley at Middelharnis. It does not take away from the glory of this picture that there are precedents in Dutch landscape painting that date back for the first decades of the century for the conception of a strongly foreshortened road lined with trees in a wide flat landscape.Hobbema altered earlier schemes by centralizing the whole composition, focusing interest on the middle and far distance as well as the immediate foreground with its uncultivated grove on one side and an orderly arrangement of saplings on the other, and by the unprecedented height of the lopped, thin trees which carry interest to the towering sky (regrettably, the sky was extensively damaged before the picture was acquired by the gallery in 1871; much of its paint surface is the work of modern restorers). The painting offers a topographically accurate view of the village of Middelharnis on the island of Over Flakee (Province of South Holland) in the mouth of the Maas; the view of the village from the Steene Weg (formerly Boomgaardweg) looks much the same today. This masterpiece is the swan song of Holland's great period of landscape painting which fully deserves its high reputation

03859-137alle2.jpg	The four panels with Allegories at the Accademia in Venice are often likened to the Sacred Allegory, but they belong instead to the artist's scanty secular production. They originally formed part of a small dressing-table with a mirror and a rack on which to hang objects, belonging to the painter Vincenzo Catena who, writing his will in 1530, left it to Antonio Marsili. The spread of this kind of furniture was so great that in 1489 the Venetian Senate prohibited its manufacture, limiting it to what was strictly necessary. Often, as in this instance, their decoration comprised symbolic representations of a moralistic character.An unusual theme for Bellini, the panels represent respectively: Lust tempting the virtuous man or Perseverance (Bacchus who from a chariot offers a plate of fruit to a warrior); fickle Fortune (the woman on an unstable boat holding a sphere); Prudence (the naked woman pointing at a mirror); Falsehood (the man emerging from the shell). There are diverging opinions about the interpretation of the last two representations, such that they have been seen as: the Woman as Vanitas (on the basis of similar representations by Jacopo de' Barbari and Baldung Grien), and the Man in the shell as an allegory of Virtus Sapientia, since the shell might have a positive connotation as a generative principle

08807-niagara.jpg	"Frederic Edwin Church was the most significant successor of Thomas Cole, founder of the Hudson River School. Church's landscapes represented unsullied nature as an embodiment of his faith in the God-given strength and mission of the New World, ""America's sacred destiny,"" as he put it. An example is Niagara Falls, an icon of American painting. The extremely wide format, the horseshoe shape of the falling masses of water, and the horizontal stretch of land in the background, visualizing the incredible extent of this natural wonder, lend the picture the monumentality of a gigantic panorama. The falls and the immense, untouched landscape become a natural symbol of the political energy of a people and nation devoted to making the world a better place to live in.

18288-1003grec.jpg	El Greco painted pairs of saints from the 1590s. This painting's subject is the reconciliation between the two apostles who had been in disagreement, a fact shown by the joining of the hands, that intertwine without touching.The intensive colours of the cloaks, whose energy underlines the Baroque contrasts of light and shade, did not prevent El Greco from creating a balanced composition. The delicate painting of the hands and portrait-like faces concentrate the attention on the humanity of Peter and Paul (the latter resembles El Greco), while the freely executed patches of clothing give a sense of the greatness of the apostles' ministry.

Two warriors were sent to bring him back. They discover him in Armida's enchanted garden and hold up to him a shield, as a mirror in which he recognizes that he has neglected his duties. He abandons the sorceress and returns to the battle. The scene is divided down the middle by a tree. Armida sits to its right and attempts to make Rinaldo stay.

24160-j_paris.jpg	This scene from Greek mythology is transported in a highly personal fashion to a German forest with contemporary figures. Paris appears as a Swiss country gentleman who has just presented Venus with the apple as her prize. Juno and Minerva have turned aside following their defeat.Juno corresponds with Paris in the colours of her clothes, while Minerva is similarly related to Venus. From a branch of the tree, blindfolded Cupid - a symbol of love, which blinds - shoots an arrow at Paris. The two coats of arms hanging from the boughs belong to the family of Benedicht Brunner, a councillor of Berne, who in all probability commissioned the painting.There is a strange discrepancy between the classical theme and the thoroughly anti-classical female ideal represented by the women, whose curved bellies can be traced back to Dï¿½rer. Manuel compensates for his difficulties with anatomy in the extreme delicacy with which he draws the faces.Employing the unusual technique of tempera on canvas, Manuel invokes a pastel-like palette of great charm. In details such as Venus' diaphanous dress he demonstrates the sophistication of his art. The composition, in which the figures are arranged as if in relief against the shadowy background of a wood, recalls Gobelin tapestries.

36356-pompei1.jpg	Sarri's series of Pompeii paintings, done between 1875 and 1887 are still the most sought after by collectors. They are intimate scenes of family life, located in the classical architecture of Roman or Pompeian patrician houses. They always depict a young devoted mother, showing love and attention to her small children. The composition is carefully studied.

18741-guard206.jpg	"The painting is the companion-piece of The Grand Canal, Looking toward the Rialto Bridge, also in the Brera.Formerly considered an imitator of Canaletto, Guardi is actually a romantic interpreter of Canaletto's ""scientific"" views. In his hands the crystalline geometry of buildings is dissolved in atmospheric colour. Guardi is a ""virtuoso,"" like those eighteenth-century musicians who went from execution to interpretation, to variation, to improvisation, and sometimes even to creative invention. His variations, with respect to Canaletto, concern not only the technique of painting, but also the perspective framework.The composition of this work is less rigidly constructed and less scientific, with a multiplicity of vanishing points that slow down and articulate the scene in more dramatic form.

24965-0view2.jpg	The citadel at Manta was erected in the 1300s at a strategic point in what was once the border region between the marquessate of Saluzzo and the duchy of Savoy. The house of del Vasto ruled here from 1091 to 1601. The paintings of the Great Hall (Sala Baronale) on the second floor were commissioned by Valerano Bastardo di Saluzzo (c. 1375-1443).The room contains two picture cycles, the Fountain of Youth and the Nine Heroes and Nine Heroines, one across from the other. The frieze-like sequence of scenes with the Fountain of Youth in the centre is on the long south wall. The second frieze fills the north wall, and like the other cycle, it overlaps the two end walls. Its  first and last pairs of figures appear on the west and east walls, respectively.Until the 1960s the frescoes were attributed to the Avignon painter Jacques Iverny. Then the attribution was changed to the Turin court painter Giacomo Jaquerio (c. 1380-1453). However, both attributions were questioned by later scholars and at present we can speak of the painter as simply the Master of the Castello della Manta

05207-1garden.jpg	This painting is one of the most enigmatic pictures ever made, it has captivated and puzzled audiences since its inception. It is a large triptych, yet it was never destined for a religious setting. It is a conversation piece that is it is a picture intended to be closely viewed and its meaning discussed among friends or visitors. It can  be read on many levels, from the literal to the allegorical.The closed position depicts the Earth on the third day of Creation. The muted grey-green of the exterior contrasts vividly with the vibrant colours of the three interior panels. Reading from left to right, the interior begins with paradise. As Christ prepares to wed Adam and Eve, he direct his glance and blessing to the viewer. Bosch's Garden of Eden is filled with real and fantastic creatures, verdant meadows, anthropomorphic rocks and bizarre hillocks, part pod and part crystal. Above Christ is a fountain of life.The landscape and perspective schemes of the left and central scenes are identical. The garden is filled with young men and women of many races. There are no children and no older adults. Adam and Eve's progeny frolic unselfconsciously. Some kiss or engage in more amorous activities, others converse or eat strawberries and various fruits. A cavalcade of male riders encircles a group of bathing women in the middle third of the picture. The lack of a clear focal point or linear narrative makes the central panel the hardest to understand.By contrast, the right wing is hell, and it finds its counterparts in other Bosch pictures. Divided into three tiers, hell includes a blasted landscape exploding in flames and smoke. A windmill is powered by sails of infernal light.. Great crowds march endlessly. In the middle, some figures skate on thin ice. A bizarre tree-man dominates. His shell-like torso forms a tavern, while couples, each comprised of one human and one demon, dance on his head to a bagpipe's melody. He looks furtively rather than directly at the viewer. The foreground is cluttered with punishments for the seven deadly sins. The prideful woman will spend eternity staring at her reflection mirrored in the backside of a devil, whose hand-like roots fondle her body. Gluttons are consumed, while a miser excretes gold coins into a cesspool. The hunters are now hunted, as indicated by the rabbit with his quarry, in this world upside down. An amorous sow, wearing the headdress of a Dominican nun, attempts to seduce the man at the lower right into signing the legal document

41380-07dipty2.jpg	Two panels, The Dead Christ and the Virgin (National Gallery, London) and Sts John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) originally formed a diptych which may have been commissioned by Queen Sancia of Naples (1286-1345), the wife of King Rene of Anjou, who was particularly devoted to Mary Magdalene and was the founder of Santa Chiara.The combination of the Man of Sorrows and the Virgin with John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene in a diptych is unique. It was usual from the thirteenth century onwards to represent the Man of Sorrows in one wing with the Virgin and Child in the other.Giotto was called to Naples by Robert of Anjou in 1328. He took with him a number of painters who had worked with him on the frescoes in the Lower Church of San Francesco, Assisi. The diptych was likely painted by a member of Giotto's workshop in Naples, who was active on the frescoes in the Church of Santa Chiara. Giotto's Neapolitan workshop may have continued to operate after he returned to Florence in 1333

25976-04passi1.jpg	The following scenes are depicted in the painting.1. Entry into Jerusalem (left side)Having taken leave of his mother (she stands on the far left with Mary Magdalene), Christ rides a donkey towards the gate of the city, followed on foot by the Apostles. The people cut off palm branches and take off their cloaks, which they spread out on the ground. A man, his knees half-bent, doffs his cap. This pose is a standard one for its time, and appears particularly frequently in Van der Goes.2. Christ Drives the Money-Lenders from the Temple (left side)3. Judas with the High Priests (left side)This scene takes place diagonally below the previous one in a chapel-like space lit by torches. Judas is seen amongst the Pharisees who have given him a purse of money in return for his betrayal of Christ.4. Last Supper (left side)The moment depicted is that where John, his head on his master's chest, asks the name of the traitor, to which Christ responds by placing a piece of bread in Judas' mouth, whereupon Judas leaves.5. Prayer in the Garden (left side)6. Arrest of Christ (left side)Judas kisses Christ to identify him to the soldiers and Peter cuts off Malchus' ear. The action takes place in the dark. The soldiers emerge with torches from an archway lower down. A peacock sits on the city wall. The symbolism of this bird probably does not relate to the scene to its left but to the overall iconography of the Redemption and Rebirth.7. Denial of Peter (left side)Peter can be made out in a small side building, together with a glimpse of Caiaphas' maid, who has recognised him. The cock is shown above between the statues of Adam and Eve, who function as symbols of human weakness.8. Christ before Pilate (middle)Pilate, seated on his throne and assisted by two high officials, interrogates Christ. The man on the left will accompany him to Golgotha. The figure on the right is the one who paid Judas in the earlier scene. Pilate's wife touches his shoulder and urges him to be cautious. A young servant holds the basin of water in which Pilate will later wash his hands. A sculpted portrayal of the Judgment of Solomon appears above as a contrast to the cowardly jjudgment of Pilate.9. Flagellation (middle)On either side of the arched opening stand white stone sculptures of bearded, naked men, one with a jawbone in his hand, the other with a bow and arrow. No satisfactory explanation has yet been offered for these figures. The arch itself is decorated with a vine motif between two snails.10. Second Interrogation by Pilate (right side)This scene takes place to the right of the Ecce Homo in a narrow little building set further back. It is clearly intended to depict Christ (with an aureole) appearing before Pilate. This is the episode in which Christ is brought before the Roman governor once again after his flagellation, when he confirms that he is the King of the Jews. It immediately precedes the Crowning with Thorns. In spatial terms, therefore, this secondary scene has been pulled out of sequence.11. Crowning with Thorns (middle)12. Ecce Homo (middle)Herod, with his wife behind him in the shadows, shows Christ to the people who, by their gestures, condemn him to crucifixion.13. Making of the Cross (middle)As Christ's torture proceeds, two joiners construct the Cross. Their tools comprise a long hatchet, a large and a small drill and a wooden hammer.14. Carrying of the Cross (right side)A long procession departs from the city gate. John, Mary and two Holy Women follow Christ, who falls to his knees and looks at the viewer. He is preceded by the two thieves. A dog sniffs around to the lower left.15. Nailing to the Cross (right side)Amongst those present we recognise Pilate and his acolyte. The compositional type of this scene is rather rare for the art of its period, but does feature frequently in prints. In both cases, Germany appears to have provided most examples.16. Crucifixion (middle)To the left of the Cross we see the blind Longinus, whose sight is restored, and to the right the converted centurion. At the bottom of the scene Herod and his companion ride back down the mountain. Below them and to the left we see a monkey, a symbol of the devil, which Memling used repeatedly.17. Deposition (right side)The type is clearly inspired by the large triptych by the Master of Flï¿½malle that was located in St James' Church in Bruges, a fragment of which survives in Frankfurt (St&#228;delsches Kunstinstitut).18. Entombment (right side)19. Christ in Limbo (right side)20. Resurrection (right side)21. Noli me tangere (right side)22. Men of Emmaus (right side)23. Christ Appearing by the Sea of Galilee (right side

21308-10penite.jpg	An artist of great brilliance and originality, Georges de La Tour was from the duchy of Lorraine in northeastern France. Early in his career he gained knowledge of contemporary Caravaggesque painting with its emphasis on realism and dramatic effects of light and dark. This picture shows Mary Magdalen in a dark room at the dramatic moment of her conversion, her features lit by a candle flame that imparts a hauntingly spiritual quality to the work. The elaborate silver mirror, the pearls on the table, and the jewels on the floor symbolize luxury, which she has cast aside. In their place she clasps a skull, a common symbol of mortality

32984-06stuffe.jpg	"In 1516 Raphael and his followers were commissioned to decorate the bathroom of the Cardinal Bibbiena's Vatican apartments, the so-called Stufetta. The ornamental motives employed in the Stufetta paintings derive from those of the Domus Aurea, the villa of the Emperor Nero situated between the Palatine and the Velian hills. The Domus Aurea had recently been rediscovered. By 1516 it had become an object of great enthusiasm for contemporary artists. The names of Giovanni da Udine, Domenichino and other lesser known painters are still visible, scratched in the walls of the monument.Raphael painted the Story of Venus on the walls of the Stufetta, perhaps at the suggestion of the Cardinal. He represented the episodes of the story in the same techniques used in the Domus Aurea: stucco and fresco. The decoration of the borders started a new ornamental style, called ""grottesque"", which derives from the decoration of the ""grotto"" of Nero's villa. The new style was widely used throughout the Cinquecento and after It replaced the ""candelabro"" motif of the Quattrocento, generally made up of plants, animals and stylised putti growing out of a vase or amphora. Raphael thus left his mark in the field of decorative tastes as well as in that of pictorial style"

In 1635, four painters made a series of pastoral paintings for the Stadhouder's court, chronicling the popular story of Amarillis and Mirtillo, based on the  pastoral play Il Pastor Fido (The Faithful Shepherd) by the Italian poet Giovan Battista Guarini (1538-1612).

17744-312goya.jpg	"Goya had a close and lasting friendship with the Duchess, who was the last of an old noble line, and famous for her beauty, wit, and intelligence. When Goya was stricken with the mysterious illness that paralyzed him for a time, she arranged devotedly for his care. The full figure portrait can be interpreted as fervent thanks for her friendship. The painter has put his affection into the picture in a dedication written in the sand, to which the Duchess pointing: ""A la Duquesa de Alba. Fr. de Goya 1795."" The band of friendship on her wrist also bears his initials. Goya wanted to show her to posterity with a mild but watchful gaze. Her candid expression is emphasized by the raised brows and the framing curly hair. The palette is reduced to a few colours, the landscape is bare and the simplicity of the handling may stand for the sincerity of their friendship.

02739-adoratio.jpg	A painter and sculptor educated in the school of Costa and Francia, Aspertini was attracted by fanciful, bizarre forms, elements certainly drawn from North European engravings which were widespread at the time.In this Adoration of the Shepherds the fantastic construction concealing an apse enriched with various elaborate decorations, the figures twisting and darting vivaciously in the most unusual directions, and the tiny, unreal landscape, are enough to convince us that Aspertini was an extremely unusual artist with a decidedly individual and inimitable style

31186-91annun1.jpg	The subject of this painting has nothing to do with the Golden Legend, this is an addition by Piero, who introduced this scene at the bidding of his patrons. The Annunciation is to the left in the lower register on the altar wall. It serves to remind us in a general way of the incarnation of Christ and his sacrifice on the cross.The classical architecture is present once again with the elegant column in the centre. The symmetry of proportions is broken by vanishing point, placed not in the centre but to the right, behind the Virgin. There is great attention to even the smallest detail, brought out by the reflections of the light. From the transparent veil that covers Mary's head, to the pearls that decorate her dress, from the wood intarsia on the door, to the shadows that are projected on the white marble surfaces, there are many new elements that will be further developed in Piero's later works

Her headdress is elaborately decorated with geometric pattern, her jewelry is as extravagant as her dress. The identity of the woman in not known, her elaborate and costly attire indicate that she belongs to the elite echelons of society. In fact, the portrait stands as an important document of German high fashion and taste in the first part of the sixteenth century.Although portraits of women facing left are often matched by ones of a male sitter - a betrothed or a husband - facing right, no pair has surfaced for this portrait which is probably an independent painting

11465-selfport.jpg	Desportes was the son of a peasant and was born in Champagne. At the age of twelve he was sent by his father to Paris and entered the studio of Nicasius Bernaerts (1620&#151;78), a Fleming and a pupil of Synders who enjoyed considerable success as a painter of animals. After the death of his master Desportes studied at the Academy and for a time seemed to be settling down to a career as a portrait painter, in which capacity he spent the years 1695&#151;96 at the Court of Poland. On his return to Paris he began to devote his attention to the painting of animals, in the form either of hunting-scenes or of still-life compositions with dead game. It was for these works that he was celebrated in his own day, and they were bought by all the most important patrons of the day, headed by Louis XIV, who commissioned hunting-scenes, portraits of his favourite dogs, and pictures of rare animals for Marly and the Mï¿½nagerie at Versailles

36998-rainbow.jpg	Even in its later period, Flemish landscape painting retains the main distinguishing characteristics that emerged as early&#183; as the 16th century in the works of such atrists as Pieter Brueghel and Momper.This painting shows a sweeping view from a slightly elevated position, sloping down over the cattle pastures in the foreground towards a river plied by a cargo boat on the left and with a village on its banks to the right. Towards the background, the terrain slopes upwards again, with fields under changing sunlight and clouds, and a double rainbow in the sky. On the left, the view broadens out into the background towards the hills on the horizon.A Dutch landscape painting, for example by Ruisdael, could hardly be described in this manner. Unlike Flemish landscape paintings. their Dutch counterparts rarely include so many different and contrasting elements. Here, we have proximity and distance, hill and plain, animals, people, boats and houses. While Flemish landscapes frequently have a universal theme, Dutch landscapes tend to concentrate on a single aspect. This painting is typical of the later work of Sibcrechts, who emigrated to England in1672. Whereas his Flemish landscapes generally portray a small detail, his later work is topographically more precise; on the right we can recognize the village of Henley-on-Thames

16150-chris15.jpg	This dramatic scene takes place at night. Torches shine out among the sticks and halberds against the blue of the sky. The throngs of people crowd into the centre, towards Christ, who is betrayed by Judas' kiss. Every movement, even that of Peter as he cuts off the ear of an attacker, and every gaze heightens the tension of the central confrontation.With the force of his body Judas presses against Christ, who appears to disappear beneath the traitor's cloak. This expresses the inevitable outcome of this overwhelming confrontation. Surrounded and hemmed in by numerous faces, the profiles of Christ and Judas almost collide. The two look at one another &#151; the one with dignity and seriousness, the other full of malice. The whole drama of the event is captured in this infinitely long exchange of glances

18897-semirami.jpg	The story of Semiramis is recounted by the Roman historian and moralist Valerius Maximus in his De Factis Dictisque Memorabilibus Libri (vol. IX, p.3, ext.4), a collection of short stories illustrating examples of good and bad conduct from the lives of important figures. Semiramis, a woman of unrivalled beauty, was the daughter of the fish-goddess Derceto, and became one of the founders of the Assyrian empire of Nineveh. Interrupted at her toilette by news of a revolt, Semiramis, the legendary queen of Assyria, demonstrated her determination as a ruler by refusing to finish combing her hair until she had led her army to crush the rebels. This depiction of the story is made lively and dramatic by the emphatic gestures and by such bold compositional devices as the off-center placement of Semiramis and the radically cropped figure of her maid at right. The subject clearly appealed to Guercino, for he painted no fewer than three treatments of the theme, all of half-length format. The first is a this painting in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which he executed in 1624 for Daniele Ricci. In around 1627-28 he returned to the subject, with a painting formerly in the Staatliche Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Dresden, destroyed in 1945. The third and final treatment was commissioned in 1645 by Cardinal Cornaro, and is now in a private collection
