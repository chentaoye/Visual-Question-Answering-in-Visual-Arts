18020-30old1.jpg	The oldest king is closest to the Christ Child on the altarpiece and is followed by the largest procession of pilgrims. His vanguard is made to appear visually longer due to the about-turn that the procession makes. He is wisely and calmly gazing towards the young king on the opposite wall. His long gray full beard shows him to be from the Middle East, for the Florentines of the 15th century, where a smoothly shaved face was the predominant fashion, considered this to be the decisive characteristic of the Orient.The figure of the old king has been considered to be a portrait of the patriarch of Constantinople. The identification is based on the context in which the paintings were produced: the Council of Ferrara-Florence in 1439. The council, which had at first met in Ferrara, was moved to Florence as Ferrara was not able to provide further financial support or security. It was possible to move the council due to financing provided by the Medicis, in particular Cosimo. Since 1438 he had been the 'Gonfaloniere della Giustizia' (Standard-bearer of Justice), the head of the eight priors who together formed the constitutional body. Because of this position, Cosimo was able to prepare for the council and the reception of the dignitaries. One of the results was a decisive financial success, a year of high profits for the Medici bank. In this context, therefore, painting the chapel was also meant to serve as a reminder of the brilliant part Cosimo had played in the affair. The council had not successfully carried out its aims, in the long term the council was to be unsuccessful, however, this had not yet been evident during the 1440s and 1450s. At that time the discussion was continued in Rome and not until 1484, more than 50 years after the frescoes were completed, did the Greek Orthodox Church finally reject the agreement reached in Florence

39680-05philip.jpg	The painting is an 'Allegory of the Battle of Lepanto'. On 7 October 1571 the combined allied fleets of Spain, the papacy and Venice, under the supreme command of Don John of Austria, met and defeated the Ottoman fleet in Greek waters at Lepanto (now Nafpaktos) in the Corinthian Gulf. It was an extraordinary triumph for Christian arms with an enormous psychological impact bringing relief to Christendom which had long felt beleaguered by Islam. As the news spread across Europe, in Toledo a Te Deum was celebrated in the great cathedral, Philip II endowed an annual procession to commemorate the victory in perpetuity

33360-apointer.jpg	The picture represents 'Pero son of Pluto' - a pointer, the property of Colonel Thornton, on the point over a Snipe, a Mallard drake taking off beyond. Thomas Thornton (1757-1823), self-styled Prince of Chambord and Marquess de Pont, is famous for being one of the most dedicated and flamboyant sportsmen of the 18th and 19th centuries, dividing his time between hunting, racing, shooting, angling and hawking.The present painting dates from the last years of the 18th century, when Reinagle was engaged in painting a series of canine portraits for various patrons (including the Thorold and Thornton families), before embarking in about 1802 in the large series of the various breeds of dogs of the British Isles which he painted as models for the engravings of the same in the Sportsman's Cabinet, a periodical which for a time was a great rival to the ubiquitous Sporting Magazine. The picture exhibits the free brushwork and broad treatment allied with vibrant colour which is the hallmark of the artist in his prime

38100-stilglas.jpg	Stosskopf, who was born in Alsace and learned to paint from the Antwerp-born still life artist Daniel Soreau in the Flemish painters' colony at Hanau, specialized above all in glass still-lifes with delicate light effects. Joachim von Sandrart was to point out in 1675 that Stosskopf had painted 'many beautiful and outstanding works of still objects, such as tables and silver crockery'. This painting shows a large number of thin, Venetian-style glasses in a wicker basket. Surrounded by other glass, clay and china vessels the basket, which is parallel to the edge of the painting, has been placed on a brilliantly white tablecloth that hangs down over the edge and forms a sharp contrast to the dark background. Stosskopf may well have depicted the costly drinking vessels of an aristocratic patron

26709-lu07hez.jpg	"""Ahaz begat Hezekiah. Hezekiah begat Manasseh. Manasseh begat Amon."" (Matthew 1:9-10)The two main figures, seated and seen in profile, have their backs to each other. The solitary man seated on the right, slumped forward with his face in the shadow - apparently sleeping, but, in reality, probably immersed in anguished meditation - is usually considered to be Manasseh, filled with terrible remorse for having favoured idolatrous cults and persecuted the faithful followers of Yahweh. The young woman on the left is thought to be Meshullemeth, the mother of Amon: her lips half closed, an expression of infinite tenderness on her face, she is totally absorbed in the baby she is holding in her arms, while her feet rock the wooden and wickerwork cradle where another child sleeps. Hezekiah as a child is believed to be depicted in the spandrel above, together with his mother and his father, Ahaz.Although the two figures appear to be remote from each other, there is a complementary relationship due to the emotional contrast. Thus, the attitude of desolate self abandon of Manasseh is countered by the grace, vitality, and tenderness of the woman.The delicate range of colours in the clothes of the two figures tone with different scales, but there are precise links: the reddish-rose mantle that envelops the woman below her shoulders, modeled with very light brushstrokes in the parts in the light, is matched, with a slightly paler tonality, by the man's tunic, which is open at the sides.There is, moreover, greater contrast in the pattern of light and shade in the yellow of the skirt covering the woman's legs and the green of her shirt compared to the colours - which are, however, deeper - of the man's clothes and stockings. On the other hand, the penitential violet-gray cloth that covers the bowed head of Manasseh, falling over the curve of his back, appears to be more delicate in tone than the blue-gray ribbon that is intertwined with a white one in Meshullemeth's elaborate hairstyle"

18207-0212grec.jpg	Possibly the sequel to the Christ driving the Traders from the Temple (Matthew, XXI, 14: 'And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them'). Both subjects were treated by El Greco more than once in Italy. This is the smallest known painting on canvas by El Greco. The painting has been cut and the group on the right is incomplete. No large-scale works are known from his Italian period, and most are quite small. He does not appear to have received any important commissions before he moved to Spain.Three versions of this subject are known, all basically the same in composition, but differing in treatment. The earliest, an unsigned panel in Dresden, is looser in composition, smaller in conception, and introduces genre motifs of a dog, sack and pitcher in the foreground, eliminated in subsequent versions. The present painting, probably also painted in Venice, is more easily composed. The third and largest painting, now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York (possibly identical with the one in a Madrid collection at the time of Cossio's pioneer work on El Greco), with its comparative largeness of conception, belongs to his Roman period, after 1570. El Greco did not again take up the subject in Spain.The inspiration is from Venice. The dramatic use of recession behind the figures in the foreground is Tintoretto's invention. El Greco is still borrowing certain motifs, but the composition would seem to be original. The painting was among the Farnese possessions in the seventeenth century, and was probably brought to Rome by the artist, unless it was painted soon after his arrival in 1570. The figure on the extreme left, looking out towards the spectator, is certainly the young El Greco. He appears, however, nearer twenty than thirty years old

19250-stillif9.jpg	This painting represents a chocolate service with a wooden box of packed chocolate, two lacquered gourd drinking bowls, a wooden milk whisk, napkins, a spoon and pastries on a pewter plate. The round, wooden box at right is tilted at an angle to display the packed chocolate within, the black decorated vessels are drinking cups, and the wooden instrument resting above the pastries is a whisk for blending the melted chocolate with milk. Following the Spanish colonization of Mexico, regular trade by the 17th century meant chocolate swiftly became a popular commodity.Formerly the painting was attributed to Francisco Barrera, and later to Antonio Ponce, an assistant in van der Hamen's workshop

15923-tempes.jpg	"It was already in 1530 described simply as ""the little landscape on canvas with a tempest, a gypsy woman and a soldier..."" This painting, the meaning of which has been greatly debated, marks a moment of capital importance in the renovation of the Venetian style painting, and perhaps is the most representative of the very few genuine surviving works of Giorgione.The vigour of cultural life at the beginning of the sixteenth century provided exactly the right fertile ground for the personality of Giorgione. With Giovanni Bellini and Vittore Carpaccio as examples in his early training and with his attentive interest in Northern European painting of Belgium he soon decided to attempt a naturalistic language. Colour attains to new all-important powers of expression of the poetic equivalence of man and nature in a single, fearful apprehension of the cosmos. The finest of all expressions of this new vision of the world is the 'Tempest', commissioned from the artist by Gabriele Vendramin, one of the leading lights in intellectual circles in the Venice of the day, in whose house the picture was recorded as having been hung by Marcantonio Michiel in 1530.Though many interpretations of the subject of this small painting have been suggested, none of them is totally convincing. Thus the mystery remains of what exactly the significance is of the fascinating landscape caught at this particular atmospheric moment, the breaking of a storm. Anxious waiting seems to characterize the mood of both the human figures, absorbed in private reveries, and every other detail, from the little town half-hidden behind the luxuriant vegetation and the lazy, tortuous course of the stream to the ancient ruins, the houses, the towers and the buildings in the distance which pale against the blue of the sky. The fascination of the painting arises from the pictorial realization of the illustrative elements. In the vibrant brightness which immediately precedes the breaking of the storm the chromatic values follow one another in fluid gradations achieved by the modulation of the tones in the fused dialectic of light and shadow in an airy perspective of atmospheric value within a definite space. Completely liberated from any subjection to drawing or perspective, colour is the dominant value in a new spacial-atmospheric synthesis which is fundamental to the art of painting in its modern sense"

18095-5martyrd.jpg	Gozzoli painted in San Gimignano another fresco of St Sebastian on the inner entrance wall of the collegiate church of Santa Maria Assunta. The work as commissioned by the city government in February 1465, six months after the plague epidemic.On this occasion the saint is depicted in accordance with the iconographical tradition of Italian art during the 15th century. The saint provided artist with an opportunity to depict a nude, which is why the theme was particularly popular from the Renaissance onwards. The arrows which his tormentors are pointing at him symbolize a sudden illness. The similarity of a body transfixed with arrows and that of a plague victim makes the choice of Sebastian as a plague saint appear plausible.Much of the painting was executed by assistants

17253-auvers13.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 754, JH 2014.In Auvers, during the last months of his life, van Gogh's suppleness of line reached heights of lyrical effusion. This treatment of form went hand in hand with an increasingly imaginative use of colour, which was a resource that van Gogh used quite ascetically. In many paintings, as in the Portrait of Doctor Gachet for example, where the flat area of red offsets nuances ranging from blue to purplish.Dr. Gachet was an ardent republican and socialist, and devoted to his artist friends, whose scorned and derided works he collected diligently. Soon he was inspired to paint too, and, using the pseudonym van Ryssel, he made something of a name for himself, mainly as a graphic artist.As a token of friendship, van Gogh painted two portraits of the doctor. He also did an etching; Gachet himself was a specialist in the technique and encouraged van Gogh to try his hand, though it remained van Gogh's only venture in this direction. The three versions show Gachet in the pose van Gogh considered typical of the man, in a contemplative and slightly melancholy mood. (Gachet had written a doctoral thesis on melancholy.

40063-4late2.jpg	Shortly before his death Lautrec painted his friend Joyant at a duck shoot, standing on his yacht in yellow oilskins and souwester, his gun at the ready. The background is only suggested, in some places the wood that Lautrec used as ground shows through - a technique that he developed to perfection. The figure of Joyant, by contrast, is painted with expressive brush strokes, entirely in yellows and russets. The painting was preceded by a number of sketches, and Joyant had to model for his friend no less than 65 times in all.Maurice Joyant (1864-1930), writer and art dealer, was one of Lautrec's most intimate friends, whom he had known since their schooldays together. It was Joyant who organised Lautrec's first exhibition, and he endeavoured to gain recognition for him all his life. After Lautrec's death, the painter's father appointed Joyant as executor. He catalogued all of Lautrec's work and, in 1926-27, wrote the first monograph about him. With Lautrec's cousin, Gabriel Tapi� de C�leyran, he built up the Mus�e Toulouse-Lautrec in Albi, which opened in 1922

42245-0313vela.jpg	In 1630 the count-duke of Olivares decided to initiate a lavish program of artistic display by the construction of a new pleasure palace on the eastern border of Madrid which came to be known as the Buen Retiro. Here theatrical plays and spectacles would be staged, tournaments and jousts would be organized, and painting, sculpture, and tapestry would be displayed. Beginning in 1630 with a modest renovation of the royal apartment in San Jer�nimo, the project was expanded in 1632 and again in 1633, culminating in a sizable complex of buildings surrounded by enormous gardens adorned by fountains, alleys and hermitage chapels. Once the structure was finished, Olivares faced with the mammoth problem of decorating the new palace, a problem that was solved by hundreds of pictures from Italy and Flanders and by commissioning as many works from local artists as they could paint. As for the works by royal artists and their disciples, the decoration of the Retiro was the major event of the 1630s and thus is a microcosm of court painting during the decade.The earliest of Vel�zquez's contributions to the decoration of the Retiro is  the luminous St Anthony Abbot and St Paul the Hermit, his first picture with an extensive landscape background. It was probably commissioned for the Hermitage. This picture shows several scenes from the legend of these saints simultaneously. In the background, St Anthony is asking a centaur the way to the hermit Paul. As he goes on he meets a homed monster with goat's feet, and on the right he is knocking on the door to the cave. The main scene shows the raven bringing the two saints a loaf of bread from heaven. To the left, we see the closing sequence: two lions are digging a grave for St Paul while St Anthony prays beside his corpse.Various models have been suggested for this composition, including a woodcut by Albrecht D�rer for the group of figures. The woodcut also shows the raven flying down to bring the hermits a loaf of bread, in the same attitude as in Vel�zquez's painting. A model for the landscape, of which we have an aerial view, has been traced in the so-called world landscapes of the Flemish artist Joachim Patenier, and the sketch-like dynamics of the brushwork and transparency of the colouring are reminiscent of similar pictures by Rubens

06848-bubbles.jpg	Van den Burch painting is heavily dependent on that of other Delft artists, especially Pieter de Hooch's.

This debt is obvious in this picture showing a sunny garden with fenced-in flower beds in the back of a private house. The garden is enclosed by a high wall, which runs parallel to the picture plane.

39358-22adora.jpg	The Adoration of the Shepherds is the first canvas on the outside wall of the Sala Superiore (Upper Hall). In an open scenic illusionism, the shepherds below present their gifts with impassioned and joyous gestures. They are counterpointed by the light and shadow created by the brightness from outside; above, main and secondary figures taking part in the divine event take on attitudes of conscious, almost solemn participation and are dazzled by the light which streams through the cracks between the wooden beams of the humble barn. The two different spiritual moments are underlined also by the different colour quality: without breaking the continuity the lower part is continually struck by reverberations and reflections and at the same time carefully and realistically evokes the animals in the stall, the brightly coloured peacock, the humble tools; the upper part is calmer and more relaxed although the wide chromatic background painting is strengthened by sudden, flashing rays of light.As so often in the works of Tintoretto, it is difficult to decide whether the horizontal seam on the gigantic canvas inspired him to create this unusual composition on two levels, or whether, conversely, he aimed to conceal the seam with the aid of the composition. Despite their poor surroundings, the Holy Family are remote from earthly regions. The model for Tintoretto's Adoration of the Shepherds may have been D�rer's woodcut from the series of Life of the Virgin or rather an outstanding engraving by Marcantonio Raimondi, made after D�rer's woodcut.As in D�rer's composition, the rafters anticipate the Cross of Christ. Deliberately, and with admonitory intent, Tintoretto contrasts the dilapidated roof above the Holy Family with the magnificent carved and gilded ceiling beneath which the full membership of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco used to assemble

19832-01amerba.jpg	"Bonifacius Amerbach (1495-1562) studied both law and classical antiquity in Basel and then Freiburg. In 1520 he went to Avignon to continue his studies under the writer, lawyer, and music theoretician Andreas Alciatus (1492-1550), known as Alciat. In 1525, Amerbach finally gained a chair in Roman law at the important university of Basel. His distinctive position as a scholar is revealed by his friendship with Erasmus, who named him as his sole heir. Like Bonifacius Amerbach, his son Basilius also became a passionate collector of Holbein's works, collecting them in the ""Amerbach Cabinet,"" which later formed the core of Basel's art museum.The year 1519 was marked by civic success for Holbein; he was made a Master in the painters' guild `zum Himmel', took up Basel citizenship and married. Until this date much of his daily work had been for the decorative arts, particularly glass-painting and book-illustration, but a new emphasis on portraiture, fomented by the success of the Meyer commission, first emerges with this piece.Holbein was lucky to have Amerbach as a friend and patron; the dogged and determined gaze of the withal kindly scholar, eventually Professor of Law at the university, was to be borne out in his assiduous collecting of Holbein's Basel oeuvre.The work is more painterly than the Meyer double-portrait and uses classical references with more confidence, as is appropriate in a portrayal of Amerbach in academic black. The panel bears Amerbach's own words of praise for the artist's truthfulness to nature and it also serves, pictorially, to emphasize the depth of illusory picture-space. As a result sitter and background are well-integrated, and real poetic feeling is glimpsed in the distant snow-covered mountains and chill blue sky"

The two paintings, both grand in scale and composition, make a perfect pendant pair; they were originally on shaped canvases for placement within a boiserie surrounding.

17774-503goya.jpg	This portrait was painted between July and October 1801 to commemorate the victory in Portugal, the War of the Oranges, so-called because Godoy, Chief Minister, is said to have sent a gift of oranges to the Queen in celebration. The Portuguese banners prominent in the foreground were awarded to Godoy in July and in October he was made Generalissimo of land and sea, which entitled him to wear a blue sash in place of the red sash of Captain General, which he wears here.Goya has portrayed Godoy in an elaborate and unusual composition, in a reclining posture reminiscent of some of his paintings of women on couches, seemingly inappropriate for the hero of a military victory. Goya's portrait hints at disrespect for the pomposity of his sitter, though Godoy was an important patron, a collector on a grand scale, for whom Goya painted many works including the famous portrait of his wife, the Countess of Chinchon. Godoy was also owner of the two Majas and may even have commissioned them.Goya's friendship with liberal ministers, such as Jovellanos and Saavedra, did not affect the relationship between the First Court Painter and the Chief Minister, whose rapid rise to power, attributed to his liaison with the Queen, made him notorious. Godoy must have been aware of the fact that he had been and still was the target of Goya's satirical wit in several plates of Los Caprichos, the ass looking up his genealogy in a book illustrated with row after row of asses, for instance, and in the etching entitled Birds of a Feather (Tal para qual). According to contemporary commentaries this is a reference to Godoy and Queen Mar�a Luisa, in particular to an occasion when she was mocked by a group of washerwomen for her unseemly behaviour. Yet despite all this, Godoy in his Memoirs written years later in France referred to Goya's Caprichos with pride as if he had been responsible for their publication

39661-09entomb.jpg	In the Entombment, the broader and more open brushwork that Titian was now developing serves to trap the light and add a torrid and glittering intensity to the colours. The dead weight of Christ's body is accentuated by collapsing the rhythm of the figures towards the left, resisted only by the bearded figure of Nicodemus. The latter has Titian's features, as if the artist wanted to allocate to himself a responsible role in the burial process, just as Michelangelo had portrayed himself as Nicodemus in his unfinished Piet&#224; of c. 1550 in Florence Cathedral. The Gospels describe Christ's tomb as being excavated out of rock, but in Titian's interpretation it takes the form of a classical sarcophagus decorated with the Christian themes of Cain and Abel and the Sacrifice of Isaac - Old Testament events considered to prefigure the Crucifixion and Resurrection. The corner of the sarcophagus projects into the very front of the picture plane in a cutting analogy of the disciples' grief.The motif of the Virgin holding the limp arm of Christ is inspired by Raphael's Entombment in the Villa Borghese and perhaps also by Aretino's Humanity of Christ

35387-20religi.jpg	This picture was commissioned for the high altar of the Capuchin Church in Cologne. The high format of the painting makes it likely to have been one panel of a fixed retable - originally an Italian feature adopted for altars north of the Alps particularly during the Baroque period. The style of the altarpiece, with its emphatic single figure, was developed further by Rubens shortly afterwards  in his designs for the altarpieces of St Ignatius and St Francis Xavier for the Jesuit church in Antwerp, and was highly influential.

35744-windmill.jpg	A Dutch landscape consists essentially of sky dominating low-lying land, where water (whether it be the sea or some canal) frequently reflects the clouds. In the work of Ruisdael the feeling of infinity, in which man seems lost, attains a Pascalian gravity.In this painting the sky responds in its cloud formations to the mighty wings of the windmill. As in Rembrandt's mature phase, which is approximately contemporaneous, this landscape shows classical elements which strengthen the compositional power. Horizontals and verticals are coordinated with the Baroque diagonals, which are still alive and help to create a mighty spaciousness. The atmospheric quality is as important as ever in uniting the whole impression. Light breaks now with greater intensity through the clouds and the clouds themselves gain in substance and volume. The sky forms a gigantic vault above the earth, and it is admirable how almost every point on the ground and on the water can be related to a corresponding point in the sky

39724-4dian_c.jpg	In his later career Titian, like Veronese, developed a greater seriousness and expressive intensity, not only in his religious works, but also in his pagan mythologies. The paintings Diana and Actaeon, and Diana and Callisto were painted as part of a series of six large mythological canvases {or poesie as Titian called them) for the principal patron of his final years, King Philip II of Spain. A very general theme underlying the series is that of the loves of the Olympian gods, and of the usually tragic circumstances for any mortals who become involved with them. The principal literary source for the paintings is Ovid's Metamorphoses, the most popular work of classical literature in the Italian Renaissance.Diana's nymphs were expected to be as chaste as the goddess herself. One of them, Callisto, was seduced by Jupiter who first disguised himself as Diana in order to gain the nymphs presence. In Diana and Callisto, the unfortunate Callisto is shown being stripped by her companions at the command of the chaste goddess Diana to reveal her pregnancy. Banished for her shameful state, Callisto was transformed into a bear by Jupiter's jealous wife Juno, but was later immortalised by him as the constellation of the Great Bear.In Titian's painting, Diana in her grotto confronts Callisto, her robes drawn aside to reveal an unmistakable pregnancy.The pendants Diana and Acteon and Diana and Callisto (both on loan to the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh) were formerly in the collection of Philippe Egalit�, Duc d'Orleans. After the French Revolution they were purchased by the immensely wealthy Duke of Bridgewater and still belong to his descendants

29279-211muril.jpg	The theme of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception was of unsurpassed importance to the faithful of Seville in the seventeenth century. The dispute over the immaculacy of the Virgin Mary was one of the most divisive in the history of the Renaissance church. There were two parties to the debate: the immaculist, lead by the Franciscan order, who believed that the Virgin had been miraculously conceived without original sin, and the sanctification party, lead by the Dominicans, who held that Mary had been conceived in sin and subsequently sanctified, or purified, in the womb of her mother. From the late Middle Ages the church of Castile had been an ardent proponent of the immaculist doctrine and repeatedly attempted to persuade the popes to elevate it to the status of a dogma. Finally in 1661 Pope Alexander VII issued a constitution declaring the immunity of Mary from original sin and forbidding further discussions of the issue.News of the papal ruling intensified in Seville the demand for images of the Virgin Immaculate. Murillo's rendition, executed for the Escorial, is faithful to the spirit of the times: the youthful Mary is a lovely creation, her physical beauty a sufficient expression of her purity; only a few putti are needed as supporting players. Murillo's appealing vision of the Immaculate Conception became canonical

06035-garden.jpg	In 1887 a small group of North American artists &#151; John Leslie Breck, William Blair Bruce, Willard Metcalf, Louis Ritter, Theodore Robinson, Henry Fitch Taylor, and Theodore Wendel &#151; settled in Giverny for the summer season. Some appear to have been previously unaware of Monet's presence in the village, but at least two of them, Robinson and Metcalf, had visited during earlier summers. They set up their easels along the streams or on the hillside and became acquainted with their newly adopted village from a distance. At first they avoided depicting the village itself, preferring more familiar landscape motifs. Gradually, artists in Giverny began to experiment with Impressionism, inspired by Monet and also by the region's dramatic light. Within a few years, many began to employ the more luminous, high-keyed palette and looser brushwork characteristic of impressionism

The adjoining three rooms of the summer suite were painted at the same time. The first two of them, the Udienza Pubblica and Udienza Privata, served as reception rooms, while the third and largest, which is directly accessible from the garden, was apparently used as an antechamber for visitors awaiting private audiences. These rooms were painted by Angelo Michele Colonna with the assistance of Agostino Mitelli with whom Colonna had established a highly efficient working relationship beginning in 1632.The pictorial program of the Udienza Privata, in the Ionic order, is devoted to Alexander the Great. Six scenes from his life appear in the form of simulated reliefs with applied gold on the columns intertwined with oak leaves, and the ceiling painting presents the Macedonian hero's apotheosis with furious pathos

27143-ploos1.jpg	In the middle of the eighteenth century numerous native portraitists - in addition to a few foreigners - were active in Holland. They could be relied upon for truthful portrayals and good conversation pieces. The high level they could attain is seen in van der Mijn's small pendants of the wealthy timber merchant, great collector, and amateur artist Cornelis Ploos van Amstel and his wife Elisabeth Troost. His collection included more than 7000 drawings and about 100 paintings. In addition he owned prints, sculpture, scientific instruments, and a good library.Single portraits, apparently too sensitive in their social significance, in the eighteenth century retain, by and large, their formal nature. Yet it was a formalism of a different kind a more informal formalism, one is tempted to say. In van der Mijn's portrait, the man takes on a pose of confidence which in its structure is rather conventional.  But there the resemblance to the conventions of portraiture ends. For this man is sitting down. That, precisely is an informality which is very unlike the seventeenth century. Confident men in seventeenth century portraiture, were most often standing; this was a sign of activity. But then, the man in this portrait is not concerned with giving an impression of activity. He is - this too is a new type of informality - at leisure.Van der Mijn portrayed the encyclopedic collector in his role as an artist; paintings depicting eighteenth-century collectors in their homes surrounded by their treasures on their walls were done in Holland, but not frequently. In van der Mijn's three-quarter-length, Ploss is seen with his chalk holder in one hand and a sketch in the other, seated informally

04824-virginchi.jpg	This painting is called the Madonna of the Orchestra. Ideas that are at once similar to yet different from the Madonna del Pergolato emerge in this smaller altarpiece, which was painted in Perugia about a decade later. The expressive di sotto in s&#249; perspective lends a sort of monumentality to the blond, music-making angels playing a variety of instruments - including a lute, tambourine, cymbals, rebec, reed pipe and harp - as they stand on a high, semicircular podium around the Virgin's throne; together with two additional angels in the foreground playing a portable organ and a zither, they give the painting its traditional name: the Madonna of the Orchestra. What is striking here with respect to the Pergolato Altarpiece is the new, systematic insistence on a marble revetment, although the effect is tempered by the meadow in the foreground emphasized by the two little angels who kneel to pick flowers.

21919-2annunc.jpg	The archangel Gabriel is kneeling as a dignified profile figure and raising his right hand in greeting to Mary, indicating her divine pregnancy. The Virgin has stopped reading and reacts to the Annunciation with an expression of deep respect and by gesturing with her left hand. There is a conspicuous perspectival mistake: her right arm had to be painted too long proportionally, so that, despite her seated position, it would still be able to depict the impressive position other hand over the prie-dieu. Leonardo depicted Mary in a three-quarter profile in front of the corner of a room. All three spatial coordinates - height, width and depth - converge on this point, thus creating a sense of depth in the picture as well as enhancing the importance of Mary. Her head clearly contrasts with the dark wall and her body is emphatically framed by the cornerstones whose parallel lines are converging on her.The work came to the Uffizi in 1867 from the monastery of San Bartolomeo of Monteoliveto, near Florence. It was ascribed to Domenico Ghirlandaio until 1869, when some critics recognised it as a youthful work by Leonardo, executed around 1472-1475, when he was still an apprentice in the workshop of his master, Andrea del Verrocchio. The sacred scene is set in the garden of a Florentine palace, with a landscape on the background which is already peculiarly Leonardesque, for the magic and unreal atmosphere created by mountains, water and sky. Leonardo's personality is pointed out also in the beautiful drapery of the Virgin and the Angel, while the marble table in front of her probably quotes the tomb of Piero and Giovanni dei Medici in the church of San Lorenzo sculpted by Verrocchio in this period

20782-lazarus.jpg	The huge Raising of Lazarus, one of four vast canvases painted by Jouvenet early in the eighteenth century for the church of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in Paris, is a tour-de-force of hes realistic vein combined with the elevated and idealized. Here the figure of Christ is somewhat over-bland and insufficiently assertive amid the agitated crowd gathered around the looming rocks of the tomb, but Mary, the sister of Lazarus, takes on the role of heroine, distressed yet decorous, and very consciously posed, in garments of gleaming white, gold, and green, to hold the centre of the stage. She is the embodiment of French academic classicism and could serve in comparable guise in many other pictures of the period. What she gestures towards, however, is dramatic in a different idiom: the stark moment of Lazarus's return from the dead, with him awakening in the deep cavernous gloom of his burial-chamber, lit only by a single torch, and experiencing hardly less violent and painful astonishment than do the figures gaping around him

05837-3empero.jpg	The picture shows the left wing of the diptych The Justice of Emperor III.The Emperor had married the daughter of the King of Aragon. His wife subsequently fell in love with a count of the imperial court. When the latter refused to respond to her advances, she publicly accused him of having made an attempt upon her honour. The Emperor, in a fit of anger, had the count beheaded on the spot. The count's wife asked to prove the truth of her husband's innocence by the ordeal of fire. She won her case, surviving the test unharmed. The Empress was found guilty of false accusation, and condemned to be burned alive.Each panel of the diptych represents two successive scenes taking place in two adjoining spaces. In the first, we see the Emperor, with his crown and sceptre, and his deceitful wife, standing beside the gate of a fortified town. They are watching as the count, dressed in white, barefoot and his hands bound, is led out to his execution. Several figures, including a Franciscan monk, accompany the condemned man, who is giving his last instructions to his wife as he walks. In the foreground, we rejoin the story after the execution. The count has been decapitated, and his mutilated body lies slumped on the ground. The executioner hands the count's head to his kneeling widow, who wraps it in a white cloth.The two panels are quite different from one another, both in atmosphere and composition. In the first panel, while the victim's face is distorted with pain, those who are there to witness his death betray no sign of emotion. In the second panel, however, both the courtiers in their expensive fur-trimmed clothes and the other important personages in their robes and red bonnets, are far from impassive. On the contrary, they are openly astonished at the miracle that has taken place before their eyes.

They painted on the ceiling the glorification of Felsina (Bologna's name in antiquity). Depictions of a personification of Felsina were popular subjects for the decoration of Bolognese senatorial palaces in this period. The club carried by one of Felsina's companions here alludes to Hercules and his Pepoli namesake. Additional references to him are the female personifications of virtues (Felicit&#224; Pubblica, Justitia, Prudentia, Liberalit&#224;) in the centre of the sides of the ceiling.

39096-080rina.jpg	Gerusalemme Liberata (Jerusalem Liberated), the great heroic epos by Torquato Tasso (1544-1595), published in 1581, not only inspired Tiepolo to create his series of paintings in the Tasso Hall of the Villa Valmerana near Vicenza, but also to create individual portrayals such as this one. The episode involving Armida and the hero Rinaldo is set in the days of the crusades.The enchantress Armida, resting after the rigours of battle, recognizes him as an enemy and is about to slay him. But at that moment, her hate turns to love and she bears him away to an enchanted island far from war, where Rinaldo is caught in the spell of her love. Two warriors sent to look for him make him aware of his error by holding up a shield as a mirror, reminding him of the battle, and take him back with them.Tiepolo's Armida is a magnificent Venus figure carrying a mirror as the instrument of her magical powers and accompanied by Amor as the bringer of love. The young hero rests devoted at her breast, wearing a garland of flowers as the sign of his entanglement

42629-29geogr0.jpg	Signature: Signed twice: on the cupboard; and signed and dated 1669 top right. All these inscriptions are dubious.Provenance: This painting and the Astronomer (Louvre, Paris) are probably companion pieces, in spite of the fact that the sitter is looking to the left in both of them. They share the same provenance until 1778. Thus: sale Rotterdam, 1713; sale Amsterdam, 1720; sale Amsterdam, 1729; sale Amsterdam, 1778. After 1778: in 1785, both paintings were brought to Paris by the art dealer Alexandre Joseph Paillet. He intended to sell them to the French king, but was unsuccessful. Sale Amsterdam, 1797; sale Amsterdam, 1803; collection Alexandre Dumont, Cambrai; collection Isaac Pereire, 1866; sale Pereire, Paris, 1872; collection Max Kann, Paris; sale Demidoff, Palais de San Donato, Florence, 1880; sale Ad. Jos. B�sch, Vienna, 1885. There acquired by the museum.In view of the fact that the Astronomer and the Geographer are probably pendants, and are the only works in Vermeer's oeuvre that represent male figures involved in scholarly pursuits, we are treating them conjointly.Until 1778, they remained together. The signatures and dates on both paintings are questionable, but they must have been executed toward the end of the 1660s.None of these paintings appears in the sale of 1696, and were therefore commissioned by a patron who was especially interested in astronomy or the celestial sciences. In both paintings, the references to books, scientific instruments, and, in the portrait of the Astronomer, the celestial globe by Jodocus Hondius, are accurately depicted.The latter painting features on the rear wall a picture representing the scene of the finding of Moses, which has been interpreted as being associated with the advice of divine providence in reaching, in the case of the astronomer, for spiritual guidance.Although farfetched, it is likely that the content of the painting is associated in some way with the meaning of the work. The sea chart on the wall of the Geographer does not have any religious association. It must be remembered that the rise of interest in scientific research at the time, fostered by the newly established University of Leyden, and philosophers like Descartes, did not have any specific religious associations. Quite to the contrary, the aim was to explore the universe, and simultaneously to further Dutch navigation in its conquest of faraway lands.Both paintings, with their interiors of scholarly studios and scientific paraphernalia, award Vermeer the opportunity for lightening effects that envelop the scientists in the mystery of an atmosphere that lifts their occupations into the realm of spirituality

14892-ascensio.jpg	The main scenes painted on the nave vault of San Sigismondo, near Cremona, are The Descent of the Holy Spirit (1557-59) by Giulio Campi, The Ascension of Christ (1549) by Bernardino Gatti, and The Resurrection of Christ and Jonah and the Whale (1540) by Domenico de Siccis.The traditional vault decoration of the fifteenth century was still a painted blue firmament, it might have evangelists, church fathers, prophets, sibyls, or saints, enthroned or merely floating. In the Sistine Chapel in 1508-12, Michelangelo painted illusionistic architecture filled with figures to serve as the frame for a cycle of biblical stories. This innovation did not find many followers at first. However, around the middle of the sixteenth century, barrel and cloister vaults were increasingly decorated with works that responded to Michelangelo's system for the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Painted ornamental articulations run across the entire vault and began to mark off fields for pictorial narratives and accompanying figures. One of the most astonishing solutions can be found in the monastery church of San Sigismondo, near Cremona. Transverse arches divide the main vault into three sections, each of which opens up to form a large pictorial filed on the ceiling panel. They were frescoed in sequence, starting from the crossing and moving toward the entrance wall

24432-expuls.jpg	"This fresco was cut at the top during the 18th century architectural alterations. This is one of the frescoes in the chapel which has suffered the greatest damage, for the blue of the sky has been lost.The scene has been compared to Masolino's fresco of the Temptation on the opposite wall. Masaccio's concrete and dramatic portrayal of the figures, his truly innovative Renaissance spirit, stand in striking contrast to Masolino's late Gothic scene, lacking in psychological depth. In Masaccio's painting man, although a sinner, has not lost his dignity: he appears neither debased nor degraded, and the beauty of his body is a blend of classical archetypes and innovative forms of expression.As far as Eve is concerned, one cannot help thinking of earlier interpretations of the Graeco-Roman ""Venus Pudica"" in 14th century (e.g. by Nicola Pisano). But Masaccio's Eve is only similar to them in her gesture, because her body expresses dramaticaly all the suffering in the world. Scholars have also pointed out the likely precedents for the figure of Adam (e.g. classical models such as Laocoon and Marsyas).And yet, all these borrowings from classical and more recent art were then used by Masaccio in a very personal way, to build up a totally original end product which must have truly impressed his contemporaries"

38201-saints.jpg	Memmingen, a Swabian town, gave a home to the Strigel family. The large-size altarpiece with outer wings hinged (which this panel belongs to) was made in collaboration by the two brothers Hans the Younger and Ivo Strigel. Ivo (b. 1430, Memmingen, d. 1516, Memmingen) painted altarpieces like his brother Hans II, and supplied them as far afield as Lake Constance, the Grisons and the Tyrol. He was variously referred to as a painter or sculptor, but the evidence gives no clear picture of the range or exact nature of his activities.The panel is a wing of the polyptych, which explains the grouping of the figures. Though these appear against a golden background decorated with a vigorously winding floral pattern, they stand on firm, realistic ground, bringing the group into a distant relationship with the Italian 'sacra conversazione'. The basic colours of the three figures' garments - black, crimson and green - melt into a tonal unity rarely encountered in German panels. The attribute of Florian, a house in flames, is much larger than the usual toy-like size of similar earlier representations, having started on the course from a symbol to a real object with a life of its own. It was evidently to counterbalance this increased volume that the artist decided to paint this saint's legs in tights which make the silhouette look slimmer, while the other two are covered by wide cloaks reaching to the ground

15918-shepherd.jpg	The Adoration of the Shepherds or the Allendale Nativity, as it is commonly known after one of the previous owners, is now generally accepted as by Giorgione. However, the debate on its attribution continues, with Bellini and the young Titian considered as possible authors. It is assumed by some critics that the landscape was painted by Titian.This important work had an immediate impact on Venetian painting. The composition is divided into two parts, the dark cave on the right and a luminous Venetian landscape on the left.

24427-0view.jpg	"The chapel in the right-hand arm of the transpt in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine is consacrated to the Madonna del Popolo, and a painting of the Virgin stands on the altar. The patrons of the chapel was the Brancacci family, from the second half of the 14th century until 1780. Felice Brancacci was the patron of the chapel from 1422 till 1436. He was a rich and powerful man and he commissioned the fresco decoration of the chapel in 1423 shortly after he returned from Cairo where he had been sent as Florentine Ambassador. It is assumed that work on the frescoes began in 1424, at a time when Masaccio and Masolino were working together, and that it continued until 1427 or 1428, when Masaccio set off for Rome, leaving the fresco cycle unfinished.The appearence of the chapel today is the result of alterations begun immediately after Felice Brancacci fell out of favour; he was exiled in 1435 and declared a rebel in 1458. Further changes were carried out in the 18th and 19th centuries.Originally the chapel was cross-vaulted and lit by a very tall and narrow two-light window; the last of the stories from the life of St Peter, his Crucifixion, was probably painted on the wall below the window, but this fresco was destroyed soon after Brancacci was declared a rebel so as to cancel all traces of a patron who had become politically embarassing. The chapel, formerly the chapel of St Peter, was reconsacrated to the Madonna del Popolo. It appears that Felice Brancacci was subjected to an operation of ""damnatio memoriae"", for all the portrayals of people connected to the Brancacci family were eliminated from Masaccio's fresco of the ""Raising of the Son of Theophilus"". The scene was then restored in 1481-82 by Filippino Lippi, who also completed the cycle.After the chapel was reconsacrated to the Virgin a number of votive lamps were installed: the lampblack they produced coated the surface of the frescoes, causing such damage that as early as the second half of the 16th century they had to be cleaned.In 1670 further alterations were carried out: the two levels of frescoes were divided by four sculptures set in carved and gilded wooden frames. It was probably at this time that the leaves were added to conceal the nudity of Adam and Eve in the two frescoes, Masolino's Temptation and Masaccio's Expulsion from the Garden. This was probably conceived during the reign of the bigoted Cosimo III.After several events, including a fire in 1771, a restoration combined with a thorough scientific investigation in the last decades brought the chapel to the state in which we can visit it nowadays.The fresco cycle, with the exception of the first two, tells the story of St Peter, as follows:Temptation (Masolino)Expulsion from the Garden (Masaccio)Tribute Money (Masaccio)Healing of the Cripple and Raising of Tabitha (Masolino)St Peter Preaching (Masolino)Baptism of the Neophytes (Masaccio)St Peter Healing the Sick with his Shadow (Masaccio)Distribution of Alms and Death of Ananias (Masaccio)Raising of the Son of Theophilus and St Peter Enthroned (Masaccio and Filippino Lippi)Disputation with Simon Magus and Crucifixion of St Peter (Filippino Lippi)St Paul Visiting St Peter in Prison (Filippino Lippi)Peter Being Freed from Prison (Filippino Lippi"

35472-10mythol.jpg	Ganymede was a shepherd, the son of Tros, a legendary king of Troy. His outstanding beauty caused Jupiter to fall in love with him. According to Ovid (Met. 10: 152-161) the god, having transformed himself into an eagle, carried the youth off to Olympus where he made him his cup-bearer. The myth, which is given in a slightly different version by Homer, found favour in ancient Greece because it appeared to provide religious sanction for homosexual love. The representation in Renaissance and later art shows Ganymede caught in the embrace of, or on the back of, the eagle which bears him upwards, its wings either spread in flight or enfolding the youth, its claws holding his limbs. Ganymede may carry a small wine jug in anticipation of his heavenly role. Another version shows his arrival at Olympus where Hebe, the former cup-bearer of the gods, relinquishes her cup to him.

10209-1paris5.jpg	Cranach was one of the most versatile artists of the Northern Renaissance, a staunch patron of the Reformation, and a close friend of Martin Luther. He painted didactic religious paintings, but he also produced his own erotic ideal of the female nude. Although his style, unlike that of D�rer, borrowed little from the Italians, he favoured mythological and classical subjects and painted the story of the Judgment of Paris many times during the course of his career.Here the artist has chosen a German version of the story, in which Mercury presents the three goddesses - Juno, Venus, and Minerva - to Paris in a dream. Cranach signals Venus's victory by placing Cupid, her son, in the upper left, aiming in her direction as she points to him. The figures of the three women give the artist an opportunity to make a visual tour of the female nude from different perspectives.Cranach's depiction of the subject was influenced by early prints.

18463-complain.jpg	In contrast with Chardin Greuze increased his popularity by taking his scenes out into villages and emphasizing the humble rank of his actors. The rustic fallacy was only one chord of falseness played on by Greuze. Anything that might have been a hint in Chardin becomes in Greuze an over-stated illustration: we must now witness those countless anecdotes with doves and broken mirrors in all of which there is a confused appeal to sentimentality and a lack of confidence in art that is unsupported by narrative. Greuze made the naive mistake that a moving anecdote will make a moving work of art. He begot a fearful progeny of nineteenth-century academic work throughout Europe from which came nothing except the problem picture. That he was quite capable of apprehending and conveying reality is shown by his often excellent portraits, but he wished to make some more striking contribution to art. He did indeed succeed in expressing something of the spirit of his age; he spoke the new language, as foreign to Chardin as to Boucher, of the heart

17186-3enviro1.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 661, JH 1871.To escape harassment from local inhabitants van Gogh left Arles in May 1889 and moved into a sanatorium, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, in the nearby village of Saint-R�my. There he hoped he would be able to work quietly and have medical supervision in case of a recurrence of his epilepsy. Saint-R�my lay beside the Proven�al hills known as the Alpilles, which are extraordinary geological formations, low-lying, rocky crags, weathered into grotesque shapes and pitted by ravines and waterchannels which have cut their way through the rocks. In the plains beneath them are fertile olive groves. Van Gogh was fascinated by this novel landscape. He was often able to go out from the hospital and paint and draw these unusual surroundings. He developed a more sinuous, linear style in drawing and a more flowing manner in painting in order to represent their special shapes and features.In Saint-R�my van Gogh gradually softened his palette too, entertaining the idea that in order to render his sense of the interrelation between the different elements of the landscape, tonality might be more appropriate than fierce colour contrasts. He cited the seventeenth-century artist Jan van Goyen in support of this redirection

03410-04adorat.jpg	From about the 1530s many Venetian pictures became much larger than the earlier works painted for some private space in the owner's home, probably because they were destined for the grander surroundings of reception rooms. This tendency is well illustrated by Jacopo Bassano's The Adoration of the Kings. Although he is one of the greatest representatives of the Venetian pictorial tradition, Bassano lived and worked not in Venice itself, but in the modest market town of Bassano on the Venetian mainland from which he derived his name.The painting presents a magnificent pageant as the three kings present to the newborn Child their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The painter's skill in portraying animals, unsurpassed among his contemporaries, is evident in the beautifully observed details of the ox and the ass, on the far left, and the dogs. But these, and the general bustle of the scene, are subjected to the formal order created by the semi-circular sweep of the composition, and by the decoratively repeating patches of intense colour; Bassano does not let his interest in animals and in slices of everyday life - such as the chatting boys and kneeling manservant - detract from the religious significance of the subject. The picturesque ruins on the left, for example, are certainly intended to be symbolic of the decay of pagan antiquity with the coming of Christ.The central figure in the painting, the king in the striped doublet may be identified as a portrait of the painting's patron, Jacopo Gisi. The two page-boys behind him may also be portraits of his sons

25118-8ursula.jpg	In 1903, the famous art historian J.M. Friedl&#228;nder attributed the Scenes from the Life of St Ursula, today in the Groeninge Museum, Bruges, to a painter he called the Master of the Legend of St Ursula. He saw this artist as a particularly talented disciple of Hans Memling and Rogier van der Weyden. In 1921 it was proposed that this anonymous artist was one Pieter Casembroot, a painter from Bruges who had apprenticed to Arnout de Mol, before becoming a master himself in 1459, none of whose works had hitherto been identified. Today, this hypothesis is widely accepted. Casembroot's most productive years were those between 1480 and 1500. We also know that, in around 1480, he began to receive so many commissions that he had to follow the example of his more illustrious colleagues and set up a studio in his own name

34218-oldmoney.jpg	Ribera, Lo Spagnoletto, was active in Naples where, influenced by the followers of Caravaggio, the master of tenebroso, he built up a pictorial world based on dramatic contrasts of light and shade. In representing a psychological phenomenon or a tragic situation he liked to utilize the possibilities offered by the wrinkles of the face. Like all painters of his period, particularly Spanish artists, he usually depicted religious themes. But he also liked to paint old people - for example imaginary portraits of writers and the sages of antiquity; and because he used brownish tints and emphasized the contrasting light and shade caused by facial wrinkles Ribera used to be called 'the Rembrandt of the South'. Although all such comparisons are usually pointless, it is true that Ribera's portrait of the old woman indicates an approach not unlike that of Rembrandt. It is a study of a character highly typical of the age, for in the seventeenth century money-lenders played an important role in the economic life of the country, in Italy as in the Netherlands.

42611-24young.jpg	"Signature: Not signed.Provenance:The catalog of the 1696 sale in Amsterdam enumerates three different tronies (one described as in antique dress) that may or may not be identical with this painting. Neither this young woman, nor the Girl with a Pearl Earring in the Mauritshuis, wears antique costume. People in the seventeenth century were sufficiently aware of Easterners, such as Turks, so as not to have mistaken a turban for an antique dress. The adducing of the Rotterdam sale, 1816, by Blankert, seems more probable. Certitude starts only with the painting's presence in the collection of Prince Auguste d'Arenberg, Brussels, 1829. Hidden during World War I (the d'Arenbergs owned vast estates in Belgium but had always retained their German citizenship. Hence, all their belongings there were seized after 1918 as ""enemy property"" and sold. The Vermeer escaped this fate), it was acquired by Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. Wrightsman, of Palm Beach, Florida, and Houston, Texas, in 1955. It was presented by them to the museum in 1979.This painting, as opposed to the Girl with a Pearl Earring, is very well preserved and permits us to judge Vermeer's approach, both technical and conceptual, in all its brilliance. Though more discreet, there is another pearl earring in this picture. The composition is also related to the other painting. Once again, we see this woman from the side, looking over her shoulder, though her face is turned further towards us. Her black hair is combed back severely from her forehead, and is plaited together with her (bridal?) veil. An additional variant is the position of her left arm, which is bent up against a parapet. Vermeer is following a style of portrait which was introduced by Titian's Ariosto. We certainly do not have here a portrait, but again, as in the Girl with a Pearl Earring, a generalized type that communicates with the spiritual world almost as if in a trance. This part of the painting is delicately executed, while the light-blue robe or loose cloak that the young person is wearing has been more broadly and crisply treated.Interestingly, this painting was certainly the prototype that inspired the Girl with a Red Hat in the National Gallery of Art, Washington (According to some critics this painting is not by Vermeer but a later pasticcio.)This painting of Vermeer does not enjoy as much favour as the ""Gioconda of the North,"" although it is, in many respects, a much better picture"

The authenticity of the two large-size biblical scenes is confirmed by drawings which have survived in Ricci's Venetian sketch-book. From their size and form it may be assumed that these pictures adorned the walls of a large room, and on the evidence of their style they were most likely painted in the 1720s. In the long and narrow field the artist built up his composition as a frieze; the figures are graceful and supple, their animation and vigour create a vivid rhythm, the grouping is loose but nevertheless powerful.

14430-105fried.jpg	"The Cross in the Mountains (The Tetschen Altar) brought Friedrich to the attention of a wider public. Probably at no other point in his life did Friedrich enjoy more profound appreciation and greater admiration than in the years around 1810. Two landscapes in particular were responsible for thrusting Friedrich into the limelight. In 1810 they were exhibited as pendants at the Academy exhibition in Berlin, where they were purchased by the Prussian Crown Prince Frederick William. These two paintings were The Monk by the Sea and the Abbey in the Oakwood.The Monk by the Sea is undoubtedly a masterpiece in Friedrich's oeuvre and the boldest picture within German Romanticism as a whole. The theme: the tiny figure of a man set against a natural landscape divided into three horizontal zones of colour. Its composition breaks with all traditions. There is no longer any perspective depth whatsoever. At the bottom of the picture, the whitish sand dunes making up the narrow strip of shoreline rise at an obtuse angle towards the left. At their apex, the tiny figure of a man robed in black is visible from behind - the only vertical in the picture. There is no other staffage; even the two sailing boats which Friedrich had originally envisaged on either side of the man he subsequently painted over. The oppressively dark zone of the sea meets an extremely low horizon. Some five-sixths of the canvas is given over to the diffuse structure of the cloudy sky. Because all lines lead out of the picture, infinity becomes the true subject of the painting. In the awareness of his smallness, the man, in whose place the viewer is meant to imagine himself, reflects upon the power of the universe.The official recognition, indicated by the royal purchase, came as a surprise, for the canvas had initially been met with bemusement, even from Marie von K�gelgen who had earlier admired his work. When she saw it in 1809, Marie described it to her friend Friederike Volkmann:""A vast endless expanse of sky ... still, no wind, no moon, no storm - indeed a storm would have been some consolation for then one would at least see life and movement somewhere. On the unending sea there is no boat, no ship, not even a sea monster, and in the sand not even a blade of grass, only a few gulls float in the air and make the loneliness even more desolate and horrible."

17510-1luke1.jpg	The painting comes from the Chapel of the Guild of St Luke in Sint-Romboutskerk, Mechelen. To the central panel with ogival-arch top, wings by Michiel Coxcie were added in the second half of the sixteenth century. Later it was on the main altar of St Vitus Cathedral in Prague.Gossart painted two versions of the subject, this is the earlier one, the second is in Vienna. The Prague version is Gossart's largest extant painting. The carefully planned architectural background is remarkable; in this painting Gossart presented the Guild of St Luke with the most up-to-date report on Roman art and architecture.In his presentation of the theme, Gossart referred to a famous painting by Rogier van der Weyden.

15156-02quarat.jpg	The central panel of the Quaratesi altarpiece shows the Virgin and Child. This panel is flanked by four saints each on a separate gabled panel (now in the Uffizi, Florence). Christ with his foreshortened halo leans out of the little roundel in the gable above the Virgin. All elements were further harmonised through subtle adjustments of composition and colour. Gentile's sumptuous decorative effects can now best be appreciated in the gold brocade, for the once-brilliant cloth of honour behind the Virgin and Child, painted translucent red over silver leaf and green over gold, has darkened and blotched with age.Despite its regal magnificence, the central group retains a graceful intimacy. The Virgin, an ideal beauty of her day with fair hair, broad forehead and rosebud mouth, looks out gravely as the Christ Child smiles contentedly, showing his tiny milk teeth. Keeping firm hold of his mother's cloak, he turns from her to the adoring angel, with a daisy - symbol of his innocence, picked in Heaven, the garden of eternal spring - held daintily between his pudgy finger and thumb

07178-canal222.jpg	The painting, together with five other views of the Piazza San Marco and the Piazzetta, forms part of a series commissioned from Canaletto by Consul Joseph Smith, who was the artist's most loyal patron. Smith, a merchant who lived in Venice, was not only an avid collector of Canaletto's work, but also arranged for the artist's paintings to be engraved and introduced him to potential clients. His collection, which included an incomparable group of paintings, drawings and prints by Canaletto, was sold to George III in 1762.The early views of the Piazza San Marco and the Piazzetta, dating from before 1730, comprise four vertical compositions and two of horizontal format. Conceived as a series, it is almost certain that they were hung in one of the rooms in the Palazzo Mangilli-Valmarana on the Grand Canal where Smith lived. Only two of the paintings look out from the Piazzetta. The present example shows the view across the entrance to the Grand Canal with the Baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute, designed by Baldassare Longhena, and the Dogana in the background.Canaletto has made several major adjustments in the disposition of the proportions of the buildings and other architectural motifs. The placing of the column of San Teodoro has been altered and its height has been increased. The steps of the bridge, the Ponte della Pescheria, by the Biblioteca Marciana have been brought forward. Similarly, on the other side of the Grand Canal, the Dogana is positioned in too close proximity to the Salute. Comparison with the preparatory drawing (Royal Library, Windsor Castle) shows that Canaletto originally included the column of San Marco on the left of the composition, but in the painting he omitted this in favour of a boat and instead inserted the column of San Teodoro by the Biblioteca Marciana. The balance of the composition is, therefore, heavily weighted to the right. These alterations to the spatial intervals and the amalgamation of viewpoints are highly characteristic of Canaletto's working methods. Such shifts of emphasis also confirm the likelihood that the paintings were made for a specific setting and that the compositions were closely discussed with the patron. Several changes (including the painting out of the column of San Marco) are visible to the naked eye. The paint is freely handled throughout, especially with regard to the figures in the lower right comer. The use made of mathematical instruments, mainly for drawing the outlines of buildings, is also apparent. The chiaroscural treatment of the light and the silhouetting of the buildings against the sky are the basis of the drama that characterises Canaletto's early style, especially in the paintings done for Consul Smith

35251-3madenth.jpg	A neurotic, even deformed stylisation that at times verges on the grotesque is the most immediate characteristic of Rosso Fiorentino's paintings, and can be glimpsed in this painting (the Ognissanti Altarpiece), executed  for the Hospital of S. Maria Nuova in Florence. Most notably, the restlessness of the whole work contradicts a High Renaissance ideal: that of serene majesty. This accentuates the expressive dynamism of his compositions, whose colours and tones seem burnt or lividly overstated. The almost infernal aspect of some of his characters has given rise to a number of sometimes wild hypotheses about the painter's far-from-happy psychology. (He committed suicide.)The altarpiece portrays the Virgin and Child between St John the Baptist, St Antony Abbot, St Stephen and St Jerome. The faces of saints, darkened by heavy shading, are utterly devoid of that serenity which characterizes the figures in traditional altarpieces. In the figure of St Jerome, the sunken abdomen, the prominent sternum, ribs and collar-bone of the chest area, and the skeletal thinness of the neck, arms and fingers, reveal unquestionable links with the studies of decomposing or flayed bodies that began to interest a great number of Tuscan artists from the 15th century

09205-youngman.jpg	Pieter Codde painted portraits, history paintings, and high-life scenes as well as military subjects. His small picture of a Young Scholar in his Study, painted in shades of silvery grey and ochres, is a kind of secularization of D�rer's Melancholia. It is more appealing than his more ambitious genre compositions, where he gives way to his preference for rather coarse and plump types, over-glossy textures, and exaggerated highlights. The rooms Codde represents are always of less interest to him than the people he placed in them, and although he lived long enough to see the accomplishments of the great Dutch painters of interiors - he died in 1678, three years after Vermeer - he never attempted to emulate their achievements. But he made at least one attempt to make a radical shift in his style. In the half of Frans Hals's Meagre Company he completed he made a concerted effort to emulate Hals's touch.

Closest to the chancel are Sts Basil, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nazianzus, venerated as hierarchs in Eastern Church. Secondary to them are the doctors of the church Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus, as well as the church fathers Athanasius the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. The eighth figure is St Nicolas of Myra.The patriarchs' bright colours and animated faces have been traced to Venetian precedents; however, the pattern for the overall arrangement could have been the fifteenth-century papal portraits in the Sistine Chapel. The distinct shadows the figures cast on the wall are prefigured there.The picture shows the niche which is located on the inner fa�ade. It is occupied by St Nicholas of Myra (Bari), pictured with a bishop's crosier and an open codex. This bishop does not belong to the groups of church fathers, his presence could be related to the fact that Nicholas was the name given to St Nilus at his baptism

14980-1paris01.jpg	When Gauguin returned to France in August 1893, penniless and sick, he settled in a studio in Paris with Annah the Javanese, a mulatto whom he had found wandering in the street and who soothed his nostalgia for faraway lands and races. He decorated his new abode with chrome yellow walls, hung with his paintings and those remaining works from his collection by other artists, including C�zanne and Van Gogh. The decoration also included numerous Polynesian works, which he had brought back, especially idols carved in unknown red, orange, or black woods.Despite her exotic name, the 13-year-old Annah was in fact Singalese. It is generally assumed that this work represents Annah with her pet monkey Taoa. The Tahitian inscription on the painting, which may be translated as 'the child-woman Judith is not yet breached', seems at first to have little relevance to the subject. It has been suggested that this refers to Judith Molard, the daughter of his friend William Molard, who was also 13 years old. Perhaps by depicting Annah with all the sangfroid of Manet's Olympia and referring to the sexually naive Judith in the title, he is poking fun at the constraints imposed by her bourgeois parents.

09877-courb215.jpg	"Among the paintings Courbet exhibited in the 1851 Salon was a self-portrait in which he seems to be judiciously eyeing the spectator. Man with Pipe represented the first important stage in his awareness of the direction that his artistic maturity would take.

26160-0245savo.jpg	The man is portrayed almost frontally and does not quite look us in the eye. His curly hair looks Italian. Over his red jacket he wears a black jerkin or tabard with grey lining. On a fourfold golden neck-chain hangs a cross-shaped jewel with precious stones and pearls. His hands rest on the edge of the painting, as if on the lowest ridge of the frame which has now disappeared. His coat-of-arms is on the reverse.Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont and Lord of Vaud from 1460 until his death in 1487, became a knight of the Golden Fleece on 30 April 1478. He was lieutenant-general under Charles the Bold and survived the defeat at Nancy in 1477. From here he fled to the Netherlands and entered the service of Mary of Burgundy and Maximilian of Austria. The fact that he is portrayed here without the chain of the order (also missing on the coat-of-arms) indicates that the painting must have been executed prior to 1478.The work was identified in the museum catalogue of 1901 as a copy of a lost portrait by Memling. The pose, landscape, physiognomy of the fingers and the stippled foliage are characteristic. The hard modelling, lacking in nuance, and the absence of detail suggest a minor artist along the lines of the Bruges Master of the Legend of St Lucy

36325-gregory.jpg	Formerly attributed to Caravaggio, but in the 19th century it was changed in favour of an attribution to Stern (a Flemish artist). Recently the painting was reassigned to an anonymous Italian imitator of Saraceni who was perhaps copying a lost work by the Venetian master.This painting can be identified with an entry in an unpublished inventory (dated 1802) of the Giustiniani collection, where it is listed as a work of Caravaggio (Vodret 1994). This attribution was maintained in the early Torlonia inventories until 1855, when it was changed in favour of an attribution to Stern (Vodret 1994). Longhi gave the picture to Saraceni, dating it to the second decade of the seventeenth century on account of its similarities to Saraceni's work in the Roman churches of San Lorenzo in Lucina and Santa Maria dell'Anima (Longhi, 1943). Ottani Cavina (1968) and Nicolson (1990), however, reassigned the painting to an anonymous Italian imitator of Saraceni who was perhaps copying a lost work by the Venetian master.The canvas is extraordinary for its compositional originality, the intensity of the pictorial material, the rapid execution and the vivacity of chromatic range. All these qualities point to Saraceni, one of the first followers of Caravaggio. Yet at the moment, despite its tight Caravaggesque observation, the painting does not seem to be attributable with certainty to the Venetian master, on account of stylistic differences between it and certifiable works of the painter like the Madonna and Child with Saint Anne (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). Nor is the name of the Flemish artist Stern sustainable at this time, though such an attribution is partially justifiable on the basis of the lucid optical rendering of the details.

From 1613, however, he is recorded in Rome, where he spent most of his career, which he dedicated to the painting of landscapes. Although landscapes were starting to assume some autonomy a full century earlier, in the works of the Venetian school and above all Giorgione, Lorrain nevertheless represents one of Italy's earliest and most important exponents of landscape painting as an independent genre. Starting from the classicist tradition, he elaborated an idealized landscape which would give rise to a whole school and which can be considered close to the art of Nicolas Poussin.This painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 71)

20716-bean_kin.jpg	Jordaens painted several versions of the subject, representing a popular custom, the feast of the Bean King.A merry company is gathered round a well-spread table, presided over by an old man with a crown on his head who is king for the day. This was the honour conferred by popular custom on the one who found the bean in the cake baked for this occasion, the feast of Epiphany, when ordinary people played at being the king and his court, as a safety-valve for dissatisfaction with the actual order of things. In the 17th century, this 'Bean Feast,' a celebration dating from the Middle Ages which Jordaens was the first to capture in paint, became a popular genre subject. The king's duties consisted mostly of raising his glass at regular intervals, when everyone else would do the same, with the shout 'The King drinks!' Given the general merriment here, this must already have happened several times.

32104-hacienda.jpg	From 1I637 to 1644, Post accompanied the retinue of Prince Johan Maurits of Nassau Siegen to Brazil, where he painted the landscape around Pernambuco and on a number of oceanic islands, as well as genre scenes of local life. This Dutch artist's sensitivity to specific situations, landscape and people make Post's Brazilian paintings an invaluable source of information regarding not only the flora and fauna of the region, but also the dress and customs of the time.On his return, Post settled in Haarlem and, like all his Dutch colleagues, he specialized, concentrating especially on tropical and exotic views. In his paintings, we note that, although he supplies details and specific information about this far-off land, the paintings themselves are nevertheless organized along the lines of conventional Dutch landscape paintings. The gaze of the spectator is drawn from the foreground into the depths of the landscape. This distant view with atmospheric changes and a large proportion of sky, are typical features of Dutch painting.

39715-1ferra3.jpg	"In 1516 Titian made contact with Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara for whom he was to work for a decade on pictures destined for the Alabaster Chamber. In this period he painted a series of magnificent paintings of Dionysian themes: the Worship of Venus in the Prado, The Andrians (Bacchanalia), also in the Prado, and Bacchus and Ariadne, in the National Gallery, London. In these paintings Titian combines a richness of colouristic expression with a great formal elegance. These are the elements which characterize this whole so-called ""classic"" phase of Titian's development and which is dominated by the supreme masterpiece of the Frari Assumption of the Virgin.The Bacchanal of the Andrians was the last in the series, The subjects are taken from classical descriptions of works of art: here Titian reproduces a picture the writer Philostratus saw in Naples in the second century AD, representing the people of the Greek Island of Andros making merry on the river of wine that Dionysus had created. This splendid opportunity to emulate the past was not lost on Titian, whose brilliant naturalism and marvellous colour declare him the equal of Apelles.The subject of this painting refers to the arrival of Bacchus on the island of Andros, where his followers await him in varying degrees of inebriation, as they drink from the island's river flowing not with water, but with wine. The god himself is not present, but his ship can be glimpsed in the distance and the Bacchanalian essence is exalted in the flask of wine held unsteadily aloft. The shifting shadows may evoke the checkered moods of intemperance, but there is no moral disapproval and the mood is elegiac and tolerant. The choice of subject may reflect not only the hedonism of the patron but also the agricultural prosperity of the Ferrarese countryside, replete with food and drink.The man leaning on his elbow in the centre derives from Michelangelo's Battle of Cascina cartoon, while the drunken nymph to the far right is based on a classical statue of Ariadne."

The peasants in this picture do not seem to be so poor and oppressed as those shown in other examples of the Dutch peasant genre; the home is comparatively well arranged and gives no suggestion of the hopelessness of a poverty-stricken life.The painting is signed lower right: A v Ostaade 1647

07441-onophriu.jpg	The attribution of this painting to Caracciolo is supported by most scholars. It is variously dated between 1610 and 1625. More recently, a possible connection was proposed between this painting and Cosimo Fanzago's statue of Isaiah in the church of the Ges&#249; Vecchio in Naples which Battistello seems to have used as a compositional source.The monumental figure of the saint, in spite of his apparently unstable pose, is perfectly balanced in the space of the picture. Standing in the centre of the painting, Onofrius's pose is a study in contrapposto movements. Caracciolo's use of light no longer annuls the details of anatomy, as it had in his work of the 1610's; but instead ably underlines the pictorial three-dimensionality with which the artist has sculpted the body of the saint. A beautiful passage, this nude is described with a pleasing formal forcefulness, without the characteristic indulgence of Ribera. The face, intense and vibrant, is rendered with rapid brushstrokes and with no attempt to hide the signs of old age. Instead, the face is transformed with a noble expressivity that is only accentuated by the severe, almost monochromatic handling of colour.

00377-02egypt.jpg	The Virgin is shown resting in a throne-like chair by a richly ornate Renaissance fountain, while Joseph proffers a basket of cherries. Several angels are playing in and around the basin of the fountain, and the child Jesus tries to reach into the water. The fountain-pillar is lavishly decorated with sculpture. The significance of the group of figures at the top - a bearded man with a boy shooting an arrow - is not clear, but appears to relate to ancient mythology. Beyond the fountain the wooded shores of a lake stretch far into the distance. The rocks are crowded with gateways, fortified roads and towers, houses with pointed gables, ruins and decaying roofs - all so intricately interwoven with trees and foliage that it is difficult to detect the relationship of any one building to the other.The element of fantasy, which so dominates the landscape, is also apparent in the fountain, in which the figures seem to be drawn both from reality and from the artist's imagination. There is no prototype or parallel in Altdorfer's time for the bizarre appearance of the fountain. The painter's artistic invention was sin this case at least a generation ahead of his time.At the foot of the fountain is a stone tablet bearing the Latin inscription: 'Albertus Aldorfer pictor Ratisponensis in salutem animae hoc tibi munus diva maria sacravit corde fideli 1510 AA' ('Albrecht Altdorfer, painter from Regensburg, for the salvation of his soul dedicated this gift to thee, divine Mary, with a faithful heart');.this indicates a very personal confession on the part of the painter, his appeal to the Virgin Mary. The dedication must also be taken as an explanation of the central feature of the picture, the fountain, which - though symbolic of a heathen place - is nonetheless the water of life for the Holy Family. The motif recalls the legend, according to which a spring appeared from the earth when the Holy Family in its flight sought a place to rest. A few years earlier Cranach had treated the same theme;this fact establishes a singular bond between the two paintings.It is assumed that the landscape reproduces impressions from the country near Regensburg, and in particular the hamlets of Scheuchenberg, Lerchenhaube and W�rth, which are also recognizable in Altdorfer's Crucifixion in the gallery at Cassel. The painter settled in Regensburg in 1505 and twenty years later was appointed the city's master-builder. Most of his pictures point to a predilection for architecture and architectural d�cor. An example of this is the highly imaginitive construction of the fountain and - on another panel in Berlin painted somewhat later - the ruin in the darkness which serves as the setting for the birth of Christ

12006-embrace.jpg	Dosso Dossi was court painter to Alfonso I d'Este, duke of Ferrara, and spent much of his career decorating his patron's various residences in and around the city. The Embrace belonged to a series of nine oval panels that were originally set into the gilt ceiling of the duke's bedroom in the so-called Via Coperta, a series of richly furnished apartments that linked the castle to the Palazzo del Corte. The ceiling was dismantled in 1598 and the panels were sent partly to Modena, and partly to Rome. In the seventeenth century the panels were transformed into rhomboid formats, and The Embrace was later cut down into its present octagonal form.The subject and the meaning of the picture is unclear, but depicting the tight and apparently forcible embrace by a bestial man (a satyr?), dressed in an animal skin, of a struggling naked woman (a nymph?), the picture seems to allude to the sin of lechery

24023-1presen.jpg	In 1453 or 1454 Mantegna married Nicolosia Bellini and in so doing allies himself professionally with her brother, Giovanni, to whom he imparts Donatellian ideas. The two London panels depicting the Agony in the Garden by Mantegna and Bellini respectively define the artistic interdependence of the two brothers-in-law: the technical innovations and organization of the Paduan painter and the pre-eminence of the Venetian in the field of light and colour.This is confirmed in the two versions of the Presentation at the Temple: the Berlin painting by Mantegna and the one in Venice by Bellini. Something of Quarcione's fierce expressiveness is evident in the face of Mantegna's High Priest (an element which is toned down in the Bellini version), and this, together with the Donatellian facial type of the Christ Child, points to the Paduan origins of both paintings. The foreshortened pose of Mantegna's Christ Child (less evident in the Venice version) is seen at an angle in relation to the back of the 'pictorial cube': by placing the Christ Child on the parapet the artist gives a measure of the space behind while at the same time projecting the Child into our space. This creation of a bridge between the work of art and the spectator is only evident in the Mantegna version. Only the spatial device of the ledge will appear again in Bellini's work.Furthermore, in the Berlin Presentation at the Temple the face emerging from the dark to the right of the painting is thought to be a self-portrait of Mantegna. Despite the discrepancies with the known Self-portrait Bust in bronze in Mantegna's funerary chapel in Mantua, it is difficult to deny that Mantegna has included himself in the Berlin canvas. And, if one accepts that the woman to the far left of the painting is a portrait of his wife it seems plausible that it is connected with the marriage of the painter

He used both intelligence and sensitivity in the way he implemented the Counter-Reformation dictates laid down by the Council of Trent. Lodovico tried to stick to simplicity and persuasion.The saint baring her neck for the executioner is a model of Christian virtues. These are exalted through her luminous beauty which contrasts with the brutality of the soldier to the left and the executioner himself (two figures which contain references to Titian, something so often found in Lodovico's work). The faithful looking at this picture are able to identify with the spectators below&#183; the scaffold and thus feel they are present at the scene rather than outsiders to it.The unusual foreshortening of the scaffolding, the bit of architecture that looms abruptly out of the background, and the broad opening into heaven where angels wait to receive the soul of the martyr, are quite remarkable

The trappings of mythology are increasingly only different wrappings for the same offering, guaranteed not to interfere with contemplation of the woman even if she is supposed to be Diana after the Hunt. Thus, while the stage is equipped with false trees or false doves, truth is present in the observation of naked bodies, draperies that set them off, and - most caressingly - in the texture of flesh conveyed by paint

35253-5descen.jpg	In this work the main character is the colour, and the colour is devoted to one end: a violent and emotional expressiveness which overrides everything else, and seeks only to provoke in the spectator a thrill of horror and grief comparable with that which shattered the men and women who helped to lift Christ from the Cross and bury Him.The drawing is not conceived as a means of describing forms, but as a means of stating ideas. The light is not a normal illumination nor even a poetic evocation: the scene is lit as if by lightning, and in the blinding flash the figures are frozen in their attitudes and even in their thoughts, while the great limp body of the dead Christ, livid green with reddish hair and beard, dangles perilously as his dead weight almost slips from the grasp of the men straining on the ladders.Rosso too acknowledges, as the Pontormo Deposition does, Michelangelo's Roman Piet&#224;, but the Christ of the Deposition is far more closely connected with a drawing for a Piet&#224; which Michelangelo made about 1519-20, and which haunted Rosso to the end of his life

42745-smalah.jpg	The Battle of the Smala was fought in 1843 between France and Algerian resistance fighters during the French conquest of Algeria. The French, led by Henri d'Orl�ans, duke of Aumale, raided the encampment (known as a smala or zmelah) of Algerian resistance leader Abd al-Qadir on 16 May 1843, while al-Qadir was absent on a raiding expedition. The 500 French cavalrymen surprised the camp defenders, who fired a single volley before scattering. More than 3,000 of al-Qadir's followers (out of a camp population of 30,000) were captured, as were many of his possessions, including his warchest and a library.

00126-merry_co.jpg	Pieter Aertsen was a Dutch painter who had a workshop in Antwerp for several years. He painted altarpieces, but also peasant scenes with a moralizing undertone and kitchen still-lifes with religious themes in the background. He continued this work following his return to Amsterdam in around 1557, concentrating henceforth more on the latter genre. This painting may have been produced during his Amsterdam period.The subject of the work has long been debated, although we can be sure it is not simply a peasant scene. it was once believed to be a portrait of the artist's family, but that hypothesis was rejected some time ago. The scene has all the elements of a rural booze-up. Much drink is being consumed, sausages grilled and bacon fried. There are festive biscuits on the table and a tray of waffles. Crowns like the one worn by the boy were used on the Feast of Epiphany, but also during other winter festivities, including Shrove Tuesday. Neither holiday is being celebrated here, however. The bird-cage next to the door on the left tells us that the scene is taking place in a house of ill repute, such as a tavern or brothel. Other elements combine to suggest the latter - the way the young man places his arm around the girl's waist, the copious eating and drinking, the aggression symbolized by the man with the two weapons, and the foolishness reflected by the king's crown. Like many of Aertsen's paintings, this work has both a moralizing and admonitory content, revealed by the presence of three men of different ages, each symbolizing a generation, around one woman.There is some remarkable innovation in this painting. The figures in the foreground are shown full-length in the middle of the small space, which, together with the monumental format, testifies to the emancipation of non-religious themes in painting around this period.

10125-16jerome.jpg	Albrecht of Brandenburg (1490-1545) was Elector and Archbishop of Mainz from 1514 to 1545, and Archbishop of Magdeburg from 1513 to 1545. He appears in the role of St Jerome in four paintings by Cranach. Two of them show the Church Father, alias Albrecht, in his study, and two in a landscape, though the latter two show him not as a penitent, but as an author, like the two indoor scenes.In the Middle Ages the Church Father Jerome, whose Latin translation of the Bible from early Hebrew and Greek texts is still in use and known as the 'Vulgate'(the generally familiar version), became one of the most prominent saints. One particular pictorial type was formulated, emphasizing his philological work and making him a role model, even among humanists: it shows Jerome as a cardinal in his study, working on texts.In Cranach's painting the spatial organization is undoubtedly drawn from D�rer's famous engraving of St Jerome in His Study of 1514, and the figure of Jerome is given the facial features of Cardinal Albrecht. This panel is one of the first examples of a new pictorial genre, the 'portrait histori�' or historiated portrait, in which the person portrayed takes on the role of a historical, biblical or mythological figure

18407-1907grec.jpg	This painting served as a sort of prelude to the great Adoration of the Shepherds (Museo del Prado, Madrid) El Greco planned for his own tomb. The idea of a nocturnal Nativity certainly originated with El Greco's recollection of Correggio celebrated altarpiece known as 'La Notte' (now in Dresden) and of certain paintings by the Bassano, both Jacopo and Francesco.El Greco's great paintings, like this Adoration, are ecstatic visions, in an unearthly light, with dreamlike distortions of forms, released from earthly perceptions. Mystics have spoken of luminous apparitions, poets have continually sought to reproduce dream faces in words: El Greco caught the visions of those in ecstasy and the magic imagery of the dreamers in line and colour, in exact recollection of the experience and without assimilation to the visible world. From the moment of the 'overcoming of sensual perception' El Greco's paintings are filled with an optical content which cannot be further explained, which defies all the laws of composition and colour and can no longer be tested by the proportions and optics of the tangible and visible world.Although the picture cannot bear comparison to the sublime Adoration for El Greco's tomb, it is superior to the reduced replicas that was made in his studio. (It should be, nonetheless, noted that this picture almost certainly involved the workshop, too.

16987-nuenen02.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 29, JH 471.In Nuenen between January and August 1884, van Gogh depicted the figure of the weaver working at the loom in several pen drawings, watercolours and oil paintings.

03957-bello100.jpg	A nephew and follower of Canaletto, Bernardo Bellotto applies the clear reporter's vision of the master to a slower and more intimate exploration of reality. And from his earliest works, Bellotto softens the formal rigour of Canaletto into natural, simple, concrete observations, and his brilliant, kaleidoscopic palette into a dense range of colours, tending towards the coldly bright. In the Rio dei Mendicanti the buildings of the left bank lie partly in shadow and partly in full sunlight. And beyond the bridge standing between light and shade, the dome of the Emiliani chapel in the church of S. Michele in Isola can be seen in the distance. On the opposite bank the corners of the Scuola of San Marco and the seventeenth century building in the foreground are darkened as the shadows of the hour before sunset gather.

03887-175madon.jpg	The painting represents the Virgin and Child and two figures: a woman praying and a figure who could be St Simeon. The painting may be a Sacra Conversazione (holy conversation), a subject developed at the end of the 15th century, but the figures, rather than conversing, seem to be united in a mystic communion. Their attitudes and expressions convey great peace and a meditative mood which bathes the whole painting: the landscape in the background is harmoniously formed from subtly graduating tones. There are no sharp contrasts and the light and shade is gently blended, creating a chromatic melody achieved through the rendering of the diffusely filtered atmosphere

35462-01mythol.jpg	After becoming a master in 1678, Rubens also produced paintings in addition to graphic works. His earliest work was very similar in style to that of Van Veen. This is apparent from the rare juvenilia which can on good grounds be ascribed to Rubens, such as the Battle of the Amazons in Potsdam. The classicist portrayal of the characters goes back to Van Veen, but bears witness to a better anatomical insight than is often the case with him.The Battle of the Amazons shows small figures in a landscape by Jan Brueghel, here Rubens followed the earlier and specifically Antwerp tradition of sharing out the tasks in landscapes with figures.

32423-shore.jpg	In 1908, the artists group Ash Can School (or The Eight) announced new bearings in 20th-century American art. Its members concentrated on the unappealing sides of modern urban life. Maurice Prendergast and Ernst Lawson tried to reconcile this subject-matter with a lyrical use of colour derived from Impressionism. The modernity of Prendergast's art did not reside in his subject-matter, it came from the priority he assigned technique over subject.Prendergast studied in Paris and readily absorbed Post-Impressionist aesthetics after 1890. His lively compositions guaranteed him success not long after his return to Boston in 1894.

35558-08artist.jpg	"In 1609 Rubens married Isabella Brant, daughter of the humanist and lawyer, Jan Brant, one of the secretaries of Antwerp. Shortly after his marriage, he lovingly portrayed himself hand-in-hand with his wife under a honeysuckle bower.About 32 years old, Rubens here presents himself together with his young wife Isabella in the accoutrements of chivalric elegance and in a state of happiness resulting from new love. The pair have sat down in the shade of a honeysuckle bower as if after a brief stroll, and are visibly enjoying the beauties of their metaphoric and natural ""situation"". He, now the grand seigneur, sitting with his legs crossed on a balustrade, is supporting with his right hand the hand of his wife, who is seated beside him on a grassy bank a little lower down. Each inclines slightly towards the other. She, while somewhat lower in the composition, is in no way his inferior in social rank, and lovingly takes his hand, casting a calm and friendly glance at the beholder. Ruff, Florentine hat, and brocade bodice casually emphasize, in combination with the angle of her head and the seated motif, the slight tension in the compositional bow which is further reinforced by her relaxed left arm and the fan she is holding in her left hand. This bow finds its response in her husband's bodily attitude, the position of his arm, and the gestures of his hands, while his orange hose leads a whimsical life of its own alongside her wine-red skirt.Rubens is portrayed looking over the beholder from high above, his facial expression is calm and contemplative. Both man and wife are visibly aware of what they have in each other, how precious their life together is, both as solemn matrimony and as natural romantic bliss. Everything around them is green and flourishing. At the bottom left, our own gaze is drawn into an extensive landscape. Following in the motif tradition of the ""garden of love"", Rubens in this picture summarizes his individual, family and artistic bliss"

37706-jerome.jpg	This work entered the National Gallery in 1952 as a work of the school of Ribera, an attribution that was accepted until 1997. Recently the artist was identified as Lionello Spada, on the basis of a citation in the inventory of the property ceded by Maffeo Barberini to his brother Carlo in 1623, immediately before the former's assumption of the papacy.Stylistically, the Barberini Saint Jerome differs significantly from the rest of the accepted production of Spada. A close connection is evident to the works of Ribera, to whom this painting was in fact once attributed. This would suggest that Spada encountered the Spanish artist in Rome; however Ribera's documented presence in the papal city from only 1613 onward does not match the proposed chronology of Spada's voyage there in 1608-09. This discrepancy opens new questions about the chronology of this Bolognese painter and the reconstruction of his career

38496-sisters.jpg	The group called The Ten American Painters was founded in 1898. To contemporaries, the group was quickly seen as the core of American Impressionism. It was created by Childe Hassam, John Twachtman and Julian Weir. The group included Willard Metcalf, Edmund Tarbell, Frank Benson, Joseph De Camp, Thomas Dewing, Edward Simmons and Robert Reid. William Chase joined the group in 1902 after the death of Twachtman. The interest of the group was in the annual public exhibition of work that shared an aesthetic thrust. The Ten survived for almost twenty years till it was dissolved in 1917.1890s Impressionist art in Boston was primarily concerned with figure painting, and focused on society ladies in appropriate settings. Tarbell was one of the first to take this direction. His compositions of the 1890s, showing stylish ladies at leisure out of doors, adopted the entire colour spectrum of French Impressionism, and indeed occasionally enhanced it as  in the glows to be seen in his subjects' faces

25335-virgin.jpg	St Verdiana (died 1222 or 1242), who was a lay recluse, is the patron saint of the town of Castelfiorentino outside Florence. She made a pilgrimage to Rome and on returning home entered a cell where she was molested by serpents, but where she remained until her death. She is generally represented in painting as a middle-aged nun with two snakes and a basket.Formerly this painting was attributed to an anonymous Florentine painter referred to as the Master of Santo Spirito who was active towards the end of the fifteenth century and who was named after the three important altarpieces he executed for the church of Santo Spirito. The body of paintings and drawings ascribed to this master was later convincingly linked to the Florentine workshop of the brothers Agnolo and Donnino del Mazziere

24885-gilles2.jpg	The painter, named after his pictures in the National Gallery, must have been trained in the Netherlands but worked in Paris at the turn of the fifteenth century. This panel was once part of a larger altarpiece which it has not been possible to reconstruct, although it must have included the Saint Gilles and the Hind shown nearby, and probably two other paintings of similar size now in Washington, one depicting the lower chapel of the Sainte-Chapelle, the other the square in front of Notre-Dame in Paris. The scene painted here has been set before the high altar of the Abbey of St-Denis near Paris, whose interior as it appeared around 1500 it documents with great accuracy, although the miracle shown is said to have taken place in 719, possibly in Orleans.The story is told in the Golden Legend, a thirteenth-century compilation of saints' lives. The Frankish King Charles Martel had committed a sin which he dared not confess. He asked Saint Gilles to pray for him. On the following Sunday, while Saint Gilles was celebrating Mass on behalf of the king, shown kneeling at a prie-dieu on the left, an angel placed a paper on the altar; on it was written the king's sin and a pardon obtained through the saint's prayers, conditional upon the king's repentance.The gold gem-studded altarpiece in front of which Saint Gilles officiates was presented to the Abbey by King Charles the Bald (823-77); it is mentioned in an inventory of 1505 and remained in existence until the French Revolution. First used to decorate the front of the altar, it would have been moved to the back of the altar table in the thirteenth century, when a change in the liturgy made it desirable to provide a backdrop for the elevation of the host - the bread of the Eucharist - which we see Saint Gilles holding up for the king, and us, to adore. Above the altarpiece is a cross made by Saint Eloy, seventh-century Bishop of Noyon, goldsmith and patron of goldsmiths. The small reliquary at its foot contained a fragment of the True Cross. The copper angels holding candlesticks, and standing on brass pillars that support the green curtains around the altar, were also listed in the inventory of 1505.Behind the altar we glimpse the gilt brass coffin of Saint Louis mounted on tall columns, constructed in 1398 and given to the Abbey by King Charles VI. On the right, half cut off at the edge of the picture, is the mid-thirteenth-century tomb of King Dagobert (died 639) which is still in situ, albeit heavily restored. Even the crown worn by Charles Martel may depict an actual object stored at St-Denis, the Sainte Couronne used to crown every king of France until it was destroyed in the late sixteenth century. We can be sure that the precious oriental carpet in front of the altar, the patterned textiles of altar front and vestments, the book bags and cushions, record real accessories. While many Netherlandish paintings give the appearance of truthfulness, it is extremely unusual in this period to firid such an accurate description of an actual site. It would be pleasing to think that the sharp-eyed ecclesiastic holding back the curtain behind the king was the anonymous Master of Saint Gilles, inviting our admiration as well as our prayers

17951-winter.jpg	Despite his strong reputation, van Goyen was unable to provide for his family on an artist's income. With varying degrees of success, he also traded tulip bulbs, brokered real estate, and acted as an appraiser for auction houses. Meanwhile his painting evolved, and he produced his best works in the early 1640s at The Hague. Using lighter and brighter paints and, most importantly, unifying the view through a general tone in which the grey-blue hues of sky and water predominate, van Goyen conveys well Holland's distinctive maritime atmosphere.In the background the outlines of the large municipal buildings of The Hague (Stadthuis, Groote Kerk and Binnenhof) can be seen.

The refined, attenuated forms of the figures may derive from Mannerism, and the palette and the taste for ruins from Northern Europe, probably through Pieter Aertsen, but what makes the picture datable around 1550 is the loving, closely observed naturalism with which the animals have been depicted, a characteristic common to an entire group of Bassano's paintings

Del Monte purchased the building in 1596.On his eagle, Jupiter swoops down towards Neptune and Pluto, who are standing at the opposite edge of the ceiling, as if he were making the sky light up with a crystal ball. Any interpretation of the gathering of the gods, seen - unusually - from below, must shift between mythology, astrology, alchemy and even the Christian doctrine of salvation. An oddity in the artist's work, this ceiling painting does not fit into any stylistic category.

Two of these were carried out in the 17th century: one by Tintoretto's son, Domenico (1602) who redid the lower part from the young woman to the old woman turned towards Christ, and one by Lelio Bonetti (1696) and they were not removed during the restoration work in 1947 for methodological reasons.Under the thick curtain of a vine pergola, Christ, depicted in light and shadow on the right, bends over the paralysed man and frees him from all ills, while around the big pool of water the large crowd of sick people sit trustingly

03735-doge.jpg	Gentile Bellini was the most important portraitist in Venice until the 1490s. Five portraits of doges by him survived. Between about 1460 and 1500 he was charged with creating the official portrait of each of the doges, from Pasquale Malipiero (1392-1462) to Leonardo Loredan (1436-1521)The present portrait, the sitter of which can be identified as Pasquale Malipiero, belongs to Gentile's early works.

15447-3brozzi2.jpg	The fresco is in the tympanum above the Madonna and Child with Saints. Two angels are kneeling on the left bank of the river Jordan, shown as a little flat stream flowing towards us. They are holding the clothes of the person being baptized, who is clad only in a loincloth. Christ is standing in water up to his ankles. St John the Baptist, in a fur robe, is gathering up his cloak and stepping carefully on to a stone to baptize Christ.This fresco, because of its poorer quality, is frequently attributed to assistants from Ghirlandaio's workshop. It is a loose copy of the famous panel painting which Verrocchio painted with the help of his assistant Leonardo da Vinci. Ghirlandaio added the two praying angels on the right of his composition, and these, together with the corresponding figures on the other side of the river, form a compositional frame for the work.. This assumption that clear symmetrical balance is important shows that the artist was still rather conservative

At least four old copies are known, two by Jan Stolker (1724-85). The others are known from two close tracings of the eighteenth century.""The Lacemaker"" is another small scale painting, nearly dwarfed by its impressive wooden frame. Unlike the more contemplative figures in Vermeer's work, the subject here is very active, intensely focused on a physical activity. As opposed to the full-figure compositions, where furniture and drapery act to facilitate or deflect the viewer's visual entry, ""The Lacemaker"" brings the subject dramatically to the foreground. As a result, the viewer is drawn into a powerful emotional engagement with the work.  Although the composition is quite shallow, there are different depths of field that draw the viewer into the canvas. The forms nearest the eye are unfocused, which encourages the viewer to pass on to the more distinctly defined middleground. The intimacy is accentuated by the small scale, personal subject matter, and natural composition. The lacemaker's total preoccupation with her work is indicated through her confined pose. The use of yellow, a dynamic, psychologically strong hue, reinforces the perception of intense effort. Contrasts of form serve to animate the image. For example, her hairstyle expresses her essential nature - both tightly constrained and, in the loose ringlet behind her left shoulder, rhythmically flowing. Another strong contrast exists between the tightly drawn threads she holds and the smoothly flowing red and white threads in the foreground. The precision and clearness of vision demanded by her work is expressed in the light accents that illuminate her forehead and fingers. The diffused ocular effect of the foreground objects, especially the threads, was definitely derived from a camera obscura image. Vermeer used the informal, close framing of the composition suggested by the camera obscura to accentuate the realistic, immediate impact of the painting. Contemporary Dutch painting portrayed industriousness as an allegory of domestic virtue, While the inclusion of the prayer book pays fealty to this theme, it is a secondary concern to the depiction of the handicraft of lacemaking, and, in the highest sense, the creative act itself. Once again, Vermeer succeeded in transforming a transitory image into one of eternal truth"

00927-20louvre.jpg	This altarpiece, exhibited now in the Mus�e du Louvre together with its seven predella pictures, was executed for the church San Domenico in Fiesole, and it is one of the most famous of Fra Angelico's works. It is a good example of the painter's art of tempera painting with fresh colours that have not changed. On the predella the story of San Domenico is depicted.In this altarpiece Fra Angelico departs markedly from his usual methods of space projection, but this can be explained by the extreme difficulty of integrating so complex a composition as a traditional Coronation, into the type of space he had recently employed. The whole, although still a heavenly scene, is set on terra firma. The sky is a realistic blue and not gold. The very low view-point enables the assembled saints and angels to be placed in a series of tiers without obscuring one another. The figures in the foreground kneel so as not to attract undue emphasis. Mary Magdalen holds out her jar of oil, marking the central axis.Recently a date of 1450, which is considered compatible with the internal dating evidence of this altarpiece, is suggested

07566-45death.jpg	This, the largest picture that Caravaggio had yet produced, did not end up in the place for which it was made. In 1602 a papal legal adviser, Laerzio Cherubini, commissioned a Death of the Virgin for the Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala in Trastevere; it was to be finished by 1603. When they saw it, the friars found it alarming, because the Madonna was modelled on a prostitute with whom Caravaggio was in love (according to Mancini), because her legs were exposed (Baglione), because her swollen body was too realistic (Bellori) - for whichever reason, they felt prompted to reject it. After Caravaggio had left Rome, Rubens urged his master, the Duke of Mantua, to buy it. Along with the rest of the movable Gonzaga collection it was bought by Charles I of England and, after he had been executed, was sold to Louis XIV. What the friars could not endure was favoured at court.The painting is severe, sad and still. Under a red canopy hanging from a barely visible ceiling, the disciples are grouped round the corpse (fixed on a bed in rigor mortis), most standing to the left. Light coming from a window high on the left picks out their foreheads and bald pates, before falling on the upper part of the Virgin's body. Above her stands the young, mourning St John the Evangelist who had been given special charge of her; in front, the seated Mary Magdalene stoops forward and almost buries her head in her lap.In the predominant colours - red, orange, dark green - Caravaggio uses a slightly wider range than in his later, darker Roman paintings, but nowhere else did he achieve a mood of such overwhelming solemnity. Mary's companions, her Son's followers, are struck dumb by their grief, like relief sculptures on antique tombs. There is no suggestion that their sorrow will be turned into joy or that Mary will be assumed into heaven

07267-canal717.jpg	This is another fine example of the type of capricci Canaletto executed during his sojourn in England. It is one of a group of paintings known as the 'Lovelace Canalettos', so-called because they were sold in 1937 by the Earl of Lovelace. He had inherited them from Lord King who probably acquired them in the eighteenth century for his home, Ockham Place in Surrey.This work is an ingenious combination of Italian and English influences - a fitting project for Canaletto to work on prior to his final return to Venice, after having spent nearly a decade in England. The general disposition of the hilly landscape and the vegetation appear English, and a bridge inspired by Westminster Bridge has been placed in the middle distance. The Corinthian column, however, decorated with an escutcheon and surmounted by a statue of a saint, and the triumphal arch, are clearly Italianate. The juxtaposition of these two sets of references cleverly and subtly encourages you to question what is real, and what is imagined

05847-1lastsu.jpg	The Last Supper is remarkable for its stylistic purity and sobriety. The faces of the apostles do not vary greatly. Their gestures seem to have been frozen at a particular point in time. It is an important moment, and those present seem to be meditating on its significance. This superbly glacial and hieratic aspect of the style contrasts with other elements that are equally present, and more down-to-earth, prefiguring the realism of a Van der Goes. Two honest servants in the far left hand corner of the room are observing the proceedings through a hatch from the kitchen. Together with another figure - who may represent the painter himself and who stands by ready to wait on Christ and his disciples - they serve to place this momentous scene firmly in the context of everyday life.The real novelty of this extraordinary painting lies in its systematic application of the laws of perspective. Jan Van Eyck and Rogier Van der Weyden had already used perspective, but only in interior scenes that were much simpler than this Last Supper. They had done nothing as complex or as perfect as the architecture of this central room. Moreover, the space is not entirely enclosed, for the outside world is visible at two points: once through the windows to the left, through which distant houses are visible, and again through the arch at the back of the room. This latter opening gives onto an enclosed garden painted in blue and pink tones, as if space were stretching out across it towards an invisible horizon. The trapezoid of the white table cloth, the distribution of the figures around it and their convergence on the central figure of Christ, as well as the subtle rhythm of the different colours, all conspire to endow this complex composition with a profound pictorial unity

07073-1niobid.jpg	Painted at the commission of Urban VIII's nephew Taddeo Barberini, the two large canvases, The Massacre of the Niobids and The Hunt of Diana were recorded in 1648-49 as hanging in his residence in the Via dei Giubbonari. Later, between the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth centuries, they were transferred to the Palazzo Barberini alle Quattro Fontane, where they were definitively recorded in 1817.On the basis of payments to Camassei recorded in the Barberini account books for the Hunt of Diana, the paintings can be dated to 1638-39. It was Cardinal Bentivoglio who originally introduced the artist to Prince Taddeo, who became the artist's patron and protector.Many of the details of Camassei's treatment of this rare subject derive from a famous precedent, the Hunt of Diana that Domenichino executed in 1617 for Scipione Borghese. Nevertheless on a stylistic level Camassei detaches himself from his model, working in a manner that clearly shows the influence of the Roman neo-Venetian trend of the 1630's. Poussin was the most authoritative representative of this movement, and indeed the figure reclining at the left of Camassei's Massacre of the Niobids seems to derive directly from a counterpart in Poussin's Death of Adonis. The figures in Camassei's painting, with their sculptural quality, have also been connected to a relief by Perrier at the Villa Medici.The dramatic narrative of the Niobids, in which the mortal Niobe is punished for insulting the goddess Latona, comes from Ovid's Metamorphoses. When Niobe boastingly compared her seven offspring to Latona's mere two, the angry goddess retaliated by sending her children Apollo and Diana to slaughter Niobe's brood. With his compositional and formal choices, Camassei treats the scene almost like a genre picture, depriving it of some of its inherent high drama

30816-mad_sts.jpg	From the church of S. Domenico at Fiesole. Signed and dated. A work the fame of which is in excess of its actual artistic worth. It expresses an entirely exterior religious feeling by means of elements which are merely illustrative rather than definitely figurative, and is somewhat lifeless.Perugino was in demand during the last decade of the fifteenth century, particularly for religious altarpieces such as this one. He specialized in a type of Madonna that is approachable, youthful, and sweet. She sits on a high-based throne with a Roman-style decorative frieze. A strong architectural background provides compositional stability to the two standing saints framing the Virgin and Child

15152-adormago.jpg	This is the left scene of the predella on the large altarpiece Adoration of the Magi.In this scene the luminous radiance emanating from the body of the Christ Child suffuses the central part of the small panel, bathing the figures and the landscape in a soft glow that is as much a depiction of natural moonlight on landscape forms as it is a manifestation of the supernatural. The light extends to the left edge of the panel where it casts distinct shadows on the shed framing the two reclining women there. A comparable depiction of the divine through the carefully observed natural phenomena of light appears in the upper right of the panel where the angel appears to the shepherds to announce the birth of Christ

15871-psyche4.jpg	Venus punishing Psyche with a Task (?) was previously interpreted as Psyche visited by her Sisters, but Sir Michael Levey argues that the scene is more accurately identified as Venus setting Psyche a task in the attempt to find Cupid. The task in question may be that of procuring a flask of water from a stream running beneath a high mountain. Venus is the lightly clad figure in the middle pointing towards Psyche, whose own gesture indicates the mountain in the background. As such this scene is the last of those in the present series

16984-3drenth1.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 17, JH 395.Van Gogh decided to become a professional artist in the summer of 1880; but it was not until the autumn of 1883 that he seriously took up oil painting. He had been experimenting with oil during his stay in The Hague, whose modern urban life he had tried to depict, but not to his satisfaction. In September 1883 he moved out of the city to the northern province of Drenthe, where he painted this study of moss-covered thatched farm buildings. The move to Drenthe marked Van Gogh's decision to take rural life and labour as the subject of his art. Both of these required a new style of work, facilitated by oil paint.Van Gogh's initial investigations of landscape painting were awkward; small and tentative in scale, painted thickly in deep tones. Most of the paintings are, with few exceptions empty of the people who worked and shaped the landscape. Space is minimal and there is little sense of distance. The viewpoint is low and close, and the resultant paintings do not convey the spaciousness of the Drenthe landscape which Van Gogh so often described in his letters to his brother

14448-212fried.jpg	This painting, with its bold composition, was probably purchased by the future Tsar Nicholas I in 1820, when he visited Friedrich in Dresden.As if we ourselves were on board, our eyes are directed towards the prow of the boat, where a couple are sitting. They are holding hands and gazing at the distant city ahead, its church spires and buildings emerging hazily from the mist. The woman is Caroline, the artist's wife, and the man is probably intended to be Friedrich. The artist is possibly referring here to the motif of the ship of life, to the notion of life as a journey from this world to the next, as familiar from Christian pictorial and literary tradition. The picture is dominated, however, by the emotional span between the narrowness of the boat, the way in which it seems to be gliding soundlessly forwards, strangely without waves, and the longed-for horizon. Dominant, too, is the bold composition with its slightly offset verticals (the mast), its horizontals (the distant shore) and its foreshortened view of the wedge-like front of the ship. It would be several decades before a close-up view of this kind would be encountered again in the work of the Impressionists.

18019-30old.jpg	The oldest king is closest to the Christ Child on the altarpiece and is followed by the largest procession of pilgrims. His vanguard is made to appear visually longer due to the about-turn that the procession makes. He is wisely and calmly gazing towards the young king on the opposite wall. His long gray full beard shows him to be from the Middle East, for the Florentines of the 15th century, where a smoothly shaved face was the predominant fashion, considered this to be the decisive characteristic of the Orient.The figure of the old king has been considered to be a portrait of the patriarch of Constantinople. The identification is based on the context in which the paintings were produced: the Council of Ferrara-Florence in 1439. The council, which had at first met in Ferrara, was moved to Florence as Ferrara was not able to provide further financial support or security. It was possible to move the council due to financing provided by the Medicis, in particular Cosimo. Since 1438 he had been the 'Gonfaloniere della Giustizia' (Standard-bearer of Justice), the head of the eight priors who together formed the constitutional body. Because of this position, Cosimo was able to prepare for the council and the reception of the dignitaries. One of the results was a decisive financial success, a year of high profits for the Medici bank. In this context, therefore, painting the chapel was also meant to serve as a reminder of the brilliant part Cosimo had played in the affair. The council had not successfully carried out its aims, in the long term the council was to be unsuccessful, however, this had not yet been evident during the 1440s and 1450s. At that time the discussion was continued in Rome and not until 1484, more than 50 years after the frescoes were completed, did the Greek Orthodox Church finally reject the agreement reached in Florence

39525-family.jpg	Tischbein used the group of his wife and two daughters from an earlier work, but extended the composition to include his own self-portrait. In the nineteenth century, under the instructions of Tischbein's youngest daughter Betty (1787-1867), seen here as a child sitting on her mother's lap, his self-portrait was painted over and two sides of the canvas cut down in order to reconfigure the composition with the mother and daughters at centre. This 'reworking' was only discovered in 1975 during the restoration of the work when the green curtain painted over Tischbein was removed and his likeness once again revealed.The family portrait was commissioned in 1796 by Prince Johann Georg (1748-1811), brother of the ruling Duke Leopold III Friedrich Franz von Anhalt-Dessau (1740-1817)

14897-webster.jpg	The sitter of this portrait, Elizabeth, Lady Webster, later Lady Holland (1770-1845), is depicted seated full-length, in a white dress and feathered hat, with her spaniel Pierrot, on a 'chaise-longue,' with a guitar, in an interior. Lady Holland was one of the most influential women of her generation and it was due in large measure to her forceful personality that their home in Kensington, Holland House, became the undisputed centre of the Whigs' political and intellectual life until her husband's death in 1840.The painting is signed, inscribed and dated lower left: L. Gauffier. Flor. ce 1795

06473-20innoce.jpg	There are two versions of this composition by Bruegel. The original is probably the painting in the Royal Collection at Hampton Court Palace, but that panel is considerably damaged and repainted. The version in Vienna appears to be a workshop replica, perhaps completed by Bruegel himself. Both were painted around 1565-7.As in the Procession to Calvary, Bruegel depicts a biblical event in contemporary terms. In this case he shows the sacking and plundering of a Flemish village. Such scenes were of course only too tragically familiar in Flanders during Bruegel's lifetime, but it is unlikely that the painter intended to condemn a particular act of Spanish aggression. Bruegel was delivering a more general condemnation of war and the individual acts of atrocity which war condones

29507-augustin.jpg	In the age of humanism the view of St Augustine changed. Augustine combined classical scholarship and an admiration for Plato and the art of rhetoric with the eager faith of early Christianity.

03502-extasy.jpg	"Pompeo Batoni was a very cultured man who gained international fame at an early age. He was the first Italian artist consciously to work out a formal alternative to Rococo art and Venetian painting, which he felt to be outdated. He trained in Rome where he studied Raphael and classic Renaissance art. He quickly came up with a ""reform"" program for painting along controlled academic lines. He set out to provide a series of paintings that could be used as a model for religious art. In his paintings each figure is posed in a composed fashion. With the work of his rival Anton Raphael Mengs, Batoni's art marked the first beginnings of Neo-Classicism, in an urbane, highly polished, if very derivative manner.If we compare works on similar subjects (for example The Ecstasy of St. Francis by Piazzetta), we can measure the cultural change that Batoni was proposing.The great sense of movement contained in compositions by artists in the first half of the century could also be seen in the speed with which they painted. This was now subjected to a rigorous check. Everything was controlled and expressed in impeccable form at the cost of losing much emotional intensity. After the middle of the century, this academic way became the main influence on painting in central Italy"

40032-brothe15.jpg	Towards the end of 1892 Lautrec was commissioned to produce decorations for the salon walls of the Rue d'Amboise brothel, and he decided to design 16 panels in the style of Louis XV, each one centring on an oval portraits of one of the girls. It was during this time that Lautrec had the opportunity to study their lifestyle at close quarters.He was fascinated to discover that many of them were deeply in love with each other, and he frequently made these couples the subjects of his paintings. He thereby succeeded in portraying the genuine depth of these lesbian relationships without exposing the girls' tenderness and helplessness to voyeurism.The woman half turning away in the foreground was known by the name of Gabrielle, and she modelled for Lautrec in a number of his paintings. It is not certain whether she was a prostitute or a model, or both, and it is therefore not clear whether the scene portrayed here was one observed by chance in a brothel, or a pose set up in the studio. It is possible that Lautrec was simply hinting at the current fashion in the brothels for guests of both sexes to pay to watch the lesbian love-play of the prostitutes

14442-208fried.jpg	Soaring high above the town, which is seen in silhouette from the north-east, is the slender spire of the Marienkirche. The hilly landscape on the horizon, above which grandiose banks of clouds unfurl into an enormous sky, is the product of pure imagination. This has led some art historians to conclude that the work is not intended as a straightforward veduta, but as a glorification of Gothic Neubrandenburg. The two men on the track in the foreground stand motionless beside what is probably a dolmen and contemplate the cityscape in the distance. Opinions differ as to whether the lighting conditions represent sunrise or sunset. Like the bushes shedding their leaves in the foreground, the migratory birds in the sky, probably storks, serve as pointers to approaching winter and thereby to death

31481-rosso2.jpg	The Palazzo Brignole Sale (dubbed Palazzo Rosso because of the colour of its stucco exterior) was erected between 1671 and 1679 on the prestigious Strada Nuova (present-day Via Garibaldi) in Genoa. The decoration of the palazzo was accomplished in two phases. In 1687-89 the team of Domenico Piola and Gregorio de Ferrari - with the assistance of Niccol&#242; di Viviano Codazzi (1642-1693), Antonio Maria Haffner (1654-1732) and Sebastiano Monchi (c. 1630-1706) - painted the east wing, including the south loggia, then in 1691-92 the frescoes in the rooms of the west wing were executed by Giovanni Andrea Carlone with the assistance of Antonio Maria Haffner and Carlo Antonio Tavella (1668-1738). The quadratura painter Antonio Maria Haffner worked both for the Piola-Ferrari and Carlone teams.The works by Piola and Ferrari in the east wing, the four rooms on the third floor dedicated to the Four Seasons, are considered the highlights of the entire decoration. The ceiling paintings of the Seasons, striking in their vivid colours and their synthesis of influences from Correggio and Pietro da Cortona, are among the most successful achievements of Genoese painting from the High Baroque.The cycle of the seasons was a favoured subject in room decoration. The cycle illustrated in the Palazzo Rosso deviates from the traditional iconography, replacing the familiar pictorial motifs with deities and personifications. Spring is represented by Mars and Venus, presented as contrary forces suggestive of the months they dominate. The image and spirit of summer are embodied  by an extremely foreshortened Apollo-Helios, barely recognizable against the glowing sun, and a lion symbolizing summer's zenith. Autumn is personified by Bacchus with Ariadne and his train made up of satyrs, Maenads, and cupids. Personifications of the cold winds Eurus, Borea and Austro represent winter.The allegories for Spring and Summer were executed by Gregorio de Ferrari.

07767-40betrot.jpg	"Canvas No. 4 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".The Meeting of the Betrothed Couple and the Departure of the Pilgrims, signed and dated 1495, is the largest painting in the cycle and actually contains six different episodes of the legend. To the left Ereus takes leave of his father; to the right of the pennant, on top of which the banner is shown blowing in the wind, we see the betrothed couple at their first meeting, as they take their leave from Ursula's parents, as they board the twelve-oared sloop and then the ship; to the left we see the ship again, its sail billowing in the wind, and the inscription MALO is rather like a foreboding of the tragic fate that lies ahead for the pilgrims.In the most natural way all the various moments of the story follow on each other without interruption, within the carefully constructed composition. Within this unitary space, the free and varied vibration of the lighting makes even the smallest details totally plausible, created as they are by brushstrokes of unfailing precision. This kaleidoscopic pageant also contains very realistic elements, such as the two towers of the Knights of Rhodes and St Mark of Candia, probably modelled on woodcuts by Reeuwich illustrating the Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam by Breydenbach that was printed in Mainz in 1486; Carpaccio has placed these two towers on the steep slopes of the hill protected by walls, towers and castles.While the English city is surrounded by an impregnable set of walls and towers, on the other side of the canvas the city in Brittany stretches out totally defenceless, built along the water's edge, full of buildings with elegant marble facades. These are clearly reproductions of the palaces that Codussi and the Lombardo brothers were building in Venice towards the end of the 15th century and which were rapidly changing the appearance of the city.The characters in the foreground are clustered together in groups to the left, on the quarter deck and on the pier stretching out from the harbour over the greenish water; they are all wearing clothes in keeping with the fashions of the time, each one according to his age and social standing. Notice the splendid young man to the left of the pennant, with the coat-of-arms of the Fratelli Zardinieri, one of the Compagnie della Calza, embroidered on his sleeve.As is the case during traditional and religious celebrations that still take place in Venice today, the streets, bridges, alleyways and steps are crowded with onlookers and many more are shown looking out of the windows; in the background of the painting we can see the caulkers working on a huge ship, dry docked and lying on its side. And the Breton and English cities in the distance are also hives of activity. In the clear air one can almost hear the trumpets and the drums beating at the foot of the tower and on the bastions, the screeching of the halyards against the blocks stretching the sails billowing in the wind and even the scratching of the goosequill on the parchment on which the diligent scribe in the upper right-hand corner is recording the highpoints of the event and the names of the most important protagonists"

15008-tahiti66.jpg	"In December 1897, the sick painter, exhausted by solitude and poverty, tried to commit suicide, which he had been contemplating for a few months. He first mentioned suicide in June 1897. In December, his mind was set. With unbelievable courage, he decided to put the final touch to his work. He painted his declaration of artistic principles, Where Do We Come From? Who Are We? Where Are We Going? he worked at it during the whole month with an incredible fever. After completing the painting he took to the mountains where he swallowed a large dose of arsenic. However, he survived the suicide attempt and life went on and so did his work.In Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?, Gauguin's most ambitious painting in terms of size, number of figures, and probable overlay of meanings, there are Tahitian natives in unusual and probably contrived meditative poses and a foreboding primitive idol. In a way yet to be explained, the painting has to do with human destiny.In a letter of February 1898 to Daniel de Monfreid, Gauguin had written that he had wished to paint a large canvas without the benefit of preparatory sketches, done on rough sackcloth and which had taken him less than a month. After describing the picture at some length, making it clear that the work should be read from the sleeping baby in the bottom right towards the crouching old woman in the lefthand side, he concluded, ""I've finished a philosophical work...I think it very good, if I have the strength to copy it, I shall send it to you.""However, an intricate and detailed preparatory sketch for the whole work exists, throwing the story into doubt. Certainly Gauguin had every reason to try to kill himself; he was very ill and had just learned of the death of his favourite child Aline. It is equally characteristic, however, that he might have attempted to consolidate the myth of artistic martyr that he had been creating steadily both in his painting and in his writing. To leave such a major and complex canvas as a last grand flourish would have virtually guaranteed his posthumous artistic reputation back in Paris"

31946-0poggio.jpg	Pontormo's early success was crowned by the official commissions he received from the Medici court. He took part in the decoration of the Salone of the Medicean Villa of Poggio a Caiano, a country villa at the foot of Montalbano much favoured by Lorenzo il Magnifico. He received the commission from Ottaviano de' Medici and Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, the future Clement VII. Andrea del Sarto and Franciabigio were also included in the project. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.The theme of the lunette fresco by Pontormo is traditionally described as Vertumnus and Pomona, the pictorial representation of the classical myth taken from a story in Ovid's Metamorphosis. This goes back to Vasari, who reported that Pontormo was asked to depict Vertumnus and some figures.However. Vasari's text is not a description of this fresco. Art historians have nevertheless tried to see Vertumnus and Pomona in the figures of the fresco. In the various attempts at interpretation thus far, each of the three male figures has been identified as Vertumnus, and each of the female ones as Pomona. It could be a possible explanation of the subject that the young woman at right in the upper part of the wall wearing a wreath of stalks of grain and various red flowers is Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships. The naked youth on the left can be identified as Liber, the god of fertility (who had been identified with Bacchus since antiquity).The four figures at the lower part of the fresco represent the personifications of the Four Seasons, Winter, Autumn, Summer and Spring.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521.

07962-farnes06.jpg	"The picture shows the ceiling vault of the Galleria Farnese with fictive stucco and Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne, painted by Annibale Carracci.A narrative scene painted on a wall as a framed picture was referred to as a ""quadro riportato,"" which to seventeenth-century thinking suggested that a framed panel painting had been translated into the medium of fresco. If a picture with the perspective of a panel painting is shifted to the ceiling, it is called a ""quadro finto"" (fictitious picture). In such a case the painted architectural framing is replaced by a painted or three-dimensional picture frame; Guido Reni's Aurora in the Casino Pallavicini-Rospiglioso is a clear example of this approach. Here the monumentality of the figures, meant to be seen up close, largely eliminates the picture space, which is only suggested as a horizon. In this Reni was following Annibale Carracci, who for the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese invented a complicated, layered framing system with which to make believable the pictures on and in front of the ceiling. It can be referred to as quadro riportato with respect to the subject matter, but quadro finto owing to the painted stuccowork framing"

06601-adam_eve.jpg	The artist was the son of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. He specialised in flower painting and landscapes, many of which demonstrate a particular emphasis on animals, both domestic and wild. Jan Brueghel was a leading painter of the Antwerp school and held important administrative positions in the artistic hierarchy of the city. He was also appointed court painter to Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella in Brussels in 1609, but he continued to live in Antwerp. Brueghel collaborated with a number of fellow artists such as Joos de Momper, Hendrick van Balen, Pieter Neefs and Hendrick van Steenwyck, but, most importantly, with Rubens, who was a close friend. A portrait by Rubens of Jan Brueghel with his second wife and two children, painted around 1613, is in the Courtauld Institute Galleries (Somerset House, London).Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is a typical example of Jan Brueghel's style. He painted the subject numerous times, in addition to which there are several replicas and copies. The figures of Adam and Eve are placed characteristically to the back of the composition and it is appropriate to the theme that they are almost overwhelmed by their surroundings. Brueghel favoured works on a small scale, brought to a high degree of finish with carefully controlled brushwork, accurate drawing, and vivid colours. It is a highly decorative style, Mannerist in conception and miniaturist in execution.His feeling for landscape was heightened by extensive travel in Italy: Naples in 1590, Rome in 1592-95 and Milan in 1595-96. Later he travelled to Germany, also visiting Prague in 1604 and Spain in 1612. His studies of animals and birds were done from life from those kept in Brussels in the menagerie of the Infanta Isabella, whose interest in animals Rubens shared. His close working relationship with Rubens is evident in the treatment of the horse in the foreground of Adam and Eve. The lion and lioness on the left are derived from the large composition by Rubens of Daniel in the Lion's Den of about 1613 (Washington, National Gallery of Art) which once belonged to Charles I, or from preparatory studies made for this painting (for example, Vienna, Albertina, or London, British Museum).Jan Brueghel often reused his studies of animals: in other versions of the theme of Adam and Eve, such as that in The Hague (Mauritshuis) for which Rubens painted the figures, or that at Budapest; in compositions like the Family of Noah leading the Animals into the Ark, also of 1615 (London, Apsley House), and its variants (Budapest and Earl of Verulam's collection). A version of the present composition - in reverse - is in the Doria Gallery, Rome. By comparison with a replica in the Duke of Northumberland's collection, dated 1613, it is an earlier work

19013-rottamin.jpg	With his domed ceiling fresco in the monastic church of M�nsterschwarzach, Johann Evangelist Holzer supplied the stylistic, compositional and contentual model for G�nther. It was Holzer's pioneering achievement of finding an individual form of expression in a time of stylistic change that forged the link between Rococo and Neoclassicism. At Rott am Inn, G�nther dispenses with Holzer's technique of architectural illusion. The real architecture is no longer continued into the painting, nor does it open up to a celestial illusion. The ceiling painting is like an easel painting projected onto the ceiling, avoiding exaggerated sotto in su views from below.The detail from the overall painting which shows the Holy Trinity in the centre, presents the founders of the Benedictine order on concentrically aligned banks of clouds, with the angles bearing the symbols of his life - chastity, continence, survived assassination attempt (the poisoned chalice alludes to this) and the rules of the order. What is new here, and characteristic of G�nther, is the predominantly grey colouring that replaces the bright colours of Asam and Zimmermann and heralds the advent of Neoclassicism

12516-1jabach.jpg	The central panel of the altarpiece is lost and only the wings survive, depicting the story of Job on the outside panels and four saints on the inside. The triptych was probably commissioned by Frederick the Wise for the church at his Wittenberg Palace to mark the end of the plague in 1503. Most of the painting is by D�rer, although some may have been done by his assistants.The exteriors of the wings tell the story of Job, the upright man who refused to abandon God in the face of grave misfortune. Job's afflictions were the outcome of an argument between God and Satan over whether his faith was strong enough to survive adversity. In D�rer's panels, the body of the elderly Job is covered with boils, which made it a particularly appropriate subject for an altarpiece commissioned to mark the end of the plague. Job sits on a dunghill, in a pose of weary contemplation, and is drenched with slops which his wife pours from a wooden tub. In the upper left corner, Job's house and crops are on fire and the tiny figure of the Devil flees the destruction. The right panel depicts the figures of a piper and a drummer, who bears D�rer's own features. In the distance, behind the drummer, Job's flock of animals has been stolen and is being led away.The insides of the wings (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) depict four saints, set against shimmering gold backgrounds. On the left wing is St Joseph, leaning on a staff, and St Joachim. On the right wing is St Simeon and St Lazarus, with his bishop's crosier and mitre.The altarpiece was later acquired by the Jabach family, who kept it at their family chapel in Cologne until the end of the eighteenth century. The wings were then sawn apart to separate the two sets of paintings. The exteriors, with the story of Job, were later reduced in size at the top and along the edges where they originally met. The panels are now dispersed and are unfortunately divided between three German museums. Because the central panel is lost and its subject-matter is unknown, it is more difficult to determine the significance of the wings

16133-chris09.jpg	This scene is composed with the heightened effect of the gaze and gesture of Christ in mind. The rhythm of the individual gestures and the reactions of those present clearly show the energy which emanates from Christ, which startles the onlookers and wakes Lazarus from the dead. This energy carries on like an arrested wave into the narrative details: the arrangement of the folds in Lazarus' winding sheet or in the hitched up cloak of the disciple next to him are touched by it, as are the precisely characterized faces.Giotto (or a pupil of Giotto) painted this scene again in the Magdalen Chapel of the Lower Church of San Frencesco at Assisi in a larger version, using the same figures with similar attitudes

44372-riding.jpg	Wouwerman was a Dutch painter of landscapes with battle and hunting scenes and genre scenes of soldiers in camp reminiscent of Pieter van Laer. He frequently disposed dozens of small figures in his canvases and he had a special fondness for white horses. There are about 1200 recorded paintings by him, only very few dated. His brothers Jan and Pieter were also landscape painters, Pieter imitated Philips and used a confusingly similar PW monogram.The picture shown here depicts a scene of horse training with a mountainous landscape in the background.A company of horse trainers are seen in a woodland glade in the mountains breaking in horses. In this composition the figures of the riders, grooms and children, all clothed in bright colour, are no more important than the horses. The trees, billowing cumulus clouds and rather misty landscape suggest a more southerly setting than the place where this picture was in fact painted. The prancing movements of the saddled horses make this an exceptionally animated composition

31105-2proce11.jpg	To the right we see the Queen of Sheba's encounter with Solomon, which takes place in a temple-like structure. Solomon stands with his courtiers; the queen, entering from the right, deferentially bows to him. The queen prophesied to Solomon that the dominion of the Jews would one day be destroyed by the man who would hang from that beam. Solomon's response was to have the beam sunk in a well.This famous scene takes place within an architectural structure, enlivened by decorations of coloured marble. Everything seems created according to architectural principles: even the three ladies standing behind the Queen are placed so as to form a sort of open church apse behind her. There is a real sense of spatial depth between the characters witnessing the event; and their heads, one behind the other, are placed on different planes. This distinction of spatial spaces is emphasized also by the different colour tonalities, with which Piero has by this stage in his career entirely replaced his technique of outlining the shapes used in previous frescoes.There is an overall feeling of solemn rituality, rather like a lay ceremony: from Solomon's priestly gravity to the ladies aristocratic dignity. Each figure, thanks to the slightly lowered viewpoint, becomes more imposing and graceful; Piero even succeeds in making the characteristic figure of the fat courtier on the left, dressed in red, looks dignified.

06259-03eleono.jpg	By about 1540 Bronzino had undoubtedly become the darling of the Medici court and Florentine aristocracy, not least thanks to his literary talents, for he was also poet. He alternated his production of smooth, almost crystalline portraits, with noteworthy decorative schemes, such as the frescos in the Medici villas, the redecoration of the private apartments in the Palazzo Vecchio or designing tapestries for the Grand Duke. From 1560 onward, he produced more religious paintings for altars in the major Florentine churches. These reveal his limits as a painter.This altarpiece was executed for the Chapel of Eleonora in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. The chapel is located on the second floor of the palace and it served as the private chapel of the duchess, Eleonora of Toledo, daughter of the Viceroy of Naples, and wife of Cosimo I de' Medici. The painting occupied the end wall of the small chapel flanked by St John the Baptist and St Cosmas.The painting was finished in 1545 and was sent in the same year to Besan�on to the private secretary of Emperor Charles V with whom Cosimo had important negotiations. Since 1553 a replica by Bronzino replaces the altarpiece. Later the two side panels were also replaced by the figures of an Annunciation

07669-carlev13.jpg	The View of a River Port is a fine example of Carlevaris's imaginary landscapes, painted shortly after his return to Venice from Rome and therefore datable to the first years of the eighteenth century. The painter has here assembled architectural motifs gathered from various places in the papal city. The arched bridge could be one of those over the Tiber, perhaps the Ponte Rotto, the equestrian monument is based on Bernini's Constantine and the houses in the background are a partial view of the Isola Tiberina. Although Carlevarijs was not interested in the precise representation of reality in this work as he was in his subsequent Venetian views, but rather assembled elements from life in an imaginary whole, the elements typical of his mature work are already evident, particularly in the central section with the quay flooded in sunlight and the lively characters painted in bright colours.This painting is a lovely composition that shows the essential traits of the artist's training, with a northern Baroque fondness for ruins and a central Italian form of scenographic landscape

30302-capriccr.jpg	Pannini's mature manner, culminating in his easel works of the 1730s and 1740s, developed through an assimilation of a variety of influences, most notably his exposure to the work of Gaspare Vanvitelli, another master of Roman vedute, and Salvator Rosa. The present painting is a excellent example of how Pannini incorporated all these different influences and interpreted them in his own unique and impressive fashion.This capriccio of classical ruins includes the Temple of Antonius and Faustina, the Colosseum, the Basilica of Maxentius and the Temple of Venus and Rome.

32178-margheri.jpg	Vincenzo Gonzaga (1562-1612) was ruler of the Duchy of Mantua and the Duchy of Montferrat from 1587 to 1612. He took an interest in Flanders and visited the region frequently. In Brussels in 1599, Vincenzo met the painter Frans Pourbus the younger, a courtly and sophisticated portraitist in the service of the archduke Albrecht Habsburg. He convinced Pourbus to fill the vacant court portraitist position in Mantua.A specialist in dynastic portraits was an absolute necessity in any princely court at that time. This artist was not only obliged to record the likenesses of the local ruler and his family, but he also had to exalt the political roles of his subjects by the use of sophisticated, emblematic details in the pictures. Flemish painters had for some time been recognized as the great masters of this genre, adept at acute observation and the painstaking recording of details. The application of these skills did not necessarily result in a perfectly accurate rendering of the face, but focused rather on an analytical description of beautifully embroidered clothing, lace collars, brilliant military medals, and the precious stones in the jewelry.Pourbus made a number of these portraits in Mantua in 1604-05, including the full-length portrait of Margherita Gonzaga. In this portrait the serious and composed figure poses in a rich, luxurious setting

18048-01scene.jpg	The first scene, The School of Tagaste, relates to his Confessions. This, probably his best-known work, was written between 397 and 401. The picture shows him starting school at the elementary school of Tagaste. The teacher walking towards the young Augustine is greeting him by gently caressing his face. Within the family group his mother, St Monica, is highlighted by means of a golden halo which obeys the laws of perspective. In the simultaneous scene on the right the teacher is punishing a pupil while the little Augustine is attentively studying a school slate with Greek letters on it.From the scale of the buildings and figures it can be seen how far the pictorial space extends backwards. In this way Benozzo creates a counterweight to the arrangement of the figures parallel to the picture in the foreground.Particularly characteristic of this cycle is the city view with buildings in the style of the Early Renaissance, including depictions of some that really exist.The inscription tells us that Augustine made considerable advances within a short space of time in the Latin school of Tagaste, and emphasizes the Latin element that dominated his education

27060-maurits.jpg	In the first decades of the 17th century we find centres of portraiture at Delft and The Hague where at various times the stadhouder had his court, the States-General its seat, and most foreign diplomats resided. Michiel Jansz. van Miereveld and his pupil Jan Anthonisz van Ravensteyn (c. 1572-1657) are the outstanding names. Both artists inspired a host of minor painters. Their portraits are restrained, rather dry visual reports, competent in draughtsmanship and with only a moderate decorative effect. Costumes, armour, and faces are rendered with the same meticulous care and reliability. Miereveld was, it seems, prepared to make some adjustments in the features of a countenance to satisfy a foreign client. Miereveld enjoyed a greater reputation - particularly among court circles in The Hague - and he kept a workshop busy making portraits of members of the house of Orange-Nassau and other noble families.Maurits is represented in the gilded suit of armour the States-General had given him for his military victory at Nieuwpoort in 1600. The portrait thus makes claims for the Stadhouder's indispensability to the States-General and the Republic. Van Miereveld's studio produced numerous paintings of the prince

06256-00eleono.jpg	This view shows the altarpiece and the frescoes in the Chapel of Eleonora da Toledo in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence.In 1540, soon after marrying Eleonora of Toledo, Cosimo de' Medici moved from the Palazzo Medici into the Palazzo della Signoria, publicly proclaiming his dominance over all civic institutions. Cosimo remodeled the building to accommodate his expanding family and commissioned elaborate decorative programs of the histories of his ancestors, of his own military conquests, and of dynastic portraiture to fill its vast spaces. On the upper floor Cosimo constructed a small cubical chapel for Eleanor's private devotions, completely decorated by Bronzino with imagery that ostensibly referred to Christian redemption but which barely veiled his dynastic and political intentions. The wall frescoes all depict scenes from the life of Moses: the left-wall frescoes include the Miracle of the Spring (Moses Striking the Rock) and the Gathering of Manna, the right wall is covered by the fresco Crossing of the Red Sea, an uncommon subject in Christian chapels. The altarpiece currently in the chapel, depicting the Lamentation, is a replica Bronzino made in 1553 of his 1545 original (which was sent to France as a diplomatic gift and is now in the Mus�e des Beaux-Arts, Besan�on). Bronzino also removed the original flanking panels of St John the Baptist and St Cosmas and replaced them with side panels depicting the Annunciation. The frescoes of the vault represents Sts Michael, John the Evangelist, Jerome and Francis. For the decoration of the chapel Bronzino applied an unusual technique: the underpainting was true fresco and the finished layer in tempera. The combination of complex figural compositions, rich colours, and elaborate decorative motifs within the chapel's small space create a bejewelled effect typical of Mannerism as practiced at the court of Cosimo and Eleonora. The style employed by Bronzino in the chapel frescoes resembles the cool, calculated manner which can be seen in his portraits

33467-02mythol.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 464.The young Rembrandt was influenced by his teacher Pieter Lastman. As a history painter Rembrandt concentrated mainly on biblical stories, but, inspired by his teacher, he portrayed in this picture a story from Ovid's Metamorphoses: the abduction of the princess Europa.Among the early works by Rembrandt, two mythological scenes, the Abduction of Europa, and the Diana Bathing, take place on richly wooded riverbanks. Both are scenes of divine intervention on earth. In the first the god Zeus abducts Princess Europa, and in the other the goddess Diana turns the unfortunate hunter Actaeon into a stag who is then devoured by his own dogs. The settings for the compositions are quite similar: a shoreline curves from  the right foreground into the left middle ground; above it is an opening into a background that is blocked  at the back. The largest elements in the compositions are massive, looming trees. This compositional scheme derives fromformulas that had been worked out by Flemish artists in the preceding decades. It was employed in a contemporaneous painting by Alexander Keirinckx, who moved in 1628 from Antwerp to Utrecht and is recoreded in Amsterdam in the mid-1630s

07604-61alof.jpg	Only very recently was this painting identified in the gallery's storeroom, and related to a reference in Bellori's book of 1672. The attribution to Caravaggio has found almost universal acceptance among Caravaggio scholars, even if the identity of the sitter is still disputed. Originally the portrait was considered to show Alof de Wignacourt, the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta, the sitter is today generally identified with the Maltese knight Antonio Martelli. Martelli was a a Florentine who had joined the Order in as early as 1558 and took part in the heroic defence of Malta against the Turks in 1565. The portrait was painted during Caravaggio's sojourn in Malta.The sitter playfully rests his left hand on his sword in its sheath, whilst in his right hand he is holding a rosary. The artist subtly dramatizes the contradiction between piety and brutality by the lighting and the fact that his subject is averting his eyes from the viewer

43138-ferry_bo.jpg	Victors has painted here a typical scene of rural life in a riverside village. The ferryboat carries a peasant and his cattle, so that the huge bulk of a cow stands uneasily in such a small and lightweight craft. The indifferent attitude of the peasant, who leans on the cow, sheep surrounding his feet, indicates that this trip is an everyday necessity. In another boat on the left-hand side a boy teases the ducks in the water's shallows, much to the amusement of his companion. The painting contrasts the peasants with the horseman on the right-hand side. This man, probably a soldier, is fashionably dressed and groomed, and his horse looks strong and sleek. The peasants, in comparison, wear grubby and worn clothing and the cow looks thin and slightly ungainly.

14177-072game.jpg	"This painting is a pendant of A Game of Horse and Rider. The pendants were meant to be installed in boiseries as part of a larger decorative program. They are equal in size and have similar colour schemes and compositions, and their subjects are complementary; each focuses on richly verdant gardens in which groups of figures have gathered to enjoy games in the outdoors.The two games depicted in the pendants were common in Fragonard's time. Hot Cockles (""la main chaude"") is a game in which sleight of hand and close attention are rewarded. One player, the ""penitent,"" hides his face in the lap of a second (called the ""confessor,"" a referee who monitors the game) and places his hand flat behind his back. In turn, other players slap the penitent on the hand, and he tries to identify who hit him. The player who lets himself be discovered becomes the penitent.The game is played by elegantly dressed young adults in a formal garden, with clipped hedges, smooth parterres, potted trees, and discreetly placed sculptures.The pendants owe a debt to Oudry, whose designs for a tapestry cycle on the theme of ""Amusements champ&#234;tres"" include representations of Horse and Rider and Hot Cockles that are closely related to Fragonard's compositions"

07007-herodia.jpg	This painting is one of the best inventions of the painter's early years, still marked chiefly by the expressive tension of the Lombard figurative culture of the turn of the century, and particularly of the models of Cerano and Morazzone.While the image of Salome alone with John the Baptist's head is quite common in Renaissance painting, the portrayal of Herodias in the same scenario is far rarer. Nevertheless, the theme was one of Cairo's favourites and in his early years he replicated it at least four times. As is the case in the other versions, in the Vicenza canvas the painter offers a very singular interpretation of the scene, characterized by the portrayal of Herodias swooning. Her hand is outstretched towards the saint's severed head, which is in turn distinguished by the surprising motif of his tongue pierced by a needle

05526-30birth.jpg	"The title of the Birth of Venus can be traced back to the 16th century. What is depicted is not, however, the moment of the goddess' birth - the classical poet Hesiod describes her as rising from the foaming sea after Chronos cut off his father Uranus' penis and threw it into the ocean. Instead, we see the moment when she comes ashore. Inspired by classical tradition, Botticelli's contemporary Angelo Poliziano described this scene in his epic poem ""Stanze per la Giostra"", thereby providing what was probably the most important source of inspiration for the painting. He described Venus as being driven towards the shore on a shell by Zephyr; and how an onlooker would have seen the flash in the goddess' eye and the Horae of the seasons standing on the shore in white garments, their flowing hair caressed by the wind.The god of the winds, Zephyr, and the breeze Aura are in a tight embrace, and are gently driving Venus towards the shore with their breath. She is standing naked on a golden shining shell, which reaches the shore floating on rippling waves. There, a Hora of Spring is approaching on the tips of her toes, in a graceful dancing motion, spreading out a magnificent cloak for her. Venus rises with her marble-coloured carnations above the ocean next to her, like a statue. Her hair, which is playfully fluttering around her face in the wind, is given a particularly fine sheen by the use of fine golden strokes. The unapproachable gaze under the heavy lids gives the goddess an air of cool distance. The rose is supposed to have flowered for the first time when Venus was born. For that reason, gentle rose-coloured flowers are blowing around Zephyr and Aura in the wind.The goddess of love, one of the first non-biblical female nudes in Italian art, is depicted in accordance with the classical Venus pudica. She is, however, as little a precise copy of her prototype as the painting is an exact illustration of Poliziano's poetry. The group comprising Venus and the Hora of spring demonstrates Botticelli's flexible use of Christian means of depiction. It is uncertain who commissioned the painting. In the first half of the 16th century, it was kept in the Castello villa, owned by the descendants of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici. However, it was never mentioned in inventories of his property. It is, though, extremely likely that the Birth of Venus was commissioned for a country seat. In contrast to the Primavera, the painting is painted on canvas. This was a medium normally chosen for paintings that were destined to decorate country houses, for canvas was less expensive and easier to transport than wooden panels"

40295-101turne.jpg	Turner's early picture, Morning amongst the Coniston Fells, the result of a tour in the north of England in 1797, shows an original awareness of the drama of nature with its subtle play of early sunlight and dispersing mist. There is no overt religiosity, as in Friedrich's cross, but Turner also chose the upright format associated with the altarpiece, and added further significance by quoting verses alongside his picture in the Academy catalogue.

21953-0monalis.jpg	According to Vasari, this picture is a portrait of Mona or Monna (short for Madonna) Lisa, who was born in Florence in 1479 and in 1495 married the Marquese del Giocondo, a Florentine of some standing - hence the painting's other name, `La Gioconda'. This identification, however, has sometimes been questioned.Leonardo took the picture with him from Florence to Milan, and later to France. It must have been this portrait which was seen at Cloux, near Amboise, on 10 October 1517 by the Cardinal of Aragon and his secretary, Antonio de Beatis. There is a slight difficulty here, however, because Beatis says that the portrait had been painted at the wish of Giuliano de Medici. Historians have attempted to solve this problem by suggesting that Monna del Giocondo had been Giuliano's mistress.The painting was probably acquired by Fran�ois I from Leonardo himself, or after his death from his executor Melzi. It is recorded as being at Fontainebleau by Vasari (1550), Lomazzo (1590), Peiresc, and Cassiano del Pozzo (1625). The latter relates that when the Duke of Buckingham came to the French court to seek the hand of Henrietta of France for Charles I, he made it known that the King was most anxious to own this painting; but the courtiers of Louis XIII prevented him from parting with the picture. It was put on exhibition in the Mus�e Napol�on in I8o4; before that, in 1800, Bonaparte had it in his room in the Tuileries.From the beginning it was greatly admired and much copied, and it came to be considered the prototype of the Renaissance portrait. It became even more famous in 1911, when it was stolen from the Salle Carr�e on 21 August 1911 by Vicenzo Perrugia, an Italian workman. In 1913 it was found in Florence, exhibited at the Uffizi, then in Rome and Milan, and brought back to Paris on 31 December in the same year.This figure of a woman, dressed in the Florentine fashion of her day and seated in a visionary, mountainous landscape, is a remarkable instance of Leonardo's sfumato technique of soft, heavily shaded modeling. The Mona Lisa's enigmatic expression, which seems both alluring and aloof, has given the portrait universal fame. Reams have been written about this small masterpiece by Leonardo, and the gentle woman who is its subject has been adapted in turn as an aesthetic, philosophical and advertising symbol, entering eventually into the irreverent parodies of the Dada and Surrealist artists.Vasari relates that Leonardo worked on it for four years without being able to finish it; yet the picture gives the impression of being completely realized. The dates suggested for it vary between 1503 and 1513, the most widely accepted being 1503-05.Taking a living model as his point of departure, Leonardo has expressed in an ideal form the concept of balanced and integrated humanity. The smile stands for the movement of life, and the mystery of the soul. The misty blue mountains, towering above the plain and its river, symbolize the universe

10711-vesuvius.jpg	In 1820, Dahl made an Italian journey. Staying only briefly in Rome, where the weight of tradition oppressed him, he concentrated on Naples, where the natural scene revealed itself to him in all its multifarity of form and abundance of light. Dahl became completely engrossed in a study of colour nuances and effects of illumination. He had little contact with the German artists working in Italy, meeting frequently only Franz Catel, who may have introduced him to Turner's watercolour landscapes, which were exhibited in Rome in 1819.Dahl looked upon the fresh, spontaneous studies he made in the environs of Naples solely as preliminary works for subsequent oils. When Mt. Vesuvius erupted in December 1820, he was among the first to climb the volcano in order to see and depict the phenomenon at first hand. The Oslo painting goes back to this experience. Already in the eighteenth century, depictions of Vesuvius erupting were among the most popular subjects of pictorial reportage, intended not only to satisfy a public thirst for sensations but to embody the aesthetic ideals of the sublime and the picturesque

34971-2mustair3.jpg	The best preserved Carolingian fresco cycle can be found in a remote valley in Graub�nden, in the monastery church of M�stair. The church is dedicated to St John the Baptist, and it is generally believed to have been founded by in about 790, and probably by Charlemagne. One can assume that the frescoes were painted soon after the completion of the monastery church. Located in the apses, the paintings remained undiscovered until 1896 and were finally completely uncovered by 1950. Parts of the frescoes had been painted over in the twelfth century by artists belonging to the School of Salzburg.The walls of the aisles and the apses are decorated with numerous frescoes depicting subjects from the Old and New Testaments, with architectural shapes that decorate the background in an unobtrusive manner.The artists who executed the paintings did not belong to Charlemagne's court school. Extensive commissions were taken on by itinerant artists who came from Italy and were trained in Byzantine style. The Byzantine influence can be found not only in the shapes but also in the treatment of the pictorial narrative, that is the manner in which the individual scenes are emphasized by the articulation of the architectural elements around them.The picture shows the scene Christ Healing the Mute Man on the north wall

The eleven panels fill the walls of a room illuminated by two windows, one on the east end and one on the west. The room takes up the third floor of the Eagle's Tower (Torre Aquila), at one time part of Trent's defences. The dimension of the room is 6 x 5,8 m. The height of the frescoes is 3 m, the draped fabric painted below replaces the original wainscoting, which was painted with a sequence of niches.The pictures of the months in the Eagle's Tower constitute the only such cycle to survive from the early fifteenth century. The scenes have much in common with the sorts of pictures found in Gobelins and in miniature painting. One of the sources for the depictions of everyday life presented in the cycle was a medical textbook, the Tacuinum sanitatis.Under Georg von Liechtenstein (1360-1419), who was the bishop and temporal ruler of the diocese of Trent between 1390 until his death, the Eagle's Tower, along with the smaller Falcon's Tower, was incorporated into the episcopal palace, the Castel Vecchio. They were connected to the palace by the parapet walks of the city wall, at that time unroofed. (The Castle of Trent was depicted in 1497 by a D�rer's watercolour.)In the 16th century and later the frescoes were restored and the room decoration was altered. The installation of a wooden spiral stair connecting the three upper floors of tower destroyed the scene of March.The picture shows the east wall in the Eagle's Tower with the representations of January and February. To the right, where the lost March once stood is the wood paneling that enclosed a spiral staircase; on the left above the entrance is December.Given the climate of South Tirol, it is appropriate that the January scene presents a snow-covered landscape, in the foreground of which a group of six courtiers is engaged in a snowball fight. The imposing structure in the background is the castle Stenico, near Trent, which Georg von Liechtenstein had restored. The February scene depicts a tournament and a row of spectators, and in the narrow space remaining to the right of the window it includes a vignette of a blacksmith in his workshop

17239-6still2.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 678, JH 1977.In his last weeks at Saint-R�my before he moved north again, van Gogh painted a series of still-lifes. The size and scale of these recall the monumental paintings of sunflowers of the summer of 1888, but the disciplined use of complementary colours also establishes a link with the experiments in colour and in flower painting which absorbed him in his first year in Paris, 1886. In Saint-R�my he painted pink roses against a green ground, and here, violet irises against a yellow field. The painting betrays a renewed liveliness and intensity of colour. Instead of toning down the contrasts in order to harmonize the different parts of the painting, as he sometimes did, van Gogh has tried here, as he had done in Paris, to sharpen and heighten them. Van Gogh has painted these flowers on what was his preferred size of canvas in late 1888-90. The regular use of the same size of canvas meant that if and when his paintings were exhibited they would work together as a series
