42399-gouden_l.jpg	Seventeenth-century pictures defined the Dutch scene not only in terms of shared history but also as a site of productivity. While landscapes, city scenes, and animal paintings advertised the ingenious foundations of Dutch economic success, other genres - marine painting foremost - acknowledged its more significant basis in overseas trade and colonial ventures. Although many seascapes were available cheaply, the best marine painters were among the most highly rewarded artists. The States-General, city governments, and trading companies commissioned views of the Dutch naval and trading fleets, before a prosperous harbour, in battle, or at sea. The marine specialist Willem van de Velde II painted the heroic vessel Gouden Leeuw in the bustle of Amsterdam harbour

05983-gethsema.jpg	Today he is considered a minor painter, but in his time Brandi was regarded as a master, certainly on the level of such artists as Pier Francesco Mola, Giro Ferri, and Carlo Maratta. In 1650 he emerged as the direct heir of Giovanni Lanfranco, with whom he had studied. Brandi gained a reputation as an artist who was able to bring together the classicist style with baroque figurative inventions and above all the light of Caravaggio, something he was aware of through the paintings of Mattia Preti. In fact, Brandi's style is marked by the potent effect of colours amid shadows, colour that in some cases was all too strong.The Christ in the Garden is characterized by an atmosphere of great intimacy. The pyramidal grouping of Christ comforted by two angels emerges as it were from a dense bank of clouds, which appear indeed to be invading the scene from the left. This type of dynamism coming out of the background is a typical baroque expression.

35667-trinity.jpg	Rublyov is regarded as the greatest Russian icon-painter of all, and his icon of the Holy Trinity, painted for the Sergey-Trinity monastery, is the most famous of all Russian icons. This icon is a masterpiece of ancient Russian iconography, and the Church established it as the model for depicting the Trinity.In Rublyov's icon, the persons of the Holy Trinity are shown in the order in which they are confessed in the Credo. The first angel is the first person of the Trinity - God the Father; the second, middle angel is God the Son; the third angel is God the Holy Spirit. All three angels are blessing the chalice, in which lies a sacrificed calf, prepared for eating.

38689-theorbo.jpg	Several versions are known of the aristocratic interior by the artist.Many artists have painted beautiful satins and silks, but no one has ever depicted satin more exquisitely than the much-travelled Dutchman Gerard Terborch. First trained by his father Gerard Terborch the Elder, who had lived in Italy in his youth, the precocious young painter worked in Amsterdam and Haarlem before venturing to Germany, Italy, England, France and Spain. In 1646 he went to M�nster, where he witnessed the ratification of the treaty of 1648 signaling the triumphant end of the Dutch wars of independence from Spain. In 1654, he married and settled down, permanently, in Deventer.Whether miniature full-length portraits, or scenes of - supposedly - everyday life, Terborch's pictures are distinguished by technical and psychological refinement. It seems curious, therefore, that he first specialised in guardroom subjects - although he brings even to the rowdy theme of garrisoned soldiers an element of stillness and reflection. His best-known paintings, however, represent elegant interiors with only a few figures, one of them usually a young woman in ravishing pale satin. Here, in an old-ivory bodice trimmed with fur and a white skirt setting off her fair hair, her shoe propped against a foot warmer, she plays the theorbo, an early form of lute, accompanying the man holding a song book. A man in a cloak looks on, and a spaniel seems to listen. Behind them is a curtained bed. Under the red Turkey carpet covering the table lies a single playing card, the ill-omened ace of spades.The woman and the singing man each appear in other paintings by the artist, as do the silver box and candlestick - this is 'selective' naturalism, a scene composed from the imagination with ingredients assembled from drawings and studio props. In Dutch paintings of this type music-making is usually suggestive of love, while playing cards may be emblems of improvidence, and dogs and footwarmers can signify base desires. Yet it would be foolhardy to read this subtle painting, with its subdued tonality, as a scene of the demi-monde. We can never know what the relationships of these three figures are, and their thoughts and feelings, so delicately implied, are infinitely ambiguous. That, surely, was the artist's intention: to evoke imperfectly understood events, tantalising in their suggestion of mutability and transience.

25911-stimelo.jpg	"Like the apple in the works of Baschenis and C�zanne, the melon - in numerous varieties - is a leitmotif that ""rolls"" through Mel�ndez's still-lifes. One of the painter's most sophisticated compositions is Still-Life with Cantaloup Melon, in which he proves himself a fanatic when it comes to rounded forms. He devotes himself to natural produce and man-made items with equal enthusiasm, piling them one behind or on top of the other and thereby filling the pictorial space. Plates, a white cloth, bread and a knife rise above the top of the woven basket into which they have been packed. The objects are painted in close-up and brought right to the front edge of the table, so that the melon curves forward into the space occupied by the viewer. The different surfaces are perfectly imitated and the painting of the melon skin, with its strikingly reticular texture, is astounding. Some objects reflect the light while others absorb it; light assumes the function of a sculptural material.

03968-bello108.jpg	Turin is seen here from an unusual vantage point. The spectator is situated somewhere on the ramparts of one of the lunettes near the royal palace and looks toward the west, obliquely along the moat which was part of the fortifications. This lunette is surrounded by earthworks, enclosing an area we see as the flat meadow on the right. The palace garden is situated on the bastion to the left of the moat, with the tower called 'il Garritone' on the left in the corner. Behind the main building of the palace, which is shaded, rises the opulent dome of the chapel of San Sidone; and the tower of the Cathedral soars above its western wing. The old city with its multitude of towers is visible beyond the palace complex to the right, while further into the distance we see the Alps, their tallest peaks capped with snow.The scene is full of human activity. Scaffolding has been erected against the retaining wall for the masons who are repairing it and who have their mortar pit and their supply of bricks in the meadow on the opposite side of the moat. The farmer's cart has apparently brought material. We also see women doing their washing. A dignified and elegantly dressed gentleman - a courtier or perhaps the King himself - draws his companion's attention to the restoration work in progress.Both in its breadth and depth the scene is divided in two by the flat, brightly lit wing of the palace, which runs parallel to the image surface. The two parts are connected by the moat which is seen in a strong perspective. Bellotto apparently borrowed this unrelenting diagonal, which leads the eye of the beholder into the depth, from his teacher Canaletto.The painter had to bring a good deal of ingenuity to bear on this composition, given that it was not possible to see this view from one vantage point. From a viewpoint directly opposite the rampart of the fortification Bellotto could see the Garritone to his left, but he almost certainly drew the view of the palace itself, sitting in or near this tower. Furthermore he 'straightened' the fa�ade of the western wing. There is another curious feature of the three-dimensionality evoked in this work. On the one hand the strong linear perspective induces our eye to jump some tens of kilometres towards the Alps, on the other, all the buildings, even far away into the distance, have been represented with equal sharpness, as if by the zoom-lens of a camera. This effect is present in all panorama paintings by Bellotto. It could be explained by a need to convey a maximum of topographical information and precision. It is not known whether Bellotto made individual detailed sketches of the remoter buildings on the spot, or whether he studied them with the aid of a telescope-like optical instrument.The painting has a pendant which represents the old bridge over the Po in Turin (also in Galleria Sabauda, Turin). Both canvases were commissioned by Carlo Emmanuele III, King of Sardinia and Duke of Savoy. They were Bellotto's first royal commissions, and he accordingly signed them both with his name and surname

43707-confisca.jpg	Ferdinand Waldm�ller was the most important Austrian painter of the first half of the 19th century, and the leading representative of the Biedermeier style which emerged in Austria and Germany between 1815 (the year of the Congress of Vienna) and the Revolution of 1848. For Waldm�ller and the Biedermeier circle, art's only purpose was the study of nature from an objective point of view, a conviction which led him to reject any idealizing or Romantic tendency. In addition to landscapes Waldm�ller also painted other subjects, all with an equally realistic approach, such as still-lifes, portraits and scenes of everyday life and customs

05256-12thorns.jpg	Bosch's interpretation of the Passion scenes must have appealed to his contemporaries, for he reworked the London composition (Mocking of Christ) into a second version of the subject. Although the original painting is lost, it survives in no less than seven copies, a testimony to its popularity. This second composition, in turn, seems to have inspired the large, imposing Christ Crowned with Thorns in the Escorial, in which the figures have been adjusted to a circular field and placed against a gold ground.Christ sits on a ledge in the immediate foreground, and, as before, his eyes engage the viewer. This time, however, his furrowed brow clearly expresses his suffering, and the static gestures of his captors in the earlier versions have been transformed into violent actions. A snarling rat-faced man rips off Christ's robe with a mailed fist; his smirking companion has placed one foot on the ledge in order to push the crown of thorns more tightly on his head, while a third man watches intently from behind the other two. In contrast, the two spectators on the left look on with cool detachment. This torment of Christ is given cosmic meaning in the grisaille border, where angels and devils are locked in unending conflict

38726-poggio1.jpg	Of all the Medici villas in the environs of Florence, Poggio Imperiale has the most imposing site and is also closest to the Palazzo Pitti, which became the official residence of the grand dukes in 1561. The property came into the possession of Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565. From 1618 Maria Magdalena of Austria, the wife of Cosimo II de' Medici invested  a great sum on improvements made under the direction of Giulio Parigi. In 1624 the property was officially named Poggio Imperiale with reference to the grand duchess's imperial lineage. The lineage was also featured in the ambitious pictorial program of the public rooms and bedrooms which lay on the ground floor. However, the villa was stripped of its precious furnishings and art treasures from the seventeenth century under the Habsburg-Lorraine regency (1737-65).The decoration of Poggio Imperiale started again under the reign of Peter Leopold (1747-1792) who succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Tuscany when his eldest brother became emperor as Joseph II in 1765. This decoration was intended to set a new artistic direction and propagate new standards of taste: Neoclassicism.Three rooms in the south wing were frescoed in 1768-72 by Tommaso Gherardini and Giuliano Traballesi with the collaboration of Giuseppe del Moro, one of the best Tuscan perspective painters of the time. It was followed by the decoration of five rooms in the west wing in 1773-78. Here the frescoes were executed by Giuseppe Maria Terreni, Giuseppe Gricci, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini, and Tommaso Gherardini.The Sala delle Opere e dei Giorni is one of the grand duke's official rooms in the west wing. It received its name due to the assumption that its decoration by Giuseppe Maria Terreni refers to Hesiod's didactic poem Works and Days. The ceiling picture shows Hercules Crowned by Gloria and Honor, the wall pictures are landscapes, shepherd idylls in classical ruins, and a nobleman with retinue in front of a tavern.Images showing the decorations of the various rooms in the Villa Poggio Imperiale can be viewd on the respective pages of Tommaso Gherardini, Giuliano Traballesi, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Maria Terreni, and Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini

18011-20middle.jpg	The middle king, accompanied by his pages and squires, is gazing upwards while riding through a hilly Tuscan landscape. He may be gazing at the Star of Bethlehem, which was possibly located in the left part of the destroyed entrance wall. The king is considered to be a portrait of Emperor John VII Paleologus. The identification is based on the assumption that the depictions reflect contemporary events. In this case it is thought to be a reference to the Council of Ferrara-Florence, in which the Emperor took part in 1439.The grouping of the figures, costumes and head types used in the painting of the Medici Chapel are closely derived from the panel painting from 1423 by Gentile da Fabriano which is now in the Uffizi in Florence. A close examination reveals that models exist in Gentile's famous work for both the apparently very portrait-like features and for the headdresses and crowns. For example, this is true of both the youngest and middle kings. The panel painting was commissioned by the political rivals of the Medicis; the Palla Strozzi family, and it prompted an attempt to take them on in the field of art. The result was the wall paintings in the Medici Chapel, which display a fairytale splendour: garments set with pearls, brocade materials, satin and silk, dresses with gold thread, gem-studded belts and lavishly decorated bridles

24855-altar_r.jpg	The right shutter of the Moulins Triptych represents Anne de France, the wife of Pierre de Bourbon.In the pomp and luxury of her clothes the donor's wife is no whit behind the magnificence of her husband. Apart from the cloak, held together across her breast by a double cord, which at the time was already going out of mode, she is dressed in the height of fashion. Her glittering coronet, surmounting a pearl-embroidered head-dress, indicates her double rank as wife of a duke and daughter of the reigning monarch, Louis XI. Her somewhat reserved or even haughty expression may indeed be due to her consciousness of her position. Her daughter, a replica of her mother in features, attitude, and very nearly in dress, kneels behind her. In the almost physical pleasure the painter has taken in rendering the texture and feel of the fine fabrics we are aware of the direct influence of Flemish art

10921-nativit.jpg	Gerard David provided a link between the late Gothic art of the earlier Netherlandish masters and the new Renaissance style; in his works we see a felicitous combination of the vigour characteristic of the northern masters and the brilliant technique and feeling for form seen in the work of those of the southern provinces. He painted mostly altarpieces, Madonnas and saints, striving to make the figures lifelike and including many natural, intimate details. In the Nativity the shepherds, ungainly in their clumsy boots, look as if they scarcely dare to approach the Infant (the figure in the background opening is usually believed to be a self-portrait) and the streets and houses of the town in the background are depicted with the detailed clarity of a topographer.

22760-cleopatr.jpg	Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, committed suicide to avoid being taken prisoner by Octavius, who had conquered Anthony, Cleopatra's lover and Octavius' rival for supremacy in Rome. Plutarch reports that the Queen wished to die by a serpent's bite, for the ancient Egyptians believed that this death ensured immortality.The artist has not chosen to portray the dramatic climax, nor the decision to commit suicide, nor even the snake bite itself, but the moment in which the tension begins to subside. The serpent has done its deadly work, and the young black servant boy holding the basket of flowers is staring with terror-struck eyes at the snake in it, while a servant woman supports her swooning mistress. On the surface of things, very little seems to be happening in this picture, with everything concentrated on the transition between life and death. All the light falls on the young Queen, bathing her body in warm and sensuous colours. All of life itself seems to be concentrated in the colour of her flesh on the threshold of death, whose advent is suggested by her sinking arm and overcast gaze. The central moment in this painting is one of transition, and this is reflected in the move from light to darkness and in the strong graduation of colours from the background to the foreground.

04766-capricci.jpg	Jan Frans van Bloemen, called l'Orizzonte was drawn to the beauty of Rome and the surrounding campagna and inspired by the classicising landscape paintings of the Italian master Gaspard Dughet. His grounding in the Flemish landscape tradition enabled him to easily assimilate the analytical and picturesque realism of Dughet and he quickly became known as one of the finest classical landscape painters in Rome during the first half of the eighteenth century.The present canvas shows a capriccio view of Rome with figures resting in the foreground. Three women are engaged washing clothing at a picturesque fountain set in a secluded grove on the outskirts of the city.

40017-3bed3.jpg	Towards the end of 1892 Lautrec was commissioned to produce decorations for the salon walls of the Rue d'Amboise brothel, and he decided to design 16 panels in the style of Louis XV, each one centring on an oval portraits of one of the girls. It was during this time that Lautrec had the opportunity to study their lifestyle at close quarters.He was fascinated to discover that many of them were deeply in love with each other, and he frequently made these couples the subjects of his paintings. He thereby succeeded in portraying the genuine depth of these lesbian relationships without exposing the girls' tenderness and helplessness to voyeurism

10446-portrait.jpg	This portrait represents an unidentified gentleman, bust length, wearing black with a white collar. It is dated to the mid 1620s based on stylistic comparison with other male bust length portraits by Crespi, such as his anonymous portraits in the Accademia Ligustica di Belle Arti, Genoa, and his Portrait of Antonio Olgiati (private collection). Similar to those works, this striking portrait is rendered with a plasticity of form, accentuated by the sharp lighting of the head from the left, and a delicate precision in the painting of facial features and hair.

23222-2marriag.jpg	At times the painting of Lorenzo Veneziano is charged with gentle naturalism, as in this Marriage of St Catherine, signed and dated 2nd. February, 1359 (more Veneto). The painting was certainly painted as the central panel of a polyptych. The way the Virgin holds her Son as He almost slips from her knee to place the ring on the finger of St Catherine is finely observed and rendered, while the angels, all intent on playing their musical instruments, seem to go beyond the limits of the picture itself. The fluid handling of movement is very reminiscent of the impetuous gothicism of Vitale di Bologna, while the soft, gentle range of colours and the careful attention to detail in the figures of St Catherine and her companion recall the tender realism of Tommaso da Modena.The date is legible at the bottom. The year is 1359 in the Venetian style, which corresponds to 1360

10080-08altar.jpg	The subject of the triptych is the legendary family of Christ, derived from the idea of Anne's three marriages with Joachim, Cleophas and Salomas. In the central panel Mary is seen with her mother tending the infant Jesus while her husband Joseph sleeps. Mary is said to have had two similarly named stepsisters, whose marriages with Zebedee and with Alphaeus produced the Apostles John the Evangelist and James the Greater (right) and James the Less and Joseph and Simon and Jude (left and centre).There are actual political comments in the painting: Elector Frederick the Wise and his brother, Duke John the Steadfast are shown full-length in the side wings in the roles of husbands of Mary's two stepsisters. The second and third husbands of Anne seen in the gallery are given the features of Emperor Maximilian and one of his advisers at court. The painting suggests the loyalty of the Saxons towards the Imperial court.On his journey to the Netherlands in 1508, Cranach may have seen Quentin Massys's St Anne Altarpiece which Massys was currently working on.

Angelica was loved by several knights, Christian and pagan, among them the Christian hero Orlando (Roland). He was maddened (furioso) with grief and jealousy because she became the lover of, and eventually married, the Moor Medoro.The fresco portrays a scene from the love story of the young knight and the maiden Angelica from Ariosto's ""Orlando furioso"". The two are given temporary shelter by a shepherd couple, once Angelica has found and cared for the wounded Medoro.

In the foreground a viper aims its forked tongue at the leaves of a cabbage and, on a higher shelf, beside a ceramic vase, a mouse gnaws at a nut.At the lower right, in large capital letters, is a signature which has created a small scholarly controversy. It would appear that Tommaso Salini painted this still-life in 1621, but technical analysis has revealed that the inscription and date are not original and may have been added in the nineteenth century. The sole document relating to Salini is his last will and testament of 12 September 1625 and the posthumous inventory of his property drawn up between 14 and 16 September. The summary descriptions in the inventory were endorsed by the flower painter par excellence, Mario Nuzzi, called Mario de' Fiori, who was the pupil and nephew of Salini as well as his heir. The lists drawn up in his presence make no mention of paintings similar to this still-life. With these invaluable documents to hand, the name 'Salini' must be looked at in a new light. It has been suggested that he was a flower painter and the teacher of Nuzzi. This would mean that Salini was neither the author of this painting nor the others like it which have been attributed to him

06653-carnival.jpg	"If Pieter Bruegel the Elder enjoyed a solid reputation during his lifetime, his paintings were ""even more sought after following his death"" (in 1569), as Provost Morillon wrote to Cardinal de Granvelle as early as 1572. It is probably this constant demand which led the famous painter's oldest son, registered as a master in the Antwerp guild in 1584/85, to specialise in copying hisfather's works. The Battle of Carnival and Lent, the original of which is conserved in Vienna, is a very fine example of this. The subject matter can be found in medieval literature and plays.In the foreground, two opposing processions, the one to the left led by the replete figure of Carnival and the one to the right by the haggard figure of Lent, are about to confront each other in a burlesque parody of a joust. Here, on either side of the picture, are feasting and fasting, winter and spring (the trees to the left are leafless, those to the right have leaves), popular jollity and well-ordered charity, the ill-famed tavern and the church as the refuge of the pious soul. Whilst the father's work was not lacking in humour, the son's emphasises the encyclopaedic aspect: the many scenes accompanying the ""battle"" are all ceremonies or customs attached to the rites of carnival and lent, which succeed each other from Epiphany until Easter. One intriguing element for which no satisfactory explanation has yet been found is the fool guiding a couple with a torch in broad daylight in the centre of the composition. The group is walking towards the right, but with its back turned both to Carnival and the viewer.The smooth pictorial handling, the richness of the chromatic range and the subtlety of the colours, as well as the extreme care given to each detail make Brueghel the Younger's painting much more than a simple copy. In addition to its own qualities, the painting also acts as a precious witness to the original state of its model: the children lying at the entrance to the church, the old woman bent double in the cart drawn by a poor woman in rags, and the bloated body of the corpse in the right foreground have all been painted over out of prudishness at a later date on the Vienna panel. The cripple standing with a naked torso on the far right of the son's copy is also absent in the original"

04177-charles5.jpg	"During his long visit in Augsburg in 1548, Titan had time to become acquainted with Emperor Charles V, leading to a deeper sympathy with him as a man as well as to a better understanding of his aspirations as a ruler. Contemporary observers were highly impressed by the intimacy that a mere painter should have enjoyed with the most powerful man on earth. Titian's seventeenth-century biographer Carlo Ridolfi recounts an anecdote concerning their relationship, which clearly grew out of accurate reports in circulation at the time.""It is told of Titian that while he was painting the portrait, he dropped a brush, which the emperor picked up, and bowing low, Titian declared: 'Sire, one of your servants does not deserve such an honour.' To this Charles replied: 'Titian deserves to be served by Caesar.'""This story, which was repeatedly cited by romantics in later centuries, was clearly modelled on Pliny's account of the special favours accorded to the painter Apelles by Alexander the Great"

35265-2deadchr.jpg	Rosso executed this remarkable painting for Bishop Leonardo Tornabuoni, a Florentine by birth. One of the striking formal characteristics of this painting is the highly refined modelling of the bodies, which become extraordinarily soft under the effect of a warm, intense light. The artist had clearly abandoned his taste for the sharp-cornered angularities that characterize the linear structure of his Florentine and Volterran works, which are, on the other hand, recalled in the varied range of complementary colours, with their delicate changing colour effects.Christ's naked body has undeniable similarities with works by Michelangelo: the Vatican Piet&#224; and the Risen Christ from the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. What interested Rosso in this case, however, over and beyond the literal translation of Michelangelo's figurative ideas, was to exalt the beauty of the human body, which, following the example of the illustrious model, is accurately portrayed down to the very last detail. The total nakedness of Christ's body, not entirely free of a note of sexuality, forms part of this same tendency.The handsome young body, languidly and sensually slumped in a serene repose, and literally dominating the pictorial composition, retains little of the traditional iconography of the dead Christ, being closer to the pagan representation of the figure of Adonis. Indeed, the signs of Christ's martyrdom, which dramatically concluded the earthly existence of God's son, are barely hinted at in the painting: the small wound in his side touched by the hand of an angel, the thin crown of thorns surrounding the head of the Redeemer, and the rod with the sponge soaked in vinegar and the nails, depicted along the lower edge of the painting

He was a pupil of Adriaen van Ostade, and although he did not equal the latter's fame, and despite being struck down by the plague when still young, he won the esteem of his contemporaries. While remaining faithful to the themes of his master (family scenes, tavern and domestic interiors) the artist did in fact break away from Van Ostade's style, softening the latter's marked tendency toward caricature with a more subtle humourism through which he created figures that were well characterized but in a dignified way set off by caricature.

23461-salome1.jpg	Until 1793 the painting was attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. Then it was recognised as the work of his Lombardian follower, Luini.The absence of biographical information on this painter makes a reconstruction of his cultural background somewhat difficult, although his airy perspective constructions would certainly suggest a link with the Venetian school.Luini was a prolific artist of easel paintings, mostly of religious subjects, with which - as this Herodias reveals - he arrived at a type of classicising painting, rich in chiaroscural intensity, the prelude to an almost North European-style pathos.The biblical source for the painting is Matthew 14:6-11 or Mark 6:21-8, where the daughter of Herodias danced for her stepfather, Herod, on his birthday. As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.It is also assumed that the depicted figure is not Salome but Herodias.The painting was restored in 1977.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

15157-03quarat.jpg	The polyptych is from the Quaratesi chapel in San Niccol&#242; Oltrarno, Florence. The central panel of the polyptych is flanked by four saints, each on a separate gabled panel. The four saints represented are Mary Magdalen, Nicholas of Bari, John the Baptist, and George. In the upper tondos supported by angels and cherubs are the Angel Annunciating, St Francis, St Dominic, and the Virgin Annunciate.Despite the fragmentation of this work, the solid figures of these saints demonstrate the way Gentile da Fabriano's painting developed during the time he spent in Florence. Without jeopardizing the grace of his lines or the richness of his materials, the painter seems aware of the strides being made in art around that time by Masolino and Masaccio. The flowering grass of his early work is here replaced by a tiled floor. Each figure is treated with a solemn human and monumental characterization. He achieved this by a more rigorous definition of the volume the figures occupy in real space. But overall it remains thoroughly Gothic in its atmosphere

21124-shipping.jpg	The imposing Castle Cornet was built in the thirteenth century to guard the safe anchorage of St Peter Port in Guernsey. By the fifteenth century much of it had been rebuilt, and it was further altered by Henry VIII, who ordered it to be strengthened to withstand artillery attacks. In the Civil War the castle remained loyal to Charles I, whilst the island of Guernsey supported Cromwell, and the castle was besieged for almost nine years. After the Civil War General Lambert, one of Cromwell's most important supporters, was imprisoned there between 1661 and 1670. A serious explosion in 1672 destroyed the Castle's Tower, Chapel and the Governor's residence.

18468-epiphany.jpg	"Jean-Baptiste Greuze was one of Europe's first celebrity painters. He built a reputation on instructive paintings that covered the edifying themes of the education of children, the virtues of a simple, provincial family life, and the heroism of everyday activities.Epiphany depicts a peasant family participating in the annual celebration of the ""gateau de roi"" (a Catholic feast held each year on the 6th of January), where the children search for a bean hidden in the king's cake, the finder of which will become king for the day. Just as the philosophers Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were asking the country's bourgeoisie to rid themselves of the distractions and trappings of civilisation - to return to nature and a moral, family life - Greuze's Epiphany makes clear the simple (if completely illusory) pleasures of the honest, peasant family, uncorrupted by the temptations of modern, bourgeois life.The painting is signed lower left: J.

41493-1view4.jpg	Issogne Castle  (Castello Challant) is one of the best preserved and most richly painted castles in the Valle d'Aosta. At the end of the thirteenth century, the family of the Challant rose to become the most powerful clan in the Valle d'Aosta, which they could well defend thanks to their fortified castles (Ch&#226;tillon, F�nis). In 1399 Ibleto de Challant succeeded in buying Issogne as a permanent residence for himself and his offspring. It was Canon Giorgio de Challant Varey (1440-1509) who was responsible for the renovation of Issogne and especially for its wall painting.The rebuilding of Issogne, begun in about 1480, transformed the irregular medieval castle into a comfortable, palace-like residence. The work of the various masons, cabinetmakers, and painters was overseen by and architect by the name of Michael de Ecclesia, about whom nothing further is known. The entry porch and the courtyard loggia were painted by a local workshop from which two names (Colin and Etienne) are scratched in the lunettes of the porch. The style of the paintings can be traced back to the school of Conrad Witz, which radiated outward from the Vallais into Savoy.We cannot know whether the pictures at Issogne were created out of a simple delight in the subject matter or whether the particular scenes  and motifs were selected to convey some sort of moral lesson that the modern viewer can no longer appreciate

23837-2manet16.jpg	�mile Zola (1840-1902), novelist, journalist, critic and naturalist, was an influential French writer and social reformist. He was the founder of naturalism in literature. In 1870 he began the ambitious project for which he is best known, the Rougon-Macquart Cycle (187193), a sequence of 20 novels documenting French life through the lives of the violent Rougon family and the passive Macquarts. He is also notable for his involvement in the Alfred Dreyfus affair, especially for his open letter, J'accuse (1898), denouncing the French army general staff.Manet demonstratively placed a small study for Olympia behind his sitter in his portrait of Zola, who was doing so much on his behalf in essays and a pamphlet. The pamphlet can be seen to the right on the writer's desk. Zola himself makes a well-groomed rather than bohemian impression. The portrait also includes other programmatic material important to Manet: a reproduction of a painting by Vel�zquez, whose work Manet admired, and Japanese artworks - a painted screen, and a coloured woodcut

The depiction of the marchese with his oldest son, Federico (his mirror image at the left side of the picture), as well as Federico's son Francesco (the boy to the left) clearly suggests the continuity of the dynastic line. By contrast, the powerful central figure of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga and the two boys he holds by the hand - Sigismondo and Ludovico Gonzaga, who would also later enter the Church - assure us that with the succession of clerical dignitaries it produces the family has an ongoing tie to the Curia and to the pope

Two white-robed angels floating above her place a crown on her head. She is flanked on both sides by galaxies of angels in yellow and green; the two at the foot of the picture hold a scroll with the first verse of Chapter 20 of the Revelations of St John inscribed in Latin.

17797-702goya.jpg	A dozen bodegones (still lifes) and a painting of birds are recorded in the inventory of Goya's possessions made in 1812 after the death of his wife, and according to his French biographer, Matheron, he painted several still lifes in the market at Bordeaux during his last years there. The present example bears traces of the inventory mark that identifies the earlier group, and is remarkable for the period because of the casual arrangement of the sheep's head with its expressive eye, and sides of mutton. The signature is painted in red as if to simulate blood. For stylistic reasons this and other still lifes of the group - pictures of meat, fish, fowl and game - cannot be much earlier than the date they are recorded in Goya's house. This means that they must have been painted about the time of the 'ano del hambre', the year of the terrible famine in Madrid in 1811-12, when thousands died of hunger, thus raising the question of whether any allusion to the famine was intended by Goya. Were they perhaps meant as a sardonic commentary on the situation in one of the many illustrations of the effects of famine in his Desastres de la Guerra?

05822-1tripti.jpg	The earliest works to have been attributed to Bouts are the three panels of the Triptych of the Virgin, in the Prado in Madrid, and various versions of the Virgin and Child. These paintings are very close in style to Rogier Van der Weyden, sometimes so close as to be virtually undistinguishable. The Prado panels set the main composition within a series of grisaille arches, which are embellished with episodes from the Old and New Testaments. The main scenes are executed in a manner that derives directly from Van der Weyden, down to the very details. Nevertheless, Bouts manages to demonstrate not only his mastery of a style, but also his own nascent originality.The central panel of the triptych represents the Visitation and the Nativity, while the side wings depict the Annunciation (left) and the Adoration of the Magi, respectively

31937-02sacra.jpg	The fresco was originally painted on a wall of the church of San Ruffillo and transferred to the chapel of the painters at the Annunziata at the beginning of the 19th century.Pontormo worked on models of Fra Bartolomeo and Andrea del Sarto, however, he departed decisively from these models and presented a personal reworking of the figurative material they contained by dissolving once and for all the harmonious union of forms arranged in a rationally defined and measurable space, a characteristic of the compositions of the two masters. Pontormo reduced the depth and width of space producing an effect of compression, the figures being arranged in contrasting poses (standing and kneeling, facing forwards and backwards), and characterized by a marked twisting of the bodies, especially in the Virgin and the Child.The expressions are also anticlassical: the fixed gaze outside the painting of St Lucia, the sigh of ecstasy, almost a grimace, that emanates from the presumed figure of St Agnes and expresses all the intensity of an entirely exclusive experience, the petulant and contrary reaction of the Child at the approach of the aged St Zacharias, and lastly the unprecedentedly languid and passionate gaze that the archangel Michael directs toward the Virgin Mary

07930-venus_sc.jpg	"Acquired in 1620 for the Medici collections, this painting, which was already famous in the 17th century, was for moral reasons covered over with another canvas of a more chaste allegorical subject through most of the 18th century. The recovery of the original in 1812 has restored to us a work of great importance in Annibale Carracci's youthful development. If we are to believe the date, 1588, written on the back of an old copy, the painting falls in a decisive year for the young painter: the time, that is, of his evolution from late Mannerist Bolognese culture, already enriched by Correggio, towards the colour-light sysnthesis of Titian and Veronese, from which would emerge the neo-Venetianism at the foundation of the Carraccesque ""reform"".Venus's astonishing flesh tones blush voluptuously at her pressed glutei, a popular motif and proof of the painter's skill."

32981-03velata.jpg	"Tradition identifies the subject with ""la Fornarina"", the woman whom the painter loved in his last years and whose face reappeared in both his paintings (e.g. in the Sistine Madonna) and those of his followers. However, the woman, has never been decisively identified. She seems to represent Raphael's ideal of beauty at this time.The painting shows greater attention to colour and to the rendering of skin and clothes in respect to previous female portraits. The regular oval of the young woman's face stands out against the dark background and her eyes hold an intense and penetrating look. The silk of her sleeves contrasts with her ivory-like skin, and is closely associated with the thin pleating of the dress, held up by a corset with golden embroidery. As in the portrait of Castiglione, the figure radiates a sense of great dignity and restraint. But greys and light-blues dominated the portrait of Castiglione: here the warm tonalities of white and gold take over. Raphael is preparing the wider colour range and the more complex composition which will be expressed in the Portrait of Leo X"

12313-7poly28.jpg	Definite Duccio authorship is ascribed to the Madonna of the Polyptych no. 28 in the Pinacoteca of Siena. The whole work is assigned to the production of the workshop (perhaps partly because of its very bad condition) since it reveals a considerable amount of help, valuable but extensive, in the side panels and the pinnacles.The altarpiece in several sections bring together ten figures: the Madonna and Child, as well as several angels and saints on two levels. Originally, it was probably enclosed in a wooden frame. Mary and the Child occupy the central position. She is flanked on either side by a pair of saints, Sts Augustine and Paul at left, and Sts Peter and Dominic.

29528-lacemake.jpg	Caspar Netscher is said to have been born in Prague but moved as a child to Arnhem, where he was a pupil of the local painter Herman Coster before entering the studio of Gerard ter Borch in Deventer. (The central figure in ter Borch's An Officer Dictating a Letter has been identified as Netscher.) He set out for Italy but only got as far as Bordeaux where he stayed for several years before returning to Holland in 1662 and settling in The Hague. He established a great contemporary reputation, . particularly as a portrait painter, and is said to have been invited to England by Charles II. He declined to go, although he painted many English and French sitters in The Hague. His portraits, most of which are on a small scale, were strongly influenced in style by van Dyck and his followers.In his early years, before devoting himself exclusively to portraiture, Netscher painted small-scale genre paintings and also some religious and classical subjects: the earlier ones are related stylistically to the work of ter Borch and Metsu, the later ones, to Frans van Mieris the Elder. This painting was cleaned in 1990 and the correct date of 1662 revealed. It stands, therefore, at the very beginning of Netscher's career as an independent artist in The Hague. It is one of his most successful works, remarkable for the modesty of its subject, its richness of colour and firmness of modelling. It is an image which celebrates the effective performance of quiet domestic duties. The landscape print pinned to the wall (at the bottom of which can be seen the artist's signature and the picture's date) shows how such works were displayed in households which were not prosperous enough to afford paintings

44679-towneley.jpg	Antiquity was the great theme in British painting in the last decades of the 18th century.  Its influence can be traced in two areas particularly - in literature, which often comes close to the macabre, and in the excavations of antique sites, which were followed with intense interest at the time. The excavation sites attracted the British travelers on the Grand Tour, and soon a fever for collecting developed that dominated elegant taste throughout Europe.Charles Towneley (1737-1805) was the most famous of the many English collectors. Zoffany portrayed him in his library with an imaginary assembly of the entire collection in the one room. He is shown with three friends: Charles Greville, a politician, Thomas Astle, conservator of the British Museum, and Pierre d'Hancarville, French antiquarian. The owner of the house and his counterpart, d'Hancarville, who is wearing a Rococo costume, are seated in Baroque armchairs, but the rest of the interior decoration is in the new style. This is determined by the collection itself, which was later donated to the British Museum.

21659-glaces.jpg	At the end of the 1670s Le Brun began the most exacting of his tasks - the decoration of the ceiling of the Galerie des Glaces at Versailles. Many of the sketches for the main compositions survive, and allow an assessment, on a small scale, of his inventiveness, which is usually lost in the vastness of the decorated ensemble. A typical example is The Resolution of Louis XIV to Make War on the Dutch Republic, depicting an event which was to have enormous repercussions (Louis XIV was eventually defeated by the Dutch). The handling, rapid and sure, is taken almost completely from Rubens, and yet the composition is original and dramatic, and demonstrates that Le Brun conformed to the grand tradition of Rubens and Pietro da Cortona in Italy. His work at Versailles shows that he belongs among the great decorative painters on the grounds of his energy, originality and appropriateness of setting, but even in France his reputation is not as high as it should be

19829-4adameve.jpg	By 1515 Hans Holbein and his elder brother Ambrosius had left Augsburg to establish themselves in Basel and were travelling to nearby towns like Lucerne to carry out commissions, often in journeymen teams. Their father, Hans the Elder, was also involved in such projects.Though no prodigy (he was nearly twenty when this work was done) Hans shows how he has already assimilated the contemporary `Swiss' style in the unidealised, thinly-painted figures, whose faces abound with pentimenti - such corrections can be seen around Adam's eyes. The strongly linear nature of his art is already evident in the fluid, abstracted line of Adam's shoulder. This is memorably combined with the telling realism of the worm-eaten apple Eve holds up to view. Such attention to transitory and corrupt nature (exemplified by Adam and Eve) was a frequent concern of artists in the German schools - D�rer, Hans Baldung Grien and Gr�newald. The emotional tone, of regret and world-weariness, is established with considerable subtlety in the faces of the transgressing couple, without the melodrama of much contemporary work, and presages the mature Holbein's psychological insight.Adam and Eve are painted as busts and are set against a flat black background. This choice of representation is reminiscent of half length portraits, especially as the features of the first human couple are scarcely idealized and therefore seem more portrait-like. This is Holbein's way of individualizing the subject of the Fall of Man. The painting cannot have served as a devotional picture, since Adam and Eve were not saints and could not be invoked as intercessors. The picture must therefore have been intended for private religious meditation

41291-07marria.jpg	For a work of this period the panel is strikingly archaic in character. The calm, seemingly immobile figures, the effective silhoutte of the decorative crowns, the spatial depth scarcely emphasized in spite of the tiling of the floor and the gilded background, are characteristics of fifteenth century pictorial art. On the other hand, the manner of painting and the arrangement of the figures filling the space without overcrowding it, link the panel to a later period. This inconsistency serves to enhance the solemnity of the meeting between the saintly women and their queen. Barbara, seen holding a tower in the lower left corner, Catherine sitting above her with a broken wheel in her lap and, on the other side of the Virgin, St. Dorothy with a basket of flowers, and Margaret leading a dragon on a leash like a dog, are the noblest of the martyr virgins. St. Catherine having been regarded as the highest ranking among them, it is on her finger that the Infant Jesus slips the engagement with a play boyish gesture. This unstressed yet very important detail illustrates an episode from a characteristically medieval legend that probably owed its birth to a misunderstanding. It is thought that Catherine's original attribute, the wheel, as represented in a small picture, was mistaken for engagement ring symbolizing devotion to the Saviour. As the role of a betrothed would not have befitted the adult Christ, He is represented here as an Infant in his mother's lap, an ingenious idea hinting at the irrationality of the event.The style of the picture is directly related to that of contemporary Austrian painting, a link frequently found in Western Hungary in several periods

07536-33isaac.jpg	Caravaggio painted a version of this subject for Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, the future Pope Urban VIII and this could be the picture.The artist thrusts the action to the front of the picture frame like a sculpted frieze. Old Abraham, with features reminiscent of the second St Matthew, is intercepted in the act of slitting his son's throat by an admonishing angel who with his right hand prevents the murder and with his left points to the substitute victim. Light directs the viewer to scan the scene from left to right as it picks out the angel's shoulder and left hand, the quizzical face of Abraham, the right shoulder and terrified face of Isaac and finally the docile ram. A continuous movement links the back of the angel's neck to Isaac's profile; and angel and boy have a family likeness.Caravaggio combines a hint of horror with pastoral beauty. In the foreground the sharp knife is silhouetted against the light on Isaac's arm. In the distance is one of Caravaggio's rare landscapes, a glimpse perhaps of the Alban hills round Rome and an acknowledgement of the skill of his one serious rival, Annibale Carracci, whose landscapes were particularly admired

37289-21boston.jpg	Although recently some scholars have expressed their disagreement, in the past the Polyptych in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, was always considered contemporary to the Orvieto Polyptych, or at the most dating from just a short while later. Originally in the church of Santa Maria dei Servi in Orvieto, the altarpiece consists of five panels: in the middle, the Madonna and Child; on either side, from left to right, Saints Paul, Lucy, Catherine of Alexandria and John the Baptist, all within a trefoiled ogival frame. In the cusps, the musician angels and the symbols of the Passion (the column and the whip of the Flagellation, the cross, the crown of thorns, the spear and the sponge) as well as the figure of Christ showing his wounds, suggest the iconography of the Last Judgment.Stylistically this polyptych is closer to the Pisa Polyptych than it is to the one painted for the Dominicans in Orvieto, especially in details such as the slender figures, the long and graceful hands, more fluent and lighter volumes. In recent years it has become almost unanimously recognized as being by Simone, except for the St Paul, about whom there is still a fair amount of doubt

32276-05landsc.jpg	Whereas the mood of the London Landscape with a Man Killed by a Snake is intentionally severe, the Landscape with Diogenes in the Louvre is much lighter in tone and mood. In it the well-known story of Diogenes, the humble philosopher, is depicted. Rejecting all worldly goods, he even throws away his last remaining possession, his drinking cup, when he sees a man drinking water from a stream by cupping his hands. The philosopher's final return to and communion with nature are expressed perfectly in the naturalistic landscape, and although there is a good deal of calculation in the placing of the tree silhouettes, it is the delicacy of each element and the subtle tonality of yellows and greens which dominate. Of all Poussin's work, this type of picture was imitated the least

36389-4borgo2.jpg	Stefano di Giovanni, known as Sassetta, was among the leading Sienese artists of the century. In 1437 he received one of the most extensive, and expensive, commissions in Sienese fifteenth-century painting: a double-sided polyptych for the church of San Francesco in Borgo San Sepolcro (the native town of his younger contemporary Piero della Francesca). The figures and the scenes were to be specified by the friars. The altarpiece was painted in sections for easy transport from Siena to Borgo San Sepolcro, where it was delivered in 1444. It was dismembered in 1752; in the nineteenth century surviving fragments were sold to various collections.As far as its original appearance can now be reconstructed, this great Franciscan altarpiece, like Duccio's Maest&#224; in Siena Cathedral, showed the Madonna and Child enthroned in the front main tier facing the congregation in the nave. The back, facing the friars in the choir, depicted Saint Francis Triumphant standing on Insubordination, Luxury and Avarice and surrounded by eight smaller scenes from his life ranged in two tiers on either side. Seven of these scenes are now in the National Gallery. The panel illustrated here is one of the best preserved. It shows one of the key events of Francis's life, cited in the process of his canonisation: the impression on his body of the five wounds of Christ. The miracle occurred on 14 September 1224 on La Verna. This forest-covered mountain near Arezzo, where he founded an eremetical convent, had been given to Francis in 1213; it is still a site of pilgrimage.There are many textual sources for Francis's biography; Sassetta, however, almost certainly based his interpretation on artistic tradition. For example, the saint was alone when Christ appeared to him, but it had become customary in painting and sculpture to show his follower Brother Leo witnessing the event, as he is doing here, looking up in wonder from his book of devotions. Giotto had already depicted Saint Francis in the same pose, kneeling and raising his arms to the six-winged seraph-Christ. Sassetta is in many ways a paradoxical painter. Like Giovanni di Paolo and all other Sienese artists, he was deeply in thrall to his great Sienese predecessors of the fourteenth century, the followers of Duccio. He had studied Florentine art of the same period as well as of his own time. Around 1432 he became acquainted with French and northern Italian miniatures. Something of all these sources is evident here, in the ornamental forms of the trees, the unrealistic ledge-like rocks of the foreground and the oblique angle at which he sets the chapel nestling in the mountain - a fourteenth-century method of suggesting perspective.At the same time as Sassetta emulated the decorative effects of archaic styles, he could not help but be influenced by the artistic advances of his day. Thus the supernatural light flooding La Verna from the seraph is virtually consistent throughout the painting. Mountain shadows darken the stuccoed fa�ade of the chapel, with its Virgin and Child above the door; Saint Francis's cord belt casts a shadow on his habit, and his parted fingers on the ground behind his shoulder. The miracle - which has caused the wooden cross in the makeshift oratory to bleed and makes of Francis an 'alter Christus,' a second Christ - is felt throughout the natural world, a red sunset staining the Umbrian hills.

00348-judith_h.jpg	"Cristofano Allori trained in the school of his father and his grandfather, the leading Florentine Mannerist Agnolo Allori, known as Bronzino. Even if Cristofano may be regarded as an artist who broke with late Mannerist tendencies and went on to become an express proponent of early Baroque reform ideas, he nevertheless continues to borrow certain traits of ""Mannerist physiognomy"" in order to heighten the effect of a picture. In his most famous painting, Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the extreme contrast between the dark and bearded head of Holofernes and the angelic face of his murderess owes much to the Mannerist school in which he was trained.Allori is said to have created a portrait of his mistress Mazzafirra in the figure of Judith and her mother in the figure of the elderly servant woman. The head of Holofernes may be a self-portrait. If this is true, the picture would certainly be a classic example of the so-called ""portrait histori�"" in which real figures are presented as figures from history. Whether or not this is true, the significance of this painting lies predominantly in the enormous erotic tension that emanates not only from the faces of Judith and Holofernes, but also from the sensuality with which the Old Testament heroine is portrayed. This major theme of triumph over tyranny had never before been presented from this point of view.This is the only painting from the long neglected Florentine school of the seventeenth century whose reputation has always remained at the highest level, and it therefore gained a sort of symbolic value. Moreover, its fame as a masterpiece of the Seicento spread beyond regional borders, thanks in part to its temporary confiscation and subsequent display in the Mus�e Napol�on in Paris between 1799 and 1815. The work is by far the best of the many existing versions, copies, and derivations. Although it is not the prime version of this much-painted composition, it is possibly the only fully autograph surviving example.Allori, a Florentine, painted this canvas during Artemisia Gentileschi's stay in Florence, and surely knew her version."

07557-40baptis.jpg	In around 1605 Caravaggio dealt with St John the Baptist in two splendid compositions, one in the Kansas City Gallery, the other in the Galleria Nazionale di Arte Antica in Rome. The former is laid out vertically, the latter horizontally. Both lend themselves to a modernistic reading aimed at pointing out a certain air between contempt and arrogance. In effect what we are dealing with here are splendid exercises in modeling the body through the play of light and shadow.In the version now in Kansas City, the figure is set before a dense curtain of plants; in that in Rome, there is only the trunk of a cypress tree, on the left.

19395-breakfa.jpg	This early still-life of Heda shows drinking vessels and a salt-cellar made of gold-plated metal with delicately engraved ornamental patterns that gently reflect the light. In fact, the overall monochrome character of the painting only admit a faint sheen. A tall, slim polygonal glass with horizontal grooves and a diamond structure towers above the table like a column. In front of it, almost like a counterpoint, there are two plates, one with left-overs from a berry pie that has only been half eaten. On the left, an empty glass is leaning on the plate. Between the glass and the plate a knife has been precariously placed so that it is threatening to fall off the table at any time. Finally, there are some walnuts and hazelnuts, suggesting that this, too, is a dessert still-life

35278-laughing.jpg	A rebellious character  who as a student protested against traditional teaching methods at the Accademia di Brera in Milan, Rosso became an artist with a highly personal artistic language. His bent for naturalistic, contemporary subjects is evident in this psychological study of a laughing woman whose bust-length figure is embedded into her environment. A dematerialization through variations of light and atmosphere achieves a painterly, impressionistic quality. The work was executed during the artist's prolonged stay in Paris where he made contacts with the Post-Impressionists

01145-desaix.jpg	Crucial in securing Napoleon's success in Italy had been the 'lion of Marengo', General Desaix, who had turned the battle by a surprise attack on the Austrians during which he lost his life. Napoleon commissioned the Lombard painter Andrea Appiani &#151; who like many liberals in Milan had welcomed the French - to create a suitable memorial. In Appiani's subtle conception, the general is still very much alive, reading a service order; only his profile pose (a convention for pictures of the dead) and the distant allegorical figures of Time pursued by Death suggest a posthumous portrait. Rather than Italy, it is his former service in Egypt, where he had earned his nickname of 'Just Sultan', that is acknowledged by the two turbaned Mamluks, and he appears in a peaceful role, with sword sheathed and in civilian clothes

The degree to which Cuyp responded to Both becomes even more conspicuous in works of the 1650s. The present painting is one of the clearest examples  of Cuyp's response to the Italianate landscapes of Jan Both.About two dozen landscapes by Cuyp are enlivened by religious figures, and at least three of them (including the present painting) by the Holy Family on their way to Egypt.

09661-13barber.jpg	The picture shows the vault of the so-called Gallerietta in the north wing of the Palazzo Barberini.The first commission for the painted decor in the Palazzo Barberini was given to Andrea Sacchi who in 1629-30 painted the ceiling of the largest room in the wing occupied by Anna Colonna, Taddeo Barberini's wife. Sacchi painted here the fresco identified as Triumph of Divina Sapientia (divine wisdom). Then in 1631 Pietro da Cortona's coworkers, Giovanni Francesco Romanelli, Giacinto Gimignani, and Pietro Paolo Baldini painted the adjacent chapel, which was consecrated to the crucified Christ (Cappella del Crocifisso). Once the chapel was completed in 1632, the next space to be painted was the so-called Gallerietta on the north side, whose end walls present the painted coats of arms of Taddeo and Francesco Barberini. Cortona furnished the designs for the mainly decorative painting with painted stucco, but left most of the execution of them to his workshop

20606-christ_c.jpg	The picture is one of the 26 panels that once adorned the cells of the Carthusian monastery at Champmol near Dijon. Two paintings of the series survived, their themes being identical: a Carthusian monk is praying below the cross of Christ. St John the Evangelist is standing behind him, wringing his hands in sorrow, his head falling to one side in the same way as Christ's head. On the other side of the cross, to the right of Christ, the holy women are supporting the fainting Virgin.The picture is not a narrative of a biblical event (the monk's presence in the picture would be an obvious anachronism). It is intended to evoke the sufferings and death of Christ both for the person represented, and for the spectator. Indeed, the monk is the most emotional figure of the composition; there is some acquiescence and resignation in the pain of the others. To depict a human person, without the intermediary of a patron saint, on the same scale as the saints and so near to God the Redeemer, was a bold innovation. The painting is a characteristic example of a devotional picture almost devoid of iconographic constraints, its aim being to encourage the prayers, meditations and piety of the Christian, and to enhance his self identification with the sufferings of Christ. The inmates of the monastery could identify themselves with the monk in the picture, just as the monumental Calvary by Claus Sluter in the middle of the cloister may have provided them with a profound experience every day.The scene takes place on a narrow stage in front of a patterned gold background. The groups on either side of the cross are linked by rich draperies to form balanced masses. The generous folds of the draperies are arranged in rhythmical curves which obscure the anatomical structure of the figures; even the posture of the monk is not apparent. The small mound of earth into which the foot of the cross is inserted is softly moulded too, almost as if it were made of a textile material. This use of space, defined within pliable confines, which seem to have been modelled and folded by the artist, is a typical feature of the International Gothic style.Nor do the figures stand in front of a natural background; it looks more like fabric stretched to form a backcloth. Its connection with the composition is achieved by the symbolic relevance of its pattern, a tree which is rooted in the soil of the hill of Calvary and also represents the trees of life and of knowledge. This stylized ornament fills up the empty surfaces evenly. The whole of the picture is enclosed by wide arches with vigorous lines that blend into one another: the contours of the figures, the folds of the garments and the blood flowing from the body of Christ. The lines are flexible and avoid breaks and clashes (as can be observed, for example, at the foliate ornament around the monk's arm)

The figures have a great intensity and individuality, much use is being made of their different poses. Thus Abraham is shown with his body tensed and his face contorted, in the arm holding the knife, we can see the force required to hold it back. Isaac, on the contrary, is shown as having fainted, his body limp and heavy, falling onto his father. The group is well integrated and the volumes are modelled from by contrasts of light and shade.

23340-06manpa.jpg	"Like Lorenzo Lotto's Young Man before a White Curtain, this pale, elegantly dressed, bearded man is shown before a curtain, only this time the curtain is a deep, dark red. It fills almost half of the painting, its fall broken by a green table, upon which the man leaning across into the picture space rests his elbow. It is the man's pose which lends such unease to the composition. Unlike the enduring quality imparted by the statuesque tranquility of Lotto's Young Man, the almost diagonal pose of this sitter suggests transience, a fleeting revelation, an impression intensified by the questing eyes of the sitter and his stangely mute gestures.Whereas the hand on his chest may be interpreted as a sign of ""sincerit&#224;"" - reverence, or protestation (as when one crosses one's heart, or in the expression ""mano sul cuore"") - the stretched out left hand holding the golden paw presents us with a problem. It is difficult not to notice a latent aggression in the spread claw, which appears to be leaping from the man's grasp. Placed as it is, a little right of centre, this detail attracts more attention than its small size would initially seem to warrant, an effect underlined by the gleaming brightness of the wrought gold against the black sheen of the man's coat. There can be little doubt that the claw is central to the meaning of the painting. But how should it be understood? Is it intended as an attribute referring to the sitter's profession or social role? If so, then the sitter may be a sculptor or goldsmith, and the paw possibly an allusion to his name. The lion's paw might then stand for Leone Leoni (c. 1509-1590); a medallist himself, Leoni was naturally interested in ""impresa"", emblems and all kinds of allusions to names, and, for obvious enough reasons, chose the lion's paw as his own heraldic device. Leoni stayed at Venice in 1527 while Lotto was living there. However, these speculations amount to no more than a vague hypothesis, and unless more light is thrown on the origin of the painting, there seems little prospect of ever identifying the man.Attribution and dating can be traced back to Giovanni Morelli, whose method - attribution on the basis of details otherwise considered secondary (e.g. the depiction of the sitter's ears or fingers), but thought to remain constant throughout an artist's ""oeuvre"" - cannot be allowed to pass unquestioned.It is not unthinkable that the paw, or claw, may be an obscure reference to some Latin phrase which, in this context, would have the force of a motto. The motto might be ""ex ungue leonem"" (to recognize ""the lion by its paw""), a synechoche employed by Classical writers, for example Plutarch and Lucian, to refer - by metonymy - to a painter's brushwork or signature, or ""hand"" in sculpture, which immediately identifies the work of a particular master. This interpretation of the paw would, of course, be in keeping with the suggestion that it represents a professional attribute.A conclusive interpretation of this painting is not possible. The historical and aesthetic conditions of the painting's conception and execution evidently precluded access to its meanings by more than a limited circle of Lotto's contemporaries, a problem that makes the painting virtually impossible to decipher today. The precept of ""dissimulatio"", the demand - frequently voiced in the increasingly popular moralizing literature of the day - that the sitter's inward world remain concealed, or veiled, seems to have influenced its conception. The painting shows a new page turning in the history of the mind, a new stage of awareness of subjectivity and individuality. Here was a dialectical response to a feeling that the self had become all too transparent, all too vulnerable, an example of the new tactics required by the self-assertive individual in contemporary social hierarchies"

21475-landscap.jpg	The landscape painting of Jasper van der Lanen was influenced by Gillis van Coninxloo and Jan Brueghel the Elder. These artists applied a traditional 16th-century formula that divided the landscape into successive planes, differentiated by the colour they received: earth tones and ochres for the first, different tones of green for the middle ground and tones of blue for the last, distant plane or background. They enriched this formula by generating profound visual penetrations going from the foreground to the furthest distance, adding great dynamism to landscape compositions

Placed in front of a dark niche, it is partly lit by the small amount of light that shines on it. The light is also refracted by the transparent glass and the wine itself. On the marble table there are three bergamot or Seville oranges and a lemon. Jutting out over the table's edge, a knife with a polished agate handle protrudes through the bright yellow lemon peel, and the porous strip of skin, peeled off in one piece, curls around like a festoon, forming a decorative counterpart to the narrow pointed orange leaves. Showing sweet and sour citrus fruits together in this way, the artist symbolically admonishes the viewer to be temperate and to add lemon and orange juice to wine, as they were considered to have medicinal, humoral and pathological properties

32715-pellegri.jpg	This fresco is located in the 4th bay on the east wall of the Pellegrinaio in the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala. The Pellegrinaio is a fourteenth-century room which took the form of a long vaulted hall situated on the ground floor of the hospital.The role of Priamo in the decoration of the Pellegrinaio is altogether unclear. Although some suspected that he was only Domenico di Bartolo's assistant, his architectural prospect reveals him to have been an experienced painter of architectural forms, whereas his figural repertoire is somewhat old-fashioned and his style of painting in general somewhat wooden.This fresco is a depiction of the Augustine monk Agostino Novello installing the first rector of the hospital, an event that took place early in the fourteenth century. A painted arch, decorated with twining vines studded with putti, incorporates monochrome statues of Adam and Eve in niches at the bottom. In the middle distance of the scene, which is divided into three spaces by the architecture, are various representations of Christian charity. In the background we can see the steps of the cathedral (opposite the hospital) and a portion of its fa�ade.The complete description of the frescoes in the Pellegrinaio can be found in the section of Domenico di Bartolo, who executed six of the surviving eight frescoes of the hall

32872-4virtue1.jpg	"The Justice wall in the Stanza della Segnatura includes a lunette containing three of the four Cardinal Virtues of Christianity (Fortitude, Prudence and Temperance). The fourth virtue, Justice, rules over earthly law from the roundel above (on the ceiling). Fortitude can be recognized by her attribute, the lion; Wisdom, who has two faces, by her mirror; and Temperance by the reins. Fortitude is holding an oak branch, a reference to the pope's family name, Rovere, meaning ""oak.""The great systems for civic and canon law are extolled, exemplified by the two scenes at the sides, Justinian Receiving the Pandects, and Gregory IX Approving the Decretals. The figure of Gregory bears the features of Julius II looking imposingly august, but also worn and aged. The pontiff is enthroned in great splendour, with his triple tiara and heavily brocaded cape.

00274-satire.jpg	Spanish painter and illustrator. He studied at the Real Academia de S Fernando, Madrid, under Juan Antonio Ribera y Fern�ndez and Jos� de Madrazo y Agudo. He worked independently of court circles and achieved some fame but nevertheless died in such poverty that his burial was paid for by friends. He is often described as the last of the followers of Goya, in whose Caprichos and drawings he found inspiration for the genre scenes for which he became best known. Of these scenes of everyday life and customs the more interesting include The Beating  (Madrid, Cas�n Buen Retiro) and Galician with Puppets (c.  1835; Madrid, Cas�n Buen Retiro).Alenza y Nieto's numerous drawings include the illustrations for Alain-Ren� Lesage's Gil Blas (Madrid, 1840), for an edition of the poems of Francisco de Quevedo published by Castello and for the reviews Semanario pintoresco and El Reflejo. The painting Triumph of David (1842; Madrid, Real Academia San Fernando) led to his election as an Acad�mico de m�rito  at the Real Academia de San Fernando in 1842, and he produced such portraits as that of Alejandro de la Pena (Madrid, Real Academia San Fernando) and a Self-portrait (Madrid, Cas�n Buen Retiro). His two canvases entitled Satire on Romantic Suicide (Madrid, Museo Rom�ntico) are perhaps the most characteristic of his works

08983-02campid.jpg	Claude Lorrain arrived in Rome probably in 1617. After his first, youthful works, his style matured, and he began his Ports series. However, he painted only one port with the Capitoline. This work was thus a pictorial reverie in which the Capitoline - and all it represents - became part of an imaginary maritime scene. Nevertheless, the painted architecture is unquestionably the Capitoline and not one of vaguely classicising Palladian or Raphaelesque images found on so many canvases of the era. Claude chose that structure as an unmistakable sign of the centrality of Rome 'caput mundi', a city that is also the heart of Christianity

42540-01christ.jpg	Signature: Signed(?) lower left on the small bench.Provenance: The painting appeared out of the blue ca. 1900. This painting was bought by an antique dealer from a family in Bristol for 8 sterling. Later, it became part of the Arthur Lewis Collection, London, and was exhibited in April 1901, Cat. No. 1 by the art dealer Forbes and Paterson, London. Mr. W. A. Coats is mentioned in the catalog as the owner. It was at that time that the signature had first become visible. Cataloged by the previous owner, Skelmorlie Castle; Scotland, 1904, no. 37. Bequeathed by the two sons of Coats in 1927 to the museum.It seems likely that we have here an Italianate copy after a not yet identified original by a minor Italian master. The numerous borrowings from other artists that were easily discovered by art critics point to a pasticcio more than to the youthful work of a potential great. Italian sources, such as the figure of Christ in the picture by Andrea Vaccaro (Naples, Pinacoteca Reggia di Capodimonte), the Christ in another painting by Alessandro Allori (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum), or the gesture of the Christ's right arm in a work by Bernardo Cavallino (National Museum, Naples), join evident derivations from the Fleming Erasmus Quellinus (Mus�e des Beaux Arts, Valenciennes). This figure of Christ belongs to the repertory of Italian painters and was used in many studios in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.The signature differs considerably in the writing from authentic ones. It can be considered spurious

13629-06ferenc.jpg	"While painters of the Nagyb�nya school were first attracted to painting alfresco by  the beautiful mountains, K�roly Ferenczy had started doing so during his Munich stay.  ""Birdsong"" is Ferenczy's first step to leave Basten-Lepage's ""delicate naturalism"" for his own style. The picture is free from details. The random appearance of impressionism in details of nature and capturing atmospheres, lights and colours hastily painted could not be more unusual for him.Like other works of Ferenczy, ""Birdsong"" is carefully considered as a composition. The picture is limited to the woman embracing the trunk. The forest is symbolized by white trunks of birch-trees, bending leaves and harmonies of green. The picture is filled by a woman in red clothes. The red colour of  her clothes and the delicate greens of  her surroundings contribute to the lyric portrayal of the ralationship between man and nature. Forms are outlined in a  definite way in the soft light glimmering through leaves. The woman is gracefully embracing the trunk of the birch tree. Leaves are not visible over her face which she turning upwards, yet one can still sense the forest over us and smell its cold breath.Until Ferenczy arrived at the final version, he had done two drawings and a sketch in oil"

17561-19portra.jpg	Gossart's Magdalen dates to the end of his career, when he became quite interested in placing his figures in crowded stone architectural settings. In addition, Gossart's increasingly mannered attempts to reference marble sculpture by accentuating the three-dimensionality of his figures and the porcelain-like, polished surfaces of heads and hands is especially characteristic of his output in the late 1520s until his death in 1532. He crafted elaborate details and luminous surfaces in the Netherlandish tradition, but he also introduced classical elements such as the antique-inspired urn that foreshadows Mary's anointment of Christ's feet

09029-06hagar.jpg	A pair of landscapes, the Expulsion of Hagar and the Landscape with Hagar and the Angel of 1668 in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, are further examples of Claude's often-repeated essay on the theme of the morning and evening landscape. Again, the figures play a tiny and almost insignificant part in the picture, although in the Expulsion there is a feeling that they are reacting to the inhospitable nature of the cool morning. Such pictures, or pendants as they came to be known, were a great favourite with collectors because they were easier to hang in a room whose design was formal. A surprising number of painters of all schools in the seventeenth century painted pictures in this way, although an informality of hanging which developed in the nineteenth century has often obscured this.The biblical story depicted in the paintings is the following.Hagar, the Egyptian hand maiden of Sarah was the mother of Ishmael, Abraham's first son. When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ishmael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water near by, so they were both saved. Two scenes, the banishment, and the appearance of the angel are common in 17th century Italian and Dutch painting.The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 173). The pendant of the painting, Hagar and Ishmael in the Desert (LV 174), is also in the Alte Pinakothek

The attendant is portrayed with considerable force and presence in this bold and monumental portrait. The figure is placed frontally, set solidly in space against a background of delicately textured brushwork. The face is carefully painted with a different pattern of brushstrokes, which describe the contours of the forehead and skull and record all the cavities and slackness of the old man's ageing skin.

09324-pitti1.jpg	The picture shows a view of the Udienza Pubblica, one of the adjoining three rooms on the ground floor in the summer quarters of Ferdinando II de' Medici in the Palazzo Pitti.The Palazzo Pitti in Florence, purchased from the Pitti family by the wife of Duke CosimoI de' Medici in 1549 and renovated and expanded by Bartolommeo Ammanati, served as a residence of royal proportions for roughly 350 years. It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno) between 1637 and 1641. The adjoining three rooms of the summer suite were painted at the same time. The first two of them, the Udienza Pubblica and Udienza Privata, served as reception rooms, while the third and largest, which is directly accessible from the garden, was apparently used as an antechamber for visitors awaiting private audiences. These rooms were painted by Angelo Michele Colonna with the assistance of Agostino Mitelli with whom Colonna had established a highly efficient working relationship beginning in 1632.The appearance of the Udienza Pubblica is dominated by two balustrades of a composite order and fourteen larger-than-life-size telamones. The frescoes develop the theme of the triumph of Merit and Truth over falsehood

39734-01sisyph.jpg	Titian painted four large canvases of the Damned for Mary of Hungary, Charles V's sister and his regent in the Netherlands. They depicted Tityus, Sisyphus, Tantalus and Ixion, all condemned to perpetual torture for incurring the displeasure of the gods. Only Tityus and Sisyphus are still extant. Tityus was sentenced to have his liver perpetually devoured by a vulture for having raped Latona and Sisyphus to carry a rock endlessly up hill for gossiping about Zeus's affair with Egira. Their gigantism is Michelangelesque, and Tityus is modeled on a Michelangelo drawing of 1532.

37932-celbirth.jpg	In 17th-century Dutch culture, a woman's main charge was to give birth to and raise children. Most parents greeted the birth of a child with happiness and pride, for emotional, and, particularly in the case of sons, economic reasons. A son frequently took over a father's business or trade and would inherit the family's possessions and perpetuate its name. The economic and social benefits of mariage made monogamy imperative. Cuckoldry and illegitimate children caused shame - or mirth, if they befell others.This painting by Steen of revelers in a lying-in room suggests elation by its busy conversation, laughter, and drinking, as well as its bright colour scheme. Most of the visitors are women: men, including the father, were considered out of place at these events, useful only for money to sustain the celebration. The aging father in Steen's painting awkwardly holds the children as he reaches into his purse for more funds. He has good reason to be uncomfortable, as a younger man mocks him with two fingers behind his head, marking him a cuckold who may not know that his child is not his. The joke is in keeping with comic accounts of birth celebrations as gathering of crones and maidens gossiping about sex. Midwives and nurses were considered primary perpetrators of such transgressive talk. Their unclear status, always moving between households, made them mythic purveyors of bawdy chatters. As elsewhere, loquaciousness was generally found more appropriate for men than for women.Although Steen's interior is up-to-date for a middle-class family of the 1660s, his nursery celebration seems old-fashioned for that period, exaggerated to comic effect

20091-18hooch.jpg	The painting is signed with the artist's initials and dated lower right on the bench: P.D.H./1658. The picture was painted in Delft where the artist is recorded in 1652, and where he remained until 1661. From these years date the first works in De Hooch's fully mature style. The move from Rotterdam, where he had lived previously, coincided with a change in subject matter and a new approach to composition. Where before the artist had been preoccupied with rustic settings, the paintings in Delft concentrate more on bourgeois society seen in the context of well-ordered and strikingly lit interiors or carefully observed outdoor scenes.These new developments in De Hooch's oeuvre were most probably inspired by local artists in Delft such as Carel Fabritius, Gerard Houckgeest and Emanuel de Witte, who were principally architectural painters interested in creating new illusionistic effects through the application of perspective. The View of Delft by Fabritius (National Gallery, London) stands as testimony to the form these early experiments took, just as A Lady at the Virginals by Vermeer shows the style brought to an unrivalled degree of perfection. De Hooch played a prominent part in the creation of the Delft school of painting. No earlier works had so successfully applied a cogent perspective system to the naturalistic representation of genre themes in secular spaces.Several other paintings, also of outstanding quality, date from the same year as Cardplayers in a Sunlit Room including A Girl drinking with Two Soldiers (Paris, Louvre), A Soldier paying a Hostess (Marquess of Bute's collection) and The Courtyard of a House in Delft with a Woman and a Child (London, National Gallery). The mood of these pictures is calm and reflective, the actions of the figures restrained, and the rhythms languorous. There is a concentration on detail, as, for example, in the depiction of the playing cards, the raised glass and the broken pipe on the floor, in the lower right corner, which clearly absorbed the artist and enthrals the viewer. Such details help to create an atmosphere that is almost palpable in its freshness. The mother-of-pearl tone of the picture is enhanced by the use of pale colours against a grey ground, assisted by blending them with white.The view through from the shadowy interior to the sunlit courtyard in the middle distance allows De Hooch to exploit his skill in the handling of light as it falls over the different surfaces. This is particularly apparent in the rendering of the translucent curtains and the panes of glass, as well as the way in which light helps to define the forms of the figures.If the overall visual effect of the picture is one of a highly wrought finish, this is to some extent belied by the surprisingly broad handling of paint, particularly in the figures, and the almost matter-of-fact laying in of the squares on the tiled floor. Under-drawing is visible for the layout of the floor, and several compositional changes can be detected: for instance, the man drinking to the left of the group playing cards was originally given a hat. Unlike certain Dutch paintings of this type, De Hooch seems to have made no use of symbolism. The painting hung high on the wall on the right surely does not have a hidden meaning, but the broken pipe and the playing cards are perhaps open to interpretation.The painting remained in Holland until the early nineteenth century. In 1823 the dealer, C. J. Nieuwenhuys, stated that 'its novelty awakened the attention of collectors both in France and England.' Two years later it is first recorded in England. Finally, it was acquired by Lord Farnborough for George IV in 1827

33402-03passio.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 560.This painting is part of a series on the Life of Christ painted for the Stadholder, Prince Frederick-Henry of Orange (1584-1647). This series, which is now in Munich, comprises six paintings and originally included a seventh, now lost, the Circumcision. Frederick-Henry's interest was doubtless first kindled by his Secretary, Constantijn Huygens (1596-1587), who was an admirer of Rembrandt. The commission was not executed in biblical order and may well have been given by stages beginning with the Descent from the Cross in 1632-33.

14947-4arles01.jpg	In October 1888, Gauguin went to Arles on Vincent van Gogh's invitation, to try and build up an artists' community which van Gogh had long dreamed to create. Gauguin arrived on October 20. By December 25, all hopes had vanished, all plans were annihilated. There was the often told tragedy, van Gogh's abortive murderous attempt, when he slashed his own ear. Gauguin fled without ever seeing again his tempestuous friend, who was always to feel bitter about this.At Arles, Gauguin and van Gogh worked on the same subjects. Caf� at Arles (Madame Ginoux) Gauguin re-interpreted Van Gogh's two paintings by joining together the Night Caf� and the Portrait of Madame Ginoux.Early in November 1888 Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother that Gauguin was attempting a picture of the night caf� that he had already painted. Madame Ginoux was the proprietor of the Caf� de la Gare in Arles, where van Gogh had lodged upon his arrival in the Midi and the establishment was frequented by prostitutes, three of whom Gauguin has depicted in the background of his version.Gauguin later reworked the canvas, adding the figure to the extreme lefthand side and the man conversing with the prostitutes. These two figures, and Madame Ginoux herself, had already been portrayed by Van Gogh in other works.The work is signed in two places: on the marble table and on the edge of the billiard table

16860-1dome1.jpg	The dominant accent is the fresco in the dome of the cupola, its theme - Paradise depicted as a heavenly retinue assembled around Christ - had been a recurring subject of fourteenth-century frescoes. It probably reflected the effect that Dante's Divine Comedy had on its contemporaries.The inner circle of this concentrically hierarchical image of heaven is occupied by the half-length figure of the blessing Christ which is emphasized by its size. The figure in the aureole is surrounded both inside and outside first by angels and then by three densely packed ranks of patriarchs, prophets and saints, with the size of the figures continually increasing as one moves down, which produces an illusion of depth and lends a certain illusionism to the uniformity of the ensemble. This strictly hierarchical order is interrupted in just one place, by the figure of the Virgin that stands or hovers below Christ. Angelic musicians frame Mary's figure, while John the Baptist as mediator kneels at her right, and at her left a kneeling John the Evangelist turns toward her in worship.This vision of paradise is followed in the next lower section of the dome with scenes from the Genesis. They begin beneath the figure of the Virgin with the Creation of the World, which is depicted in an extremely unusual form here. The first scene are followed by other biblical scenes, the number of which - thirty-three in all - is striking given the amount of available space. The painter created irregularly sized picture fields, and in most of them the scale of the figures is extremely small, which is hardly suitable to the demands of mural painting

14556-05nightn.jpg	Fuseli did a total of four variations on The Nightmare, probably his best-known theme. The example in Frankfurt is the second variation. Though the motif was not inspired by any specific literary model, it would be unthinkable without a knowledge of ghost stories, especially English ones. The figure of the woman lying asleep or unconscious is extremely elongated and distorted, not because Fuseli could do no better, but in order to visualize the horrible oppressiveness of the gnome crouched on the woman's breast, a nightmare and incarnation of unconscious terrors. In the gap between the curtains in the background appears the ghostly head of a blind horse, which anticipates the demoniac aspect given this animal especially in later French Romanticism

32906-4meetin.jpg	In the last episode of the Stanza di Eliodoro, Raphael returns to the symmetrical compositional type of the Stanza della Segnatura. The painting represents. Pope Leo the Great who, with the assistance of God, prevented the Huns from attacking Rome.In AD 452 Pope Leo I managed to halt Attila the Hun, on his way to invade Rome, at the river Mincio near Mantua. The Eternal City was thus saved from destruction. In the fresco, Leo X, in the figure of his namesake, is riding with great dignityin the company of his retinue towards the Huns, who are galloping into the picture from the right. A mere wave of Leo's hand is enough to repel them.The figure of the Pope on horseback is a portrait of Leo X. It was originally intended to represent Julius II, but the Della Rovere Pope died before the completion of the cycle, and his portrait was substituted by that of his successor. The scene is divided into two parts: at left the Pope and his attendants, poised and solemn, offer a gesture of peace to the Huns. Above them, Saints Peter and Paul brandish a sword. At right, Attila and his attendants, also on horseback, are frightened to death at the view of the two saints, whose figures are counterbalanced by an armed foot soldier. In the background are Rome and Mount Mario, on which a fire is blazing.This episode is clearly more fragmentary and dispersive than the other frescoes of the cycle. Many critics attribute this weakness to the extensive participation of Raphael's pupils, led by Giulio Romano

Those portrayed are not taking part in the biblical events; rather, it seems important to them to be seen in this context. The artist arranges them in groups of three, four and five figures on various ground levels, so that they do not overlap too much. As a result, the front groups are standing at the edges of the picture in rather absurd holes - an artistic device that Ghirlandaio employed with considerably more skill in the Sassetti Chapel by making the figures climb a flight of steps. It is likely that the artist had to accede to the wishes of his client and incorporate all these figures, relatives and friends, into the scene.

The example of Pollaiolo can be seen in the creation of space by means of the harmonious placement of the figures in a circle around Christ. A classicizing atmosphere is created by the relief running across the foreground, which places the scene on a stage and separates it from the spectator.

21924-4benci.jpg	"One of Leonardo's earlier works completed while he was apprenticed to Andrea Verrocchio in his Florentine workshop. Here, Leonardo learned a variety of skills that he would master later on in his career. Although this painting is rather traditional, it includes details such as Ginevra's curling hair that only Leonardo could achieve.Although a portrait of Ginevra de' Benci by Leonardo is mentioned by three sixteenth-century writers, the attribution of the Washington painting to that artist has been the cause of much debate. It is now accepted by virtually all Leonardo scholars. The date of the portrait, generally given as c. 1474, and its commission, however, are still discussed. The sitter, born into a wealthy Florentine family, was married to Luigi Niccolini in 1474 at the age of sixteen. It was a customary practice to have a likeness painted on just such an occasion. Recently, however, the humanist Bernardo Bembo has been identified as a possible patron. He was the Venetian Ambassador to Florence from 1474-76 and again in 1478-80, dates that have been suggested for the portrait. Bembo and Ginevra, both married to others, were known to have had a platonic affair, an accepted convention at the time.The heraldic motif on the painted porphyry reverse side of the portrait, with the motto ""Beauty adorns Virtue,"" praises her, and juniper plants symbolize chastity, considered an appropriate choice for a marriage portrait. The juniper bush, ginepro in Italian, is also a pun on her name.Leonardo has painted a sensitive and finely modeled image of Ginevra. The undulating curls of her hair are set against her pale flesh, the surface of the paint smoothed by the artist's own hands. Leonardo's portrait was cut down at the bottom sometime in the past by as much as one-third. Presumably the lower section would have shown her hands, possibly folded or crossed, resting in her lap"

Ovid (Met. 13:750-897) tells how she loved a handsome youth Acis and was herself loved by Polyphemus, a monstrous one-eyed giant, one of the race of Cyclops. The giant set on a promontory overlooking the sea and played a love song to Galatea on his pipes. Afterwards, wandering disconsolately among the rocks, he discovered her lying in the arms of Acis.

29203-13munkac.jpg	"The year 1874 was a turning point in Munk�csy's life: he married the widow of Baron de Marches, which changed his lifestyle fundamentally. The painter, who had an impoverished childhood and was just as penniless as a young artist, all of a sudden became rich; now he came to live in a luxurious villa and had a busy social life. His new lifestyle soon became apparent in his art, too. Following his wife's advise, he gave up painting realist genres, and started to produce the so-called salon pictures, which depicted scenes from the social life of the bourgeoisie.In ""Baby Visitors"" the young mother and her new-born baby are visited by girl-friends, but the real topic of the picture is the luxurious interior of the bourgeois salon and the elegant dress of the ladies. The wonderful richness of colours is the greatest merit of this painting.

09980-samson.jpg	This painting was purchased by the city of Dordrecht in 1632 and installed in the meeting room of the town hall.The two main figures and the general arrangement of the interior in Van Couwenbergh's picture are based upon an engraving of about 1613 by the Haarlem artist Jacob Matham (1571-1631) after Rubens's large panel Samson and Delilah in the National Gallery, London. Van Couwenbergh referred to engravings after Rubens on several occasions. His father, Gillis, was an engraver and art dealer as well as a silversmith in Delft, so that the painter probably had access to a large stock of prints.  Rubens's tour of the northern Netherlands in July 1627 - he visited Delft and was honoured at a banquet given by Van Honthorst in Utrecht - and the Flemish master's stature at the Dutch court must also have made an impression upon the young history painter, whose work in the 1620s was mostly confined to amusing genre scenes.

09028-05europa.jpg	The painting is signed and dated: CLAVDE GILLE IVRI/ROMAE 1667.There are in all five painted versions of this subject by Claude dating from four different decades. The earliest is dated 1634 (Fort Worth, Kimbell Art Museum), followed by the second, dated 1647 (on loan to Utrecht, Centraal Museum), a third dated 1655 (Moscow, Pushkin Museum) and a fourth of 1658 (private collection). The version in the Royal Collection, dated 1667, is the last in the series and in many ways marks the climax of the artist's treatment of the theme. This is admirably reflected in its heightened poetic sensibility and the sophisticated level of technical skills. Of the various compositions, that of 1634 is also recorded in an etching, while the others are included in Claude's Liber Veritatis (LV 111, 136 and 144), which served as an official drawn record made by the artist himself of his painted compositions dating from 1637 onwards.While the basic features of the design and iconography were established in the Fort Worth painting, changes or differences in emphasis occur in the others as Claude modified his style. It is also true to say that the version in Utrecht served as the basis for the later renderings, particularly in the greater spaciousness of the setting. There is a closer compositional affinity, however, between the painting in Moscow and the present picture, although small alterations in scale and in the number of figures and animals are apparent. For the painting in the Royal Collection Claude most probably referred back to the drawing of the Moscow version made for the Liber Veritatis (LV 136), although the picture itself remained in Rome in the collection of Fabio Chigi (1599-1667), who was elected Pope as Alexander VII in 1655 and was one of the artist's most important patrons.There is circumstantial evidence in the form of an inscription made by a later hand on the back of the drawing (LV 136) that the painting in the Royal Collection was made for Philippe de Graveron. An autograph drawing dated 1670, not from the Liber Veritatis, after the present painting is in the British Museum, London.The source for the story of the Rape of Europa is Ovid's Metamorphoses (II, 833-75). Jupiter, enamoured with Europa, the daughter of Agenor, changes himself into a white bull and mingles with the herd of cattle on the seashore where Europa and her maidens linger. Attracted by the beauty of the bull and not aware of Jupiter's transformation, Europa climbs onto its back and is abducted, eventually being carried out to sea. The description in Ovid is immensely poetic and Claude, by this time well versed in mythology and fully practised in its depiction, successfully expresses the beauty of the text in paint. The mood of the picture is established principally by the chief compositional features of trees, coastline, vessels and fortification judiciously placed within the picture space. The wide spatial intervals create a feeling of calm while quicker rhythms required for the narrative are concentrated in the foreground. The tonal values help to create an atmosphere charged with poetic feeling while the soft breeze wafting from the water is almost palpable. The overall beauty of the painting is enhanced by a number of felicitous details, both in terms of colour and of observation, in which Claude's painting matches Ovid's poetry. The care lavished on the draperies, the flowers and garlands, the waves lapping the sides of the vessels, and the down along the flanks of the cattle testify to the precision of Claude's art in creating a world that oscillates between quotidian experience and arcadian bliss

22489-2appari.jpg	The high point of the early phase of Lippi's development is the Vision of St Bernard, one of the finest lyric pictures of the entire Renaissance. St Bernard of Clairvaux, seated at a desk with his pen poised, experiences a vision of the Virgin, who regularly had been the subject of his writings. The confrontation takes place out-of-doors (rather than in his study or in a church), enframed ingeniously by an outcropping of rock that creates a natural bench and bookshelves for the scholar. Behind Bernard, in the dark reaches of the rock, are two chained demons, while in the zone above, Cistercian monks converse or look heavenward in front of their fine Renaissance abbey. Still higher in the composition, a sick old man is being carried down toward the building. On the other side, a sweet landscape sweeps the eye into the distance.The format of the main figural group is echoed by the stony backdrop which, roughly speaking, forms a pyramid. Also included are the donor, Francesco del Pugliese, matched pictorially on the other side by the blond angel, leaning inward, hands clasped in prayer. The colours are confident, bright, and direct, adding to the exceptional visual excitement of the painting. Mary hovers above the ground facing Bernard. Her elegant form and finely silhouetted head are not dependent upon vigorous light-to-dark juxtapositions or even, as with Botticelli, a felicitously found, heavily accented line, but rather on the operation of fragile edges. The same is true for the figure of the saint, where light, colour, and lustrous paint, presumably oil, combine to produce the desired effect. The landscape is rather flat, despite all the implications of deep space. The painting, although not dated, may have been finished by 1485, the approximate completion date for another project of considerable importance, the Brancacci Chapel frescoes

18906-05aurora.jpg	When he became pope under the name of Gregory XV, Alessandro Ludovisi invited Guercino to Rome, where he lived until 1623. His first job in Rome was to decorate the Ludovisi country house. The fresco of Aurora was set in frames painted by Agostino Tassi. The thirty-year-old Guercino unleashed all his flair and fantasy on this composition which has an extraordinarily lively feel to it. This was a direct challenge to Guido Reni. Only a few years earlier Reni had painted the same subject for the Rospigliosi country house, only in his case the result was an elegant, coldly classical, if typically graceful piece

29452-interior.jpg	The Steenwijck tradition of painting church interiors was continued in Antwerp by the Flemish painters Peeter Neeffs the Elder, who entered the Antwerp guild in 1609 and died c. 1656, and his son Peeter Neeffs the Younger, their hands often are virtually indistinguishable.

07610-64lucy.jpg	St Lucy was a local saint of Syracuse, who had been denounced as a Christian by her former suitor and had died from her tortures in 304. Caravaggio may have worked in haste to produce a picture before the feast of St Lucy on 13 December. His Sicilian biographer states that he owed the commission to his friend Minniti, who may also have helped him paint it.Originally Lucy's head was severed from her body but later Caravaggio joined it and left just a slit in the front of her neck - perhaps recalling St Cecilia, whose still-intact body, with a gash in the nape of the neck, had been sculpted in 1600 by Maderno. A more local influence was the crypt of the Syracusan church where Lucy had been buried, for cavernous spaces dwarf the human actors.The heavily-muscled grave-diggers emerge from murky shadows, the mourners are so much smaller that they seem placed some distance away, the officer directing operations beside the bishop is obscured and only the young man above the saint stands out poignantly in his red cloak. Characteristically, light imitates the action of the sun by falling from the right. The scene takes the viewer back to the age of the Church of the catacombs.The painting was recently restored at the Istituto Centrale per il Restauro in Rome (all Caravaggio's Sicilian paintings have come down to us in a poor state of preservation) and transferred from the Basilica di Santa Lucia al Sepolcro to the Bellomo Museum in Syracuse

20960-insects4.jpg	Jan van Kessel's intimate cabinet paintings, which manage to combine an intense observation of natural history with an attractive design, have always been among the most prized of his works. He started painting them in the first half of the 1650s, and continued painting these subjects well into the 1660s. The majority of them were painted on copper, the smooth surface of which was better suited to his meticulous and detailed finish. Many are purely studies of insects, but these are sometimes, as here, combined with studies of flowers or branches of fruit, and occasionally shells.These tiny coppers most probably originally formed part of a series of plates for a small cabinet, in which a collector would have kept his natural specimens as well as other curiosities in small drawers

35939-2bavo5.jpg	During the course of his career there is very little change in Saenredam's style. The expert draughtsmanship is seen from the beginning to the end. The subtle daylight atmosphere and tonal unity of the view of St Mary's Square of 1662 is evident in works painted three decades earlier. His Choir of St Bavo, a view done in 1660 of the great church of Haarlem, which he frequently painted and where he is buried, shows how suitable his delicate blond tonalities and the neatness and transparency of his technique were for the representation of Dutch Protestant churches. The majestic whitewashed interior has been stripped of all decoration. Its bareness emphasizes its structural power. The only furnishings are choir stalls, a simple pulpit, the brass choir screens and lectern, a hanging triple chandelier, an escutcheon, and a memorial tablet.An undated freehand drawing for the painting shows the changes he could make when he translated a sketch into a more precise construction drawing, and then into a painting (the construction drawing for the painting has been untraceable since it appeared in a Haarlem sale in 1786). Most notable are the elimination of a column and its trappings, and the end of one choir stall, and the increase in the height of the choir wall above the triforium gallery; the last named change dramatically increases the spatial effect.In both the drawing and painting Saenredam shows us more than we could possibly see from a single point of view; the peripheral vision of a stationary eye cannot simultaneously take in the very wide angle between the choir stalls seen on either side of their foregrounds. In the painting much more is offered; the observer is not only given a low view into the choir and ambulatory but a view of the choir's towering wooden star-vaulted ceiling as well. These liberties with the conventions of vanishing point perspective were deliberate: they enabled him to increase our sense of the vastness of the imposing interior. Three minuscule figures in the choir and a single one in the triforium gallery also help to set the scale.In the interior Saenredam's fine geometric sense and love of plain surfaces - aspects of his style which are so appealing to our eyes - find their full expression. Only Carel Fabritius and Vermeer were capable of finding such painterly qualities in the rough surfaces of plain whitewashed walls

39495-12priuli.jpg	In such portraits as this, Tintoretto prepared the way for Netherlandish portrait painting of the 17th century. The style as a whole is very sketch-like. The sometimes hatched brushwork is characteristic of portraits executed by Tintoretto from life on the canvas. Zigzag brushstrokes indicate the eyebrows, red dots of colour in the corners of the eyes, and very fine highlights on the pupils bring the sitters gaze to life. The edge of the white fabric cap or rensa, shown as a wavy line, suggests the narrow fit and pressure of the cornu, the Doge's cap, and thus, indirectly, of his office

24099-7parnas.jpg	Around 1495 Isabella d'Este planned to have the most famous painters of her time contribute pictures for her studiolo; she was unsuccessful in obtaining pictures from Leonardo (although he drew her portrait) and Giovanni Bellini, but not for want of trying. Mantegna, her court painter, and Lorenzo Costa, Mantegna's successor, each completed two canvases and Perugino one. Mantegna's so-called Parnassus, completed by 1497, is one of his finest works, much discussed and admired, although the exact meaning of the allegory remains elusive. As a painter dedicated to the study of antiquity and ancient archaeology, it is fitting that Mantegna should have produced a masterpiece with a classical theme.In the centre of the painting representing a mythological scene the dancing Muses are easily identifiable, both on account of their number and the presence of the mountains in the top left of the picture. There was a tradition that the song of the nine sisters caused volcanic eruptions and other cataclysms which could only be stopped by Pegasus stamping his hoof - and indeed we see, on the right, the winged and bejewelled horse engaged in his providential pawing of the ground. Beside him is Mercury, whose presence is justified by the protection which he (together with Apollo) afforded the adulteress in the love affair between Mars and Venus. The two lovers hold sway over the scene from the top of Parnassus; a bed is beside them. The cuckolded husband, Vulcan, springs out from the entrance of his forge, fulminating against the faithless pair. Apollo is seated lower down, his lyre in his hands. Mantegna has integrated the landscape elements with the figures, using rocky cliffs as foils, while the central arch permits a deep vista into the rolling landscape.In this late work Mantegna has maintained a monumental approach to human figures. Stocky and heavy-limbed, they plant their weight solidly in easy contrapposto

19485-fam_port.jpg	"This painting of a family is one of the most important works of portraiture in 16th-century Netherlandish art. It also provides an exemplary illustration of the possibilities offered by the combination of Early Netherlandish tradition, Italian influences and creative talent.A respectably dressed family is gathered around a table whose white damask cloth is spread with food. The father, looking out at the viewer, has a large purse hanging from his belt; his right hand holds out a wine-glass in an inviting gesture, while the left hand with its signet ring rests on his daughter's shoulder. The youngest child in the mother's lap holds out to the viewer the crucifix that hangs from her rosary. The signet ring identifies the father as Peter Jan Foppeszoon, a wealthy burgher, town councillor and church warden of St Bavo in Harlem. By 1530, his wife Alijdt Mathijsdr. had given birth to three children, Jan, then around five years old, Cornelia, about three, and Pieter, born around 1530. The birth, or perhaps christening, of the youngest child may have been the occasion for the commissioning of this family portrait.The clear compositional structure, stabilized by its ""corner posts"" of father and mother yet with no sense of rigidity, reflects both the influences with which Heemskerck was confronted in Rome and his own endeavours to lend plastic conviction to his figures and objects. The richly decked table, on the other hand, with its carefully executed tableware and food, takes up the love of detail so characteristic of Early Netherlandish painting. It is but a short step from here to the emergence of the still-life as a genre in its own right.While the different ages of the three children are accurately characterized, the figures nevertheless remain coolly distanced from the spectator. The inner world of the painting remains hermetically sealed, an impression reinforced by the technique employed for the background, whereby the paint is applied in thin, smooth layers in pale forms which seem to be abstracted from clouds.Heemskerck's Family Portrait, one of his greatest works, was for a long time attributed to his fellow Dutchman Jan van Scorel"

Sylvester closed the dragon's throat so it would cause no further harm and he then revived the victims, much to the amazement of onlookers. In the fresco, the Roman Forum is rendered not as it looked in the fourth century when the scene occurred, but in its ruinous state of the 14th century when Maso painted it. The unoccupied buildings in the background, the dilapidated, cracked walls in which grass is growing and the marble rubble in front of the dragon's cave give visual expression to the decline of the ancient world. The fragment of a pier arcade and the one standing column nevertheless serve to remind us of the greatness and beauty of its architecture

37804-manett05.jpg	The present fresco is one of the twelve fragments to survive from a fresco cycle devoted to scenes from the life of St John the Baptist in the Manetti Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence identified on the basis of engravings made by Thomas Patch in 1772. The frescoes were already in poor condition in 1763-64 when they were restored. When the church of the Carmine was largely destroyed by fire in 1771, they suffered comparatively little. Patch made the engravings in 1772 and removed some fragments from the wall, the rest was presumably destroyed in the reconstruction of the church. The fragment shows a group of three women with the infant Baptist from the scene of the Birth and Naming of John the Baptist

12492-07haller.jpg	Commissioned by the Haller von Hallerstein family, it is a Venetian type Madonna, seemingly an homage to Giovanni Bellini. There is another painting on the back of the panel.This Madonna and Child, which manifestly follows the Venetian precedent of the close-up, half-figure portrait, was once thought to be by Bellini. To D�rer, Bellini was an example of a painter who could make the ideal become actual. But D�rer can never quite believe in the ideal, passionately though he longs for it. His Madonna has a portly, Nordic handsomeness, and the Child a snub nose and massive jowls. All the same, He holds His apple in exactly the same position as in D�rer's great engraving of Adam and Eve, and this attitude is pregnant with significance. The Child seems to sigh, hiding behind His back the stolen fruit that brought humanity to disaster and that He is born to redeem. On one side is the richly marbled wall of the family home; on the other, the wooded and castellated world. The sad little Christ faces a choice, ease or the laborious ascent, and His remote Mother seems to give Him little help.Beautiful though the work is in color, and fascinating in form, it is this personal emotion that always makes D�rer an artist who touches our heart, somehow putting out feelers of moral sensibility

39493-10youngg.jpg	"We do not know the identity of the young gentleman in the picture. He gazes out with a disquieting and indecipherable expression, a characteristic feature of some of the portraits painted by Tintoretto in the years around 1555, such as the Portrait of Onofrio Panvinio in the Galleria Colonna. Some critics detect the influence of Giorgione in these paintings (in fact this portrait was attributed to Giorgione in the inventory of 1819), but this emotional pose, with its penetrating psychological component, is a quality that seems to have been derived from Lorenzo Lotto, as can be seen from the Portrait of a Thirty-Seven Year Old Man by the latter in the Doria Pamphilj collection.The artist's attention is concentrated not so much on a single person, as on the image of a human being's spirituality. This belongs to no single individual and is therefore always devoid of those empty decorative formulas that dominated formal portraiture in Europe at the time.A simple dark cloak trimmed with fur, little or no spatial articulation, warm shades of colour, a granular mixture of paint for the flesh tones, and a simple gesture that leads the gaze up from the hands to the head are the basic elements of this ""open conversation"" that Tintoretto holds with us and with himself"

40859-02christ.jpg	This picture originated from the Carthusian monastery at Champmol and is the external panel of a domestic altar, which consisted of four parts. But, inferring from its style, it was not produced in Burgundy but may have been made in Flanders, in the southern part of the Low Countries. It lacks the sophisticated elegance of Burgundian court art; its naive and verbose narrative and its naturalism were characteristic of illuminators' workshops in the towns of the Southern Netherlands. The fact that from 1369 onwards Flanders was a province of the Duchy of Burgundy explains how the altarpiece found its way to Champmol.The unusual interpretation of the theme makes it probable that the altarpiece was created in a workshop far from cosmopolitan court centres, where local folk traditions were more tenaciously adhered to.St Christopher, leaning on his staff and wrapped in a red mantle with a blue lining, is wading across the river. The Child Jesus, who usually sits on the giant's shoulder, is now waiting on the far bank of the river to be carried across the water. With their identical colours but different proportions, the two figures create a sharp contrast to their greenish-brown surroundings. Another strong area of colour is provided by the red background of the picture, against which the trees show up, as well as a small building with a hermit sitting in front of it. Usually he lights the way for Jesus, but here, comfortably crossing his legs, he greedily drinks from a big jug.The banks rise steeply from the water and, like the river, they appear to tip into the plane of the picture. The water is crowded with fish, whose mere outlines are indicated by the painter. By this device he may have intended to convey the transparency of the substance. On the other hand, St Christopher's foot is discoloured in the water. The figure of a mermaid combing her hair, which is a familiar symbol of an evil spirit leading man into temptation, is also discernible in the river

20592-the_ball.jpg	The Ball depicts a dancing scene, which was one of Janssens's specialities and earned him the nickname 'The Dancer'. At the centre of the composition is a fashionable pair, the gentleman wearing a jaunty red sash across his chest and the lady in a rustling black silk dress. The crowds around them have parted to admire their graceful performance and the plain floor of the interior is intended to enhance the articulation of their movements. The expansive room, with its high ceilings, large windows and the addition of a classical sculpture on the left, gives the interior a monumental feel.Many of the artist's paintings are set either on terraces or in grand interiors. The architectural surroundings, which play an important part in his compositions, were often based on existing buildings, such as Rubens's Italianate house in Antwerp. Additionally, Janssens used the prints of Hans Vredeman de Vries as a source for perspective effects.

26314-portrait.jpg	Franz Messmer (also M�ssmer) was an Austrian painter. The portrait of Jacob Schmutzer was executed in co-operation with Jacob Kohl (1734-1788): Messmer painted the head and Kohl created the clothing, the attributes of the sitter's profession, and the refined ambience. The painting was submitted to the Vienna Academy in 1767 as a reception piece by the two artists. The fact that the painting was accepted as a reception piece for both artists reveals that both parts of the painting were regarded as equally important.Jacob Schmutzer was the founder of the Kupferstecheracademie (Engravers' Academy) in 1766 and director of this school at the united Academy of Fine Arts from 1772

05268-hermit.jpg	The Hermit Saints Triptych was painted towards the middle of Bosch's career. It is perhaps the most important results of Bosch's stay in Venice. Here he enlarged the view of the landscape and sought to capture atmospheric effects. The painting is full of those bizarre and disquieting apparitions that are a distinctive feature of his works.In the centre St Jerome fastens his gaze on a crucifix, secure against the evil world symbolized by the remains of a pagan temple scattered around him on the ground and by two monstrous animals engaged in a death struggle below. On the left, St Anthony the Hermit resists the amorous advances of the Devil-Queen. Snugly ensconced in a cave chapel on the right wing, St Giles prays before an altar, the arrow piercing his breast commemorating the time when he was shot accidentally by a passing hunter. All three saints reflect the monastic ideal: a life spent in mortification of the flesh and in continuous prayer and meditation

17413-jup_anti.jpg	The subject is taken from Greek mythology (Ovid, Metamorphoses). Antiope was a nymph or, according to some, the wife of a king of Thebes. She was surprised by Jupiter in the form of a Satyr while she was asleep, and was ravished by him. The theme was used at different art periods as a medium for portrayal of the female nude.The subject of the painting can be identified unambiguously by the inscription ANTIOPA on the golden cloth just below the right thigh of the reclining nude, and by the presence of Jupiter's thunderbolt by the satyr's left leg.The Jupiter and Antiope is perhaps Goltzius's most overtly lascivious painting, and one of the most erotically charged and explicit images in all seventeenth-century Dutch art.

17945-viewdord.jpg	"Throughout his career Jan van Goyen combined quality and quantity. Constantly innovating, he provided the basic patterns for a wide variety of realistic landscapes produced by contemporary competitors in 17th century Holland and by several generations of imitators after him. This river landscape is a magnificent example of an oeuvre, catalogued by Hans-Ulrich Beck, of twelve hundred paintings and eight hundred drawings, which together form a milestone in the history of art. The quality of these individual works of art is measured, not by their ""uniqueness"" but rather by the amount of creative workmanship that they contain. Production-raising and - as is sometimes maintained - cost-reducing techniques that the artist applied, never led him into the sterile copying of successful scenes.The present view of Dordrecht is not Van Goyen's ""standard"" view of Dordrecht. It is one of thirty known variants of a river landscape with a named city in the background, ""composed"" in the artist's studio. Starting with a simple picture-building structure, a view with a strong sense of atmosphere is produced which appears to have been painted from life at a particular point in place and time, though in fact it has been constructed from drawings, combining accurate observation and ""dressing up"" motifs. Looking out from a vantage point where the Kil and Oude Maas rivers meet, we see on the far side, on a low horizon, the horizontal profile of Dordrecht, identifiable primarily by the Grote Kerk. The illusion of depth is produced by a spit of land in the left foreground where, against the light, a group of people with a dog are watching as a ferry loaded down with cows and passengers is mooring. Whipped-up water, swelling sails on the many small ships and a heavily clouded sky suggest a stiff breeze. Several components in the picture, like the figures, the weather or even the city can perfectly well be replaced by alternatives, without the picture being any less a ""face of Holland"" that Van Goyen was one the first to model, at times with sky and water only.The painting is signed with monogram and dated on the ferry boat to the left, 1653. Signature and another date can be seen on the ferry boat to the right, 1644"

25362-annuncia.jpg	The Florentine artist Sebastiano Mazzoni, who was a poet and architect as well as a painter, rivals Francesco Maffei as the most lively and imaginative painter of the Baroque period in Venice. Under the influence of Fetti, Liss and above all Strozzi, Mazzoni aimed for a style of airily elegant images moving in a space with which he could experiment ex novo in freely imaginative terms. His early training in Tuscany did however remain influential with the result that in Mazzoni the decorative exuberance of Maffei seems to be passed through an intellectual filter even in the bolder examples of figure painting.In the Annunciation, the angel bends over the Virgin who is depicted humbly accepting the divine message. Against the architectural background, the two figures spread over the limited space, while their colours are of the most refined.

37981-liberati.jpg	The painting is signed on the second step to the right and dated in centre.The scene is based on the account of Saint Peter's delivery from prison given in the Acts of the Apostles 12: 5-10:And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him. Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.Steenwyck specialised in painting interiors with complicated perspectives. The subject of the liberation of Saint Peter was a particular favourite, partly because the narrative allowed him to exercise his penchant for night scenes. Numerous variants are known and there are more than six different versions in the Royal Collection alone. Of these the present painting is the earliest in date and the finest in quality. Although it is only first recorded during the reign of George III and cannot be firmly identified in earlier inventories, Charles I, like many of his contemporaries, appreciated Steenwyck's work for its intricate detail and careful finish. At least two of the versions in the Royal Collection were definitely in Charles I's collection and it is probable that the others were as well. Steenwyck worked in London from 1617 until around 1637, but he was more closely associated with his birthplace, the Netherlands.Steenwyck often painted the architectural backgrounds of works in which the figures were depicted by collaborators, although this procedure was not necessarily followed here. The solid architecture with vaulted interiors, thick columns and heavy masonry can be made out in the flickering light of an oil lamp and the dying embers of a fire. The guards slumber in a variety of poses, their weapons laid aside, while Saint Peter and the angel make their escape. The tenebrist effect, which undoubtedly helps to create an atmosphere and heightens the sense of drama, may have been influenced by Adam Elsheimer.

Similarly to several other painters in the second half of the 19th century, he was very much attracted to the events of ancient Hungarian history. This is one of the reasons why he so often depicted castles, the witnesses of stormy events. The Ruins of Di�sgy�r Castle was painted in 1860. The significance of the ruins in the background is doubled by their image, mirrored in the lake.

33309-glasswar.jpg	"Giuseppe Recco had a very extensive high-quality production, characterized by marked cultural eclecticism ranging from the Spanish still-life genre to those of Northern Europe and Rome, and by uncommon iconographic versatility. After kitchen still-lifes, compositions with fish and shellfish, bouquets and underbrush paintings, assemblies of fruit and game, tables laid with food and sweets, and vanitas paintings, in the 1670s he tried his hand at a distinctive, extremely original and sophisticated genre: displays of archeological findings, ceramics, earthenware and, above all, glassware and crystal. The canvas in Warsaw is one of the finest examples of the latter genre.Displayed on a beveled grey marble table is a collection of valuable Murano, Catalonian and ""fa�on de Venise"" glassware in different shapes and sizes.

08847-03orang.jpg	The greatest of the admirers of Antonello da Messina was Giambattista Cima da Conegliano who maintained the poetic purity of his predecessor's language which was characterized by groups of figures restfully disposed, by the purity of his line, by the airy clarity of his light and by the Spring-like freshness of his colour. Amongst the very finest works in all Cima's serenely poetic output was the 'Madonna of the Orange Tree', originally placed in the Church of Santa Chiara on Murano.With trusting simplicity, the Virgin, seated on an outcrop of rock before the beautiful orange tree, offers the Child to the adoration of St Louis of France and St Jerome whilst in the background St Joseph looks after the ass which has carried the Holy Family to this secluded spot which bears all the signs of having been based on the gently rolling foothills of the Alps in the Veneto. Through the transfiguring strength of the light, which is as if filtered through the clearest of crystal, the idyllic serenity of the countryside and of the sentiments achieves a supreme integrity of expression

03568-02reale.jpg	Beaumont's contribution to the painting of the Palazzo Reale includes, in addition to four living rooms, two galleries, of which the Galleria della Regina, later named after him, is one of the largest (60 m long) and the most magnificent of its kind. In 1833, it was separated from the palace complex, and has since served as the Armeria Reale, housing the Savoyard weapon collection.The subject of the ceiling painting in the Galleria is the legend of Aeneas, the mortal son of Venus who escaped from the burning Troy with his father and his son, and after many trials and misadventures landed at last at the mouth of the Tiber. There he became through his son Ascanius the progenitor of the gens Julia.The scenes in the large picture panels documents the most important stations on Aeneas's adventurous path.

17732-301goya.jpg	In this remarkable self-portrait that he painted in the early 1790s, Goya is at work on a large upright canvas, presumably a portrait, his eyes turned away from it towards his subject, which contemporary viewers might well have recognized as themselves. Bright sunshine floods from a large window behind the painter, and he wears a curious hat with candle holders on the brim.It was undoubtedly as a portrait painter that Goya won fame and advancement and the special praise of Carderera, who observed his 'astonishing facility for portrait painting. He customarily painted portraits in a single session and these were the most life-like.' To this Goya's son added a detail that explains the unusual hat, with metal candlesticks around the crown, that he wears in the self-portrait in his studio: 'He painted only in one session, sometimes of ten hours, but never in the late afternoon. The last touches for the better effect of a picture he gave at night, by artificial light.' Goya's biographer, Matheron, also commented on this practice: 'He was so jealous of the effect that - like our Girodet who painted at night, his head crowned with candles - he gave the last touches to his canvases by candlelight.

39092-07rezzo6.jpg	The palace contains significant fresco series. Giovanni Battista Crosato, working with the Lombard quadraturist Pietro Visconti, created the decoration for the grand ballroom c. 1753-56. In 1757, three different artists, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Jacopo Guarana, and Gaspare Diziani, were called upon to paint the ceilings of the four rooms on the first piano nobile overlooking the Rio di San Barbaba. Tiepolo's frescoes appear on the ceilings of the first and last rooms in this series of spaces, the Room of the Nuptial Allegory and the Room of the Throne, respectively.The ceiling in the Room of the Throne represents the Allegory of Merit Accompanied by Nobility and Virtue, Ascends to the Temple of Immortal Glory. Merit is depicted as an old, bearded man, crowned with laurel, he is accompanied in his ascent toward the circular temple of Glory by Nobility, the winged figure holding a lance, and by Virtue, the elegantly dressed figure to the right. Other allegorical figures and some swirling putti witness the scene, in which Fame also participates, sounding a trumpet above. One of the winged putti, located just under the figure of Merit, holds the Golden Book of Venetian Nobility in which the names of families that could claim a Venetian patrician were listed, and where, beginning in 1687, the Rezzonico name was also inscribed

Latona, mother to the twins Diana and Apollo, had fled from Juno's ire, after she fell pregnant by Juno's husband Jupiter. She finally arrived in Lycia. She was dying of thirst and she came forward to drink from the water of a lake. For some reason, however, the local inhabitants would not let her drink from it; they even stirred up the lake's muddy floor to make the water dirty. In response to this rudeness, Latona turned the lot of them into frogs.The illustration of the myth, however, only takes up a small area of the pictorial space.

19980-5brando2.jpg	The pair of pendant portraits of the near-royal relatives and schoolfellows of Prince Edward (Henry Brandon and Charles Brandon) shows that the distilled power of quiet observation that is Holbein's main achievement in miniature `limning' could draw personality and character even out of the very young. Both boys appear as differentiated individuals; Henry impatient with the sitting, on the verge of becoming fractious, the more stolid Charles transfixed by his role as sitter.The refinement Holbein displays here was rarely bettered. The sad fate of the children casts a poignant aura across their portraits; the brothers died of the notorious `sweating sickness' within an hour of each other in 1551. Because the elder died first, Charles was deemed to have been (very briefly) the third Duke of Suffolk, heir to the bosom-friend of Henry VIII's youth, whose third wife had been Henry's sister, Mary, the dowager Queen of France

32938-5foundat.jpg	In the Sala di Constantino, the last and largest of the Vatican Stanze, completed by the workshop after Raphael's death, there is a scene of the founding of Saint Peter's. A cleric/architect displays a design for the church before Pope Sylvester I; it is presented under the auspices of the Emperor Constantine, who kneels in deference to the pope, after having personally inaugurated the construction. The plan is thought to reflect Raphael's ideas for Saint Peter's at the end of his life, a fitting memorial by the master's closest associates and followers. Although sadly damaged now, in its original appearance the painting distinctly exhibited a floor plan with three ambulatories around the choir, side chapels, an aisle on either side of the long nave, towers placed at each corner of the fa�ade and columns standing within the atrium.This fresco was executed by Giulio Romano and Gianfrancesco Penni

32286-14phoci2.jpg	From 1648 come the two Phocion landscapes, the Funeral of Phocion (Earl of Plymouth loan to the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff) and the Gathering of the Ashes of Phocion, now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. Painted as a pair, both pictures are constructed exactly like a stage set. Perhaps it was because this way of creating a landscape was very theoretical that such compositions were imitated so widely; they were seen as the proper way to paint landscape - by construction rather than by observation. The scenes are of great tragedy: in one the good General Phocion has been wrongly accused by the citizens of Athens and sentenced to death, and in the other his grieving widow collects his ashes. The deep melancholy of these two pictures again indicates Poussin's determination to make the mind exercise thought rather than imagination

32973-07sedia1.jpg	"Raphael painted the picture in Rome, probably during the period immediately after the completion of the Stanza di Eliodoro. It soon passed into the Medicean collections. It was already there by 1589 and has been in the Pitti since the 18th century. It was carried off to Paris by the Napoleonic troops in 1799 and brought back to Florence in 1815.A celebrated picture in which Raphael is under the influence of the antique and of the Venetian school, of Titian and of Sebastiano del Piombo. The form of a ""tondo"" is in itself a reminder of Florence and carries us back to the taste of the Quattrocento. Of the form of the tondo the artist preserves and emphasizes the curve with his genial adaptation of the figures to the outline of the painting. And yet the composition is in no way forced, but on the other hand the figures in following the curve become more closely entwined together. This grouping, this closing around the fulcrum of the tondo coincides with the centre of affection - the little Christ, the spiritual centre of the picture. The colour, in spite of its vividness, has a fusion and a warmth which Raphael attains with genial and personal mastery"

15280-109geric.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of ten portraits of mental patients that G�ricault painted in Parisian lunatic asylums around 1820. G�ricault was the friend of the psychiatrist Dr. Georget, to whom he presented the ten works. The project reflected the notion at that time that there was a link between mental illness and facial expression. Five of the ten portraits survived, including the one in Ghent. G�ricault displays an almost scientific interest in facial expression in this work, which is balanced by his Romantic empathy with the depth of this grimacing face. The painting illustrates the pursuit of truth through the concentrated observation of reality that typified the leading Romantic painters and writers
