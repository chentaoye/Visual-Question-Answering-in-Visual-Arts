03044-09mucius.jpg	Mucius Scaevola (Livy 2:12-13) was a hero of Roman legend. When the Etruscan forces, led by Lars Porsena, king of Clusium, were besieging Rome, a young Roman nobleman, Caius Mucius, succeeded in penetrating the enemy lines in disguise, meaning to kill Porsena. By mistake he killed the king's secretary who was sitting beside him. Mucius was seized but, to show how cheaply he held his life, thrust his right hand into the flames of an altar fire and let it burn. Porsena, amazed by his endurance, set him free. He was thereafter called Scaevola, meaning 'left-handed'.In painting, of the Renaissance and later, Mucius stands for the virtues of patience and constancy. His sacrifice was also held to be a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice

After their father's death in 1650, the Mancini girls were brought to France by their mother, who hoped that her brother would help find rich and titled husbands for her brood of girls.The five Mancini girls were to become the talk of Paris thanks to their sumptuous dark haired, olive skinned beauty and wild, flamboyant manners, with the young Ortensia (Hortense in Paris), her uncle's favourite niece being the most badly behaved of them all as she grew up into a bold eyed beauty, who was absolutely impossible to resist.At the age of fifteen Hortense was married to one of the richest men in all Europe, the Duc de Meilleraye, with the couple being declared Duc and Duchesse de Mazarin after their wedding day

27061-maurits1.jpg	In 1607 the Delft city fathers commissioned the Delft portraitist Michiel van Miereveld to paint a portrait of the Dutch stadholder Prince Maurits (1567-1625). Van Miereveld went to The Hague to record his subjects's features and produced this portrait of the prince in armour, with sword and baton, representing his role as captain general of the Dutch army. This picture became the model for all the later portraits of the prince. (A full-length version of this portrait from 1615-20 is now in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.) The portrait was engraved by Jan Muller in 1608and, like countless copies from Van Mireveld's workshop, hung in homes throughout the Netherlands.

16472-4crucif2.jpg	The crucifix was first attributed to Giotto by Lorenzo Ghiberti, who in his Commentaries quoted other works of the master in the altars of the church of Ognissanti, like the Virgin of Ognissanti and the Dormitio Virginis. Originally it was probably located on the presbytery, dominating the nave and the faithful, near the Virgin of Ognissanti.In poor condition, it was kept in a room adjacent to the basilica and attributed to an artist close to Giotto and possessing great pictorial capacities.The work was restored from 2005 onwards by Opificio delle pietre dura from Florence and was attributed to Giotto himself, for a date which is around 1315. On November 6, 2010, the crucifix was reinstalled inside the left transept, enhanced by proper illumination.Intended for the procession, it is in conformity with the monumental representations of Christ in the cross of the time, namely: the Christ on the cross is in the suffering position; the body falling; the belly prominent on its perizonium; the head leaning forward touching the shoulder; the prominent ribs; the bloody wounds; the superimposed feet.The crucifix has small panels with scenes on the ends of the cross: the Virgin Mary on the left clothed in blue, St John on the right, hands clasped, and on top the titulus in red is surmounted by a blessing Christ accompanied by the Book. The background contains patterned gold behind the body of Christ.The cleaning and retouching of the blackened cross has revealed individual brush strokes and the bright colour of the lapis lazuli used by the artist. This expensive pigment now dominates the background of the work. Infrared photography and X-rays studies unearthed clear proof of the authorship of Giotto

34210-diogenes.jpg	The most famous of the Cynics, the philosopher Diogenes of Sinope, who died in 323 BC, is provided here with a lamp by way of an attribute. According to his own statement, he used it in broad daylight to find a 'genuine person' on a bustling marketplace. The subject was much loved throughout Baroque Europe, although it appears that the Italians preferred to depict the philosopher alone, as with this and another painting by Ribera, while the densely populated scenes were more popular in the Netherlands.Ribera was interested in studying different types of people, and even his religious paintings seem to be populated with figures taken from the everyday world about him, in the tradition of Caravaggio. The subject of this portrait must have prompted this depiction of an eccentric outsider, his hair tangled, his beard unkempt, his hands work-worn, dressed in simple apparel, and directing a penetrating gaze at the beholder

05786-portrait.jpg	"In Rome the young Bourdon was exposed to some of the greatest portraits of the Renaissance in the collections there, as well as to the constant experiments of artists as diverse as Bernini, Lanfranco and Domenichino, who all painted portraits. from all these influences Bourdon compounded his own style, which inevitably became a formula, but a successful one. He often painted his sitters three-quarters on, in a soft and even light, and preferred waist-length portraits and a feeling of relative informality. With his curious mixture of Italian influences, Bourdon set the style for middle-class French portraiture for almost the rest of the century.

35682-benthei.jpg	During the years from about 1650 to about 1655, the heroic quality of Ruisdael's landscapes increases. The forms become larger and more massive. Giant oaks and beeches as well as shrubs acquire an unprecedented abundance and fullness. Colours become more vivid, space increases in both height and depth, and there is an emphasis on the tectonic structure of the compositions. He strove to achieve heroic effects without sacrificing the individuality of a single tree or bush. An outstanding example of this tendency is his mighty view of Bentheim Castle.Ruisdael visited Bentheim, a small town in Wesphalia near the Dutch-German border, when he travelled to the region with his friend Berchem in the early fifties. Bentheim's castle is, in fact, on an unimposing low hill, but in his painting Ruisdael enlarged it into a wooded mountain providing the castle with a commanding position. His invention is a superb expression of his aggrandizement of solid forms during this phase. The dense mass of the mountain, obliquely stretching away into depth, and the coulisses on either side of the front edge of the painting are reminiscent of compositional schemes used by the generation of his teachers, but the spatial clarity is new, as are the strong colours, the energy of the brushwork, and the way he unifies the close view of a nearly overwhelming wealth of detail with the most distant parts of the landscape into a consistent whole. The impact of the broad prospect is as intense as the vegetation seen close up. Ruisdael continued to include Bentheim Castle in his landscapes, seen in various settings and from different viewpoints, until his very last years

33600-05group.jpg	"Catalogue number: Bredius 410.Probably Rembrandt's most famous and most controversial painting was given its erroneous title the Night Watch in the early 19th century. The title referred to the subdued lighting and led art critics to seek all manner of hidden mysteries in the painting. The original title, recorded in the still extant family chronicle of Captain Banning Cocq, together with a sketch of the painting, sounds rather dry by comparison: ""Sketch of the painting from the Great Hall of Cleveniers Doelen, in which the young Heer van Purmerlandt [Banning Cocq], as captain, orders his lieutenant, the Heer van Vlaerderdingen [Willem van Ruytenburch], to march the company out.""It is, therefore, a ""Doelen"" piece or group portrait in which the captain can be seen in the foreground wearing black and the lieutenant wearing yellow. What sets Rembrandt's group portrait apart from other comparable paintings is his use of chiaroscuro as a dramatic device. Interpretations seeking a plausible action fail to take into account that the scenery is made up more or less of individual ""types"". The painting includes the entire repertoire of portrait poses and gestures from Rembrandt's store of figures.There is inevitably a sense of celebration in the portrayal of individuals in a Dutch group painting. Yet whereas Frans Hals, for example, draws together his individual participants around a banquet scene, Rembrandt breaks up the group, so that individual characters and participants become absorbed in their own actions, each standing alone"

41121-00antepe.jpg	"This majesty antependium comes from the Walpurgis church in Soest. It is the only surviving Romanesque antependium in Germany. What is noticeable about the voluminous treatment of the robes is the tapering folds of the red cloaks worn by Walpurgis, Mary, John, Augustine and Christ.

This provides a peculiar contrast to the forms otherwise employed in the garments and the bodies of the figures, which are undulating and gently rounded.This example illustrates the exceptional form of Romanesque painting known as the German ""zigzag style,"" or sometimes ""jagged style.""

John Crome, along with John Constable, was one of the earliest English artists to represent identifiable species of trees, rather than generalised forms. His works, renowned for their originality and vision, were inspired by direct observation of the natural world combined with a comprehensive study of Old Masters.

36850-st_peter.jpg	In his years in Italy, Gerard Seghers conformed to the ideas of the 'Tenebrosi'. After his return to Antwerp he could take full advantage of the fashionable interest in Caravaggist painting, which had become an international phenomenon. He became celebrated for his monumental half-length genre scenes. But he was highly regarded in the 1620s for his large religious and allegorical pictures, conceived in a genre style, and mostly done in landscape format. These paintings, such as the Denial of St Peter, contain scenes with numerous characters, depicted with lively poses and facial expressions, grouped compactly together against an undefined background; they are painted half-length or are cut off by the edge of the painting. The concealed candlelight casts a flickering and sharply contrasting gleam on the multi-coloured, theatrical clothing of the figures creating a powerful dramatic effect.These Caravaggist group compositions differ only in subject from contemporary secular genre paintings and just like them are ultimately derived from the compositions of Caravaggio's pupil Bartolomeo Manfredi. There is also a strong relationship with the style of Gerrit van Honthorst of Utrecht, who must have known Seghers in Rome

For Strozzi the main means of expression is colour, so bright and rich compared to his other paintings that it seems an eloquent metaphor for the end to the old man's blindness.This painting, a biblical story depicted as a genre scene, is one of the several versions of this subject painted by Bernardo Strozzi
