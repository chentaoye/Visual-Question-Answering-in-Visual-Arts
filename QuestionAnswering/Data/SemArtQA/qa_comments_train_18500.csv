24968-0view5.jpg	In the nineteenth-century copy of the Sala Baronale in the Castello della Manta, the votive niche with the Crucifixion, so seemingly inappropriate to that era's notion of the knightly life of the late Middle Ages, was omitted and a throne substituted for the fireplace

11649-3doctor1.jpg	In the painted niches at the attic level stand eight monumental figures wearing Byzantine vestments and identified by Greek inscriptions. They are bare-headed and wear halos. Closest to the chancel are Sts Basil, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nazianzus, venerated as hierarchs in Eastern Church. Secondary to them are the doctors of the church Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus, as well as the church fathers Athanasius the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. The eighth figure is St Nicolas of Myra.The patriarchs' bright colours and animated faces have been traced to Venetian precedents; however, the pattern for the overall arrangement could have been the fifteenth-century papal portraits in the Sistine Chapel. The distinct shadows the figures cast on the wall are prefigured there.The picture shows the niche which is located above the scene Building of the Grottaferrata Monastery.

39615-4isaac.jpg	Titian executed three ceiling paintings (Sacrifice of Isaac; Cain and Abel; David and Goliath) for the ceiling of the church Santo Spirito in Isola (now they are in the sacristy of Santa Maria della Salute in Venice). These paintings are characterized by the spiraling movement of the figures, the counterpoised poses and the strong intersecting diagonals. In these canvases we see Titian's Mannerism at its height.Following St Augustine's and St Paul's suggestion, Isaac is seen as an image for Christ's own sacrifice.

23257-03rossi2.jpg	Lotto's beginnigs were probably with Bellini, but by 1505 he already showed astonishing originality. This small allegorical scene, which originally served as a hinged panel covering a portrait of Bernardo de' Rossi, Bishop of Treviso (now in the Naples Museum), is comparable in its scale and strangeness of mood to the 'poesie' of Giorgione and may even anticipate them in date.The churchman's shield facing to the left signifies that during his life he chose the narrow path of learning and virtue symbolized by the child with instruments indicating learning. In contrast, on the right, are symbolized disaster and dissipation in the shipwreck, storm, and wine-loving satyr

15475-2ogniss.jpg	This version of the Last Supper, executed in the refectory of the convent of the Ognissanti was executed in the same year as the St Jerome in the church. It is a famous example of the Tuscan tradition of depicting the Last Supper in monastic refectories.The scene is ample and characterized by vivid, animated lines, as was his style, but it draws on the structural organization that was characteristic of Andrea del Castagno. The spirit is typical of Ghirlandaio, who as ever remains rather psychologically superficial and uninterested in any form of dramatic expression. Jesus and the disciples are not particularly characterized and seem peaceful and rather at ease; even Judas, who though seated on his own in front of Christ, according to tradition, has a serene countenance and composed posture. The figures are sitting isolated next to each other in a row, and are not connected in any inner way. The epochal step taken by Leonardo with the communicating figures in his version in the refectory of the Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan, becomes evident when comparing the two paintings. However, the overall effect is agreeable and there are some ingenious touches.The lunettes offer an easy opportunity to the expert painter - a view of trees in a Tuscan garden beyond the wall; fruit-trees, cypresses, and an isolated palm-tree that appears rather incongruous in the surroundings. To the right, a peacock perches on a windowsill, while other birds flutter around in the crystalline air. The table is covered by a white tablecloth with blue embroidery. Plates, decanters, glasses, saltcellars and knives are carefully arranged in front of each table-guest, as are the bread and cherries. It might even be the realistic and serene representation of a Florentine table of the period

26079-24blessi.jpg	This painting is a reprise with slight variations of the Pasadena Christ, which dates from 1478. The dark background of this painting will also have originally been bluish-green in colour and the robe is not dark brown but red. Although produced later, this version is typologically closest to Rogier van der Weyden's prototype on the triptych of Jean de Braque (Paris, Louvre). The figure is thinner and more ascetic than the one in Pasadena. The face has the sunken cheeks of the Braque type, and the hand raised in blessing has more elongated fingers. It is positioned so that only the tip of the forefinger extends above the middle finger. The appearance of the painting is also related to the Vera Effigies of Dieric Bouts (Rotterdam, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen).The work was not reported until 1937 and the original date 1481 on the frame has been overlooked until now. It is painted in trompe-l'oeil gilded numbers. The date 1480 on the Portrait of a Young Woman (Memlingmuseum, Bruges] and that on the Reins triptych are executed in precisely the same way

29482-skaters.jpg	The picture shows skaters and kolf players on a frozen river bordering a village. Kolf is a centuries-old Dutch sport that continues to be played in the northern provinces. Kolf is a cousin of golf, but players use large curved clubs to roll large balls with the objective of striking sticks - one placed at either end of the court. The game can be played indoors or out, on dirt, ice, or wooden floors. It is often played in or near taverns, and the pace allows time for conversation

17791-610goya.jpg	At the end of 1809, during the French occupation of Madrid, Goya was chosen as 'el pintor madrileno por excelencia' to paint a portrait of Joseph Bonaparte for the City Council. In the absence of the French King, Goya composed this picture, described at the time as 'certainly worthy of the purpose for which it was intended', introducing the portrait of Joseph (after an engraving) in the medallion, to which the figure personifying Madrid points. With the changing fortunes of the war this portrait was replaced (by other hands) by the word 'Constituci�n', by another portrait of Joseph, again by 'Constituci�n' and at the end of the war by a portrait of Ferdinand VII. Eventually in 1843 it received the present inscription 'DOS DE MAYO' ('The second of May') in reference to the popular rising against the French in Madrid in 1808. The surprisingly conventional allegorical composition is perhaps dictated by the purpose for which it was originally painted. It contrasts strikingly with the realism and fervour of the scenes from the rising which Goya painted four years later

00091-hunting.jpg	Willem van Aelst was a still-life specialist prized for his lovely flower and fruit pieces, and he has been mentioned as a sometime follower of Kalf. He also painted a number of elegant game pictures in a clear light. They show close views of dead prey - occasionally accompanied by killed poultry - that include scrupulously painted guns, hunting bags and horns, bells and other gear of the sport. As most trophy pieces they were designed as representative pictures of the sport, not records of the spoils of a specific hunt.In this picture the painter displayed the finely worked equipment of the huntsman on a marble ledge: a velvet hunting bag with chamois strap, trimmed with gold embroidery and fringes, and a tasseled horn. Above it he suspended the exquisite catch of a fat partridge and three small game birds. The exquisite blue of the velvet contains the expensive pigment lapis lazuli, which yields ultramarine colour when ground. It was imported from China. Van Aelst's lavish use of it reinforces the preciousness of the arrangement and confirms its destination in a wealthy home. Most Dutch painters used cheaper, less stable blue pigments.

16481-30stigma.jpg	This painting was made for the Church of San Francesco in Pisa. The main scene and the three smaller scenes of the predella - Dream of Innocent III, the Confirmation of the Rule, and the Sermon to the Birds - are variations on the theme of the Assisi frescoes.The exceptional vertical format of this panel, in which the towering rock narrows the scope of the action, is striking. The kneeling saint seems startled and raises his hands. Christ appears to him, enveloped by angels' wings. The intense gaze between the two figures seems to allow the message that Francis has completely taken Christ to himself and then received the stigmata to take physical shape.

32499-mysticma.jpg	This late painting by Procaccini shows that the painter retained the examples of Correggio and Parmigianino even in his maturity. This is evident not only in the faces and the elongated and twisted bodies (especially that of the Christ Child), but also in the cold, clear lighting of the brilliantly coloured, almost metallic drapery. In the highly controlled, somewhat calligraphic elegance of the composition, with its closed circular rhythms operating on various planes, the typical innovations of Milanese painting are apparent. These influences are evident in the mask-like face of St Joseph, backed by shadows, and in the fluent line and abrupt breaks - as in the right angle made by the angel's elbow, which closes off the painting on the far right

09763-2april.jpg	The Salone dei Mesi (Room of Months) in the Palazzo Schifanoia, one of the masterpieces of Italian palace architecture, was decorated with a series of allegorical frescoes symbolizing the months. The length of the room  is 24 m, the width 11 m and the height 7,5 m. The frescoes are attributed to Cosme Tura, Francesco del Cossa, Baldassare d'Este and Ercole de' Roberti. On the southern wall January and February, on the eastern wall March, April and May, on the north wall June, July, August and September, on the west wall October, November and December were represented. Due to negligence it was in a very bad state already in the 18th century. Today there remained only fragments of the frescoes on the southern and western walls, while those on the eastern wall and most on the northern are in relatively good condition. This means that the visitor can view the surviving allegories of seven months (March, April, May, June July, August and September). In all allegories the episodes are arranged in a three-tiered, frieze-like manner; in the upper sphere, the sphere of mythology, each month and its planet are paralleled by their ancient divinity in a triumphal procession. The middle layer shows the signs of the zodiac, while below are rendered the courtly events appropriate to the particular time of year

26342-sleeping.jpg	Gabriel Metsu was born at Leiden and  is said tro have been a pupil of gerrit Dou. He was active in Leiden during most of his brief career, but like other artists from provincial centres, he was finally attracted by the opportunities Amsterdam offered. He had settled in the city by 1657 and spent the rest of his life there.  His early Leiden works, which include rather broadly brushed religious and allegorical pictures, as well as genre paintings, do not show signs of Dou's influence or the high finish and polished manner assiciated with the Leiden School. It was onnly after Metsu had settled in Amsterdam that he adopted more of the Leiden 'fijnschilder' technique and became a prolific painter of the well-to-do bourgeoisie

43074-monaster.jpg	Verstappen worked on plein-air studies, and his picturesque views aim to capture the beauty of the Roman countryside. The present painting relies on the principles of a balanced composition: after a shady foreground comes a middle ground bathed in soft Italian light. The effect of depth is accentuated by the use of an aerial perspective in the background, as well as the objects found on the sides: the tree, struck by lightning, on the right, and a rocky cliff on the left, serve to frame the composition and guide the spectator's eye towards the centre of the painting, occupied by a classic monastery. The end of the religious service is the opportunity to capture several groups of people in traditional dress, who help animate the landscape and add to the general harmony of the piece

42276-0610vela.jpg	The satirical tradition had spread throughout Europe via the humanists, and Vel�zquez's knowledge of it is evident in his use of ideal types in portraits of the Cynic philosopher Menippus and the Greek composer of animal fables Aesop, possibly painted for the hunting lodge Torre de la Parada, near the Buen Retiro Palace. Both figures are shown full length and would have made suitable counterparts to the pictures of Democritus and Heraclitus by Rubens in the Torre de la Parada.

40761-05icon.jpg	St Nicholas is one of the most popular Christian saints, both in the West and in the Christian East. Because of the large number of miracles attributed to him, Nicholas is highly venerated, and called upon by believers in every conceivable distress. The Byzantine Church venerated Nicholas from as early as the 6th century, especially in Myra and Constantinople. With the Christianization of Kievan Rus' from the end of the 10th century, the cult of St Nicholas was also introduced to Russia, where it spread unusually strongly, with numerous churches being dedicated to him.In the art of the Eastern Church, Nicholas is always depicted in bishop's garments and with a short, white beard and hair; a characteristic feature is an almost impossibly large forehead, signifying his unusual wisdom. Nicholas always wears the omophorion, the distinguishing episcopal vestment, and holds the book of gospels, likewise the characteristic episcopal insignia.As early as about 1200, the half or full-length figure of the saint in the centre of the icon was surrounded on the margins by scenes from his life and the miracles he had worked. From the early 14th century, numerous biographical icons of Nicholas were painted in Russia too, more than of any other saint

18372-1607grec.jpg	This is a smaller replica of the picture in the Hospital de la Caridad in Illescas. It belonged once to the painter Jean Francois Millet, and later to Edgar Degas.The original painting is in the side altar on the left of the main chapel of the church, balancing the Virgin of Charity. Its original place in the church is not known. The painting is not mentioned in the incomplete documentation for the decoration of the chapel, and if, as is probable, it was not painted at the same time, it cannot date much before June 1603, the date of the contract, and was more likely painted soon after the conclusion of litigation in August 1607. In its present position, it makes a grand pair to the Virgin of Charity, and is one of the most splendid of his 'portraits' of Saints.It is difficult, and perhaps not proper, to separate his portraits of Saints from his actual portraits. In both he employs all his means of spiritual or psychological expression. The legend is that Saint Ildefonso, the first Bishop of Toledo, presented an image of the Virgin of the Mantle to a foundation of his in Illescas. The Saint is portrayed before the same image, as he wrote his dissertation on the Purity of the Virgin. The state of inspiration is brilliantly expressed.

05701-venus_to.jpg	No French painter of the 18th century was more inextricably linked to court patronage than Fran�ois Boucher. This picture was commissioned by Madame de Pompadour as part of the decoration for her cabinet de toilette at the Ch&#226;teau de Bellevue, one of the residences she shared with Louis XV. The cupids and the doves are attributes of Venus as goddess of Love. The flowers allude to her role as patroness of gardens and the pearls to her mysterious birth from the sea. As a painter of nudes Boucher ranks with Rubens in the 17th century and Renoir in the 19th; among his contemporaries he had no equal.The toilet of Venus is a timeless theme of sensuous seduction.

16885-corrobor.jpg	It was because of the monarch's known interest in the wider world that John Glover sent Louis-Philippe six of the pictures he had been painting in the British colony of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), where he had moved to join his sons in 1831. Known earlier in London as a painter in the classical style of Claude, he had begun again, painting the exotic landscape and its people in a manner that is surely consciously naive, both in its extreme descriptive clarity and in the sinuous trees that seem exaggeratedly different from European forms. In one of the pictures chosen by the king, such trees arch over one of Glover's favourite subjects, the moonlight corroboree, when the Aboriginals danced at night, clutching green boughs. On the back Glover noted, 'I have seen more enjoyment and Mirth in such [an] occasion than I ever saw in a Ballroom in England.' For a time Glover's pictures hung at the royal chateau at Eu on the Channel coast, but were soon demoted by the curator as curiosities, works of ethnography not art

05935-madonna.jpg	Constructed on a series of triangular rhythms heightened by the violent tension of the drapery, which seems to absorb the figures, the composition has a rarefied atmosphere. Every gesture assumes an almost hieratic dignity, and every figure tends to take on an architectonic fixity. The figure of the Christ Child violently escapes from this formal severity. The audacious, almost explosive gesture of his arms seems to introduce the more serene and contemplative effect of the background, in which unreal, almost stage-set buildings stand out against the luminous sky. The buildings recall Bramantino's work as an architect and architectural theoretician. Of his work in this field, only the mausoleum for the Trivulzio family in Milan has survived

17537-4venus1.jpg	"Jan Gossart played a significant role in the introduction of the Renaissance into the Low Countries. He was the first painter to travel to Rome in 1508 to copy the antiquities there, in the retinue of Duke Philip of Burgundy, the future bishop of Utrecht, a humanist by training. This was a path that many artists from the north were to undertake after him. It is probably also at the duke's instigation that Gossart began painting mythological nudes, a great novelty then in the Netherlands.The little chef-d'oeuvre presented here is one of the painter's most successful ""antique style"" paintings. In a somewhat severe classical d�cor, Venus, with an elegantly and suggestively curved body, seeks to control her son, who awakens passions with his arrows, as the distich in the outer frame tells us: ""Impertinent son, accustomed to tormenting men and gods, you do not spare [even] your mother; spare her or you will perish"". The warning is echoed in the medallions at the base of the columns illustrating the extra-marital love of Venus and Mars: to the left they are surprised by Vulcan, the goddess's husband; to the right Venus is attempting to retain Mars close to her, unless, that is, she is trying to ward off his advances.The theme of Venus and Cupid was a topical one when Gossart was in Rome: Pope Julius II had just acquired an antique sculpture on this subject to which he had given a place of honour. However, Gossart has based the painting not on sketches made in situ, but on two engravings by the Italian Marcantonio Raimondi. One can never remind oneself enough how important engravings were in the dissemination of the canons of the Renaissance. In addition, the proportions of Venus's body respond to the precepts of the antique theoretician Vitruvius. Little dots between the fluting of the columns indicate that the painter used a compass and ruler in order to render them in perspective. The use of a double frame may indicate that Gossart produced this ""antiquitez poeticque"" for his patron Philip of Burgundy. The latter's biographer tells us that the duke liked to add to the painter's works a second detachable frame containing an appropriate legend, in order to be able to display them ""silently"" or ""speakingly"" to a selected audience."

21569-juno_jup.jpg	Lastman was the most important and influential Amsterdam painter of his generation, and his influence persists throughout the work of Rembrandt, the very much greater artist who was his pupil for only six months. After an extended stay in Italy, Lastman returned home to practise 'history painting' - heroic narratives with a moral bias, based mainly on the Bible but occasionally also on classical history and literature, as in this picture. Because he did not rely on commissions he could choose his own subjects and he favoured ones involving conversations and sudden confrontations. Characteristically he has here taken an unusual moment from a famous mythological tale in Ovid's Metamorphoses. As in most of his work, whether on a large or small scale, Lastman has invested the scene with a mixture of Italianate grandeur and a sly humorous realism of Netherlandish extraction.Ovid relates that Jupiter, king of the gods, has fallen in love again, this time with the beautiful nymph Io. His wife Juno, looking down from the heavens, sees the dark cloud he has spread to entrap Io and descends to earth to check on him. Hoping to deceive her, Jupiter turns Io into a beautiful heifer, but Juno makes him give her the beast and despatches hundred-eyed Argus to guard it. On Jupiter's orders Mercury lulls Argus to sleep and kills him. Juno then takes his eyes to decorate her peacocks' tails.Lastman illustrates the confrontation between deceitful Jupiter and suspicious Juno (Metamorphoses I, 612-16). The peacocks who draw Juno's celestial chariot, their tails still dull in colour since Argus has not yet come into the story, are furiously braking their flight. Jupiter, with the aid of winged Love and red-masked Deceit with his attribute of a fox's pelt, two characters not mentioned by Ovid, is trying to conceal the enormous heifer from the goddess. The juxtaposition of heroic nudity with his guilty and rueful expression makes him look foolish. Henpecked husband and domineering wife are old themes of humorous Northern prints and Lastman may have wittily seized this opportunity to graft the native genre onto a Latin tale of adulterous passion among the pagan gods.

13570-0view1.jpg	The Villa Caldogno is the result of one of Palladio's early projects. Its construction began in 1542. The construction of the building and the decoration of the interiors extended over a long period of time, brought to completion only in 1570.

It unfolds in the loggia, the Central Hall, and two rooms on the left. The frescoes in the loggia and the Central Hall are the work of Fasolo, whereas the other two rooms, the Room of Scipio and the Room of Sofonisba, were decorated by Zelotti, with some contributions by Fasolo.The walls of the Central Hall are decorated with four scenes dedicated to villa life, separated by monochrome figures of giants standing on marble cubes.

22340-1charles.jpg	This painting is a 'portrait histori�' with contemporary sitters in the role of biblical or historical figures. The young man in his rich dress is most probably the palatine Prince Charles Louis (1617-1680), the eldest surviving son of the Winter King and Winter Queen, whereas the older man is his tutor Wolrad von Plessen (1560-1632), and they are represented as Alexander the Great and Aristotle.The portrait histori� was rather popular at the Palatine court in exile. They are very often just likenesses of contemporary people dressed to represent biblical or historical persons, but Lievens succeeded in representing the young prince and his tutor as actors who are playing the roles of Alexander and Aristotle in perfection

05475-6annunci.jpg	This picture is one of the jewels of 15th-century Italian art, embodying the achievements that made Florence so famous and influential. The classical architectural setting is carefully rendered in linear perspective, one of the great discoveries of Florentine artists. The figures of the Virgin and the archangel Gabriel, virtually mirror images of each other, are separated by the centre row of pillars, but they are subtly drawn together into a unified composition by the rays of light carrying God's message from heaven. The complex composition, as well as the lyrical quality of the drawing and the transparency of the colours, are characteristic of Botticelli's mature style

01128-s_jerome.jpg	"This panel was intended for devotional use in a home or a monastic institution. The subject of St Jerome in his study was an autonomous one in the mid-fifteenth century in Flemish art. In accordance with Flemish practice, Antonio da Fabriano painted his name ""antonio de fabr[ian]o"" on a fictive cartellino on the bottom of the frame, which is original.Antonio makes the domestic description of Jerome's study humbler and more real through such details as the veining and knots in the wood, the cardinal's hat hanging from a nail, and the small crucifix affixed to the keystone of a brick archway. There is a still-life of books randomly scattered on shelves together with a candlestick and an hourglass. Antonio's Flemish tendencies could be the result of a journey to Naples or Genoa in the 1440s"

24130-1christ.jpg	Between 1490 and 1506, the year he died, Mantegna painted several devotional paintings in which the main figures are represented as reliefs standing out against a mostly dark background. Inspired by reliefs on classical tombs, these figures are shown partially hidden behind stone balustrades or a frame. The present painting belongs to this group.The iconography of this painting is unusual, though used by Mantegna more tan once.

11203-1880s_22.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene.

09005-05paris.jpg	The Judgment of Paris appeared on the art market in 1966. It was recognized as an autograph work, whose composition Claude had recorded in the drawing Liber Veritatis 94, and it can be considered a masterpiece of Claude's mature period in the 1640s. The figures in this painting are among the largest and most painstakingly executed in the artist's work. He worked out his ideas for their arrangement in a vigorous pen study. Claude borrowed certain details from Renaissance models, mining the engravings by Raimondi after Raphael and by Ghisi after Giovanni Battista Bertano

39762-10gonzag.jpg	In creating a pair of paintings of Francesco Maria della Rovere and Eleonora Gonzaga, duke and duchess of Urbino, Titian predictably reprised many of the themes seen in Piero della Francesca's double portrait of their predecessors, Federico da Montefeltre and Battista Sforza. Once again, the male portrait is more rugged and individualized, emphasizing military exploits and adventures. Francesco Maria poses alert in his stunningly rendered, glinting armor, his right arm and baton dramatically thrust out into the viewer's space. Behind him a splendid, plumed parade helmet, reflecting the vibrant, pulsating red of a velvet drape, faces a jauntily angled set of lances. In marked contrast, Eleonora Gonzaga sits primly in her chair, immobile within her highly detailed but much less lovingly depicted court dress. Her pet dog lies bored on a table in front of a window. Titian's landscape is expansive but untraversible, marked by a church tower in its idealized blue distance

25994-02last2.jpg	Christ appears in evangelical guise seated on a rainbow, his feet resting on a gleaming golden globe, surrounded by the twelve apostles and the intercessors Mary and John the Baptist. They are all pictured on a cloud that continues left to the gates of paradise and right to the mouth of hell. The traditional angels with the instruments of the Passion hover in pairs above this divine assembly, while the four angels blowing their apocalyptic trumpets float somewhat randomly above the earth, one of them even appearing high up in the clouds of the right wing. The lily of mercy and the red-hot sword of justice on either side of Christ's head correspond symbolically with the upward gesture of blessing made by his right hand, and the downward one by his left.The rainbow separates the two worlds and their different orders; the ethereal golden space of God's Kingdom appears at the top, while the earth, represented as a wide plain bordered in the distance by a chain of mountains, is shown at the bottom. This will be the valley of Josaphat, which, according to the apocryphal authors (Honorius of Autun, James of Voragine) would be the site of the Last Judgment. The time of day is fixed by the dark blue-green night sky.The figure of St Michael stands on the earth directly below Christ, on the dividing line between the green soil to the left and the barren brown plain to the right. Holding the scales in his right hand, he uses the crosier in his left to prick the flesh of the damned soul, as if to prod him towards the mouth of hell

00840-06_trans.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 6 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In this fresco Christ stands on a rock, prefiguring his rising from the tomb. His arms are outstretched and in this He also foreshadows his own crucifixion. He is voluminously clad in a sculptural mass of glowing white robe, and encircling Him is a radiant white mandorla. His forward gaze does not directly engage the eye of the spectator. At the base of the rock three of the Apostles crouch in awed positions, but they maintain the curious contemplative detachment from the drama of the scene which is the hallmark of this fresco cycle.At the edge of the fresco, on either side, stand the Virgin and St Dominic in positions indicative of prayer, stern and unresponsive to events around them. The heads of Moses and Elias appear beneath the arms of Christ; they are introduced as detached symbols to aid meditation. There is no attempt to create any more than the bare essentials of picture space; this particular spur to devotion required no more. For Angelico, too elaborate a spatial framework as much as excessive use of colour, decoration, or narrative, could detract from the picture's power

37207-maesta_1.jpg	The picture shows a view of the Sala del Mappamondo (formerly known as Sala del Consiglio) with the imposing fourteenth-century Sienese painting of the Maest&#224; by Simone Martini on the east wall of the principal council hall of the Palazzo Pubblico. The Sala del Consiglio was constructed between 1304 and 1310, as part of the upper story of the central wing of the building. The first frescoes were executed soon after it was completed. The first version of the Virgin with Child Enthroned between Saints and Angels was completed in June 1315. Six years later the heads and  in some cases the hands of eight figures were entirely redone. The reasons behind this intervention are not known.Damage to the fresco over time was caused by the storage of salt in basement rooms beneath the fresco. Moisture carried the salt up through the inner walls of the building and caused crystals to form beneath the surface of the paint.

44787-sfrancis.jpg	"Born in 1181 or 1182 in Assisi as the son of a wealthy draper, he died in poverty in the same town on 3 October 1226. Francis' life of poverty, humility, selflessness and serene neighbourly love made the order of Friars Minor which he founded one of the most widespread religious orders in the entire western world. Following the council of Trent in the mid 16th century, St Francis was invariably portrayed as an ascetic, penitent and ecstatic monk, frequently dressed in the habit of the Capuchin monks and with a skull as attribute.Zurbar�n's saint bears the entire complexity of this figure. This is Francis the ascetic, dressed in a brown habit, without signs of office or adornment. This is the humble Francis dressed in the colours of the earth. This is Francis the ecstatic monk, who has received the stigmata of the five wounds. His young face is raised heavenwards in contemplation, one hand placed upon his heart, the other on the skull, the sign of meditation. He is shown as a holy man of spiritual profundity and scholarly intellect, as reflected in his facial traits. Yet he is not a monk who is alienated from daily life and caught up entirely in his mystical passion, but a man close to life, as Zurbar�n shows.

18396-1809grec.jpg	Apostle St James the Less is generally regarded as the same person as James 'the Lord's brother', mentioned by St Paul (Gal. 1:19), who became the first bishop of Jerusalem. Though 'brother' could here apply to any male relation, it came to be taken in the strict sense and was the source of the tradition that represents Christ and the saint somewhat alike in appearance. This similarity is helpful in identifying St James in scenes such as the Last Supper. It was sometimes given as the reason for the kiss of Judas, because the soldiers then knew which man to arrest. According to early sources James was martyred by being thrown from the roof of the Temple and then stoned and beaten to death. The Golden Legend relates that 'a man in that company took a fuller's staff and smote him on the head, that his brains fell all abroad'.Apostle St James the Less in ArtJames holds a fuller's staff, which may be short- or long-handled, having a clubbed head; or it is shaped like a flat bat. It was once used by the fuller in the process of finishing cloth, to compact the material by beating it. From the early 14th century, especially in German art, he may instead hold a hatter's bow, which was used in the manufacture of felt for hats and by wool-workers to clean wool. It may be shown without a bow-string.James was the patron saint of hat-makers, mercers and other similar medieval guilds.

10653-09csont.jpg	"Csontv�ry visited Herzegovina in spring 1903 when he painted ""Roman Bridge"" and ""Arrival of Spring in Mostar"". The picture shows the small Balkan town with the bridge over the Neretva in the middle. The bridge is considered to come from Roman times although it is much younger than that: it was built in the 16th c. during the Turkish occupation.On both sides of the river, houses with peaked roofs line winding streets. Behind the houses, one can see a hill: it is sharply silhouetted against the sky. Csontv�ry's picture reflects the view but he rearranged it to make the composition more impressive: he emphasized important motifs and abandoned less important ones. He united two views in order to emphasize characteristic features. The town appears to be desolate and lifeless, the vast silence is a major component. The pellucidly clean greenish water is flowing in a stately way and the glimmering water is surrounded by rocks as if lazily lying animals. Colours of the picture are bright, yet subdued and velvet-like. This is no longer the world of the small town in the Balkans, it is a part of Csontv�ry's dream world"

21093-chinese.jpg	Kneller shared with John Riley the post of Principal Painter to William III and Mary II; previously he had received commissions from the courts of Charles II and James II and was subsequently to do so from the courts of Queen Anne and George I. He was knighted by William III in 1692 and granted a baronetcy by George I in 1715. His most sustained work for the English court was the series of portraits of fourteen naval commanders, painted with Michael Dahl for Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark (the works were given by George IV to Greenwich Hospital in 1824), and the so-called Hampton Court Beauties, painted for Mary II. Both projects were inspired by similar undertakings by Lely during the reign of Charles II.The sitter (Michael Alphonsus Shen Fu-Tsung) was born of Chinese Christian parents and came to Europe at the instigation of Father Philip Couplet, Procurator of the China Jesuits in Rome. After leaving Macao in 1681 they travelled together in Italy, France and England. Shen Fu-Tsung left England in 1688 for Lisbon where he entered the Society of Jesus. He died near Mozambique on his way back to China in 1691.Shen Fu-Tsung seems to have been a well-known figure at the English court and his portrait was painted for James II. The first reference to the work is by the naval surgeon, James Yonge, who saw Shen Fu-Tsung at Windsor Castle in July 1687, describing him as 'a young, palefaced fellow who had travelled from his country and become a papist (his picture being done very well like him in one of the King's lodgings).' When James II visited Oxford in September 1687, Shen Fu-Tsung was the subject of conversation at the Bodleian Library, where the sitter had apparently helped to catalogue the Chinese manuscripts. On that occasion James II remarked that 'he had his picture to the life hanging in his roome next to the bed chamber.'The painting can be categorised either as a religious picture or as a portrait. The composition succeeds on the basis of the unaffected sense of design and the directness of the characterisation. The fact that the sitter looks upwards and away from the viewer suggests divine inspiration. According to Horace Walpole, 'Of all his works, Sir Godfrey was most proud of the converted Chinese at Windsor.

35759-lesson.jpg	This is one of the first major works by Runge which he painted to express his love for his new wife Pauline, the daughter of a Dresden shoemaker. He made two versions, the first in 1802-03 and the second, more elaborate one, in 1805; only the later work survives. Like Friedrich's Tetschen 'altarpiece', it had an elaborate frame - in this case a painted frame-within-a-frame that was to be read as part of the work. Its various motifs - twining plants, oak leaves and small children - function as hieroglyphs, supporting the allegory. Though it was certainly not what would normally be understood as a landscape, it was based on an aspect of the natural world - one heard, not seen. One will look in vain for a nightingale in it, and it is immediately clear that this is a metaphorical equation of the idea of the young songbird with the human child.Runge took his subject from an ode by the poet Friedrich Klopstock, in which Psyche - the female personification of the soul, shown as is usual with butterfly wings - instructs Cupid (Love) in song in an oakwood at evening, as the nightingales begin to sing; thus the theme is interwoven with the sound of birdsong

05884-rogerang.jpg	Angelica is the daughter of a king of Cathay in Orlando Furioso, by the Italian poet Ariosto (1474-1533), a romantic epic poem about the conflict between Christians and Saracens at  the time of Charlemagne. Angelica was loved by several  knights, Christian and pagan, among them the Christian hero Orlando (Roland). He was maddened (furioso) with grief and jealousy because she became the lover of, and eventually married, the Moor Modero. Roger (Ruggiero) freeing Angelica is a theme very like Perseus and Andromeda. Angelica chained to a rock by the seashore is about to be attacked by a sea-monster, the orc. Roger, one of the pagan champions, arrives riding on a hippogriff (a monster, the creation of the poets of the late middle ages). He dazzles the monster with his magic shield, and places a magic ring on Angelica's finger to protect her. He undoes her bonds and they ride off together.B�cklin's painting is a romantic rendering of the Renaissance tale

The subsequent bronze casting limits the meaningfulness of Rosso's small sculpture somewhat.

42580-13view.jpg	"Signature: Signed with monogram, below left on the boat.Provenance: This, the most famous painting by Vermeer, was part of the Amsterdam sale of 1696, no. 31: ""The town of Delft in perspective, to be seen from the south, by J. van der Meer of Delft; fl 200."" Sale S. J. Sinistra et al., Amsterdam; 1822, no. 112. For F 2,900 to de Vries. Purchased by the state of the Netherlands.Topographic views of cities had become a tradition by the time Vermeer painted his famous canvas. Hendrik Vroom was the author of two such works depicting Delft, but they are more archaic because they followed the traditional panoramic approach that we remember from the two cityscapes by Hercules Seghers at the Berlin museum. The latter artist was one of the first to make use of the inverted Galilean telescope to transcribe the preliminary prints and their proportions (more than twice as high as wide) into the more conventional format of his paintings.Vermeer executed his View of Delft on the spot, but the optical instrument pointed toward the city and providing the artist with the aspect translated onto canvas, which we admire for its conciseness and special structure, was not the camera obscura but the inverted telescope. It is only the latter that condenses the panoramic view of a given sector, diminishes the figures of the foreground to a smaller than normal magnification, emphasizes the foreground as we see it in the picture, and by the same token makes the remainder of the composition recede into space. The image thus obtained provides us with optical effects that, without being unique in Dutch seventeenth-century painting, as often claimed, convey a cityscape that is united in the composition and enveloped atmospherically into glowing light.We admire the town, but it is not a profile view of a township, but a painting, an idealized representation of Delft, with its main characteristics simplified and then cast into the framework of a harbour mirroring selected reflections in the water, and a rich, full sky with magnificent cloud formations looming over it. This is chronologically the last painting by Vermeer that was executed in rich, full pigmentation, with colour accents put in with a fully loaded brush. The artist outdid himself in a rendition of his hometown, which stands as a truly great interpretation of nature"

The saints depicted are on the left Catherine, Peter, Lawrence, Stephen, on the right Francis, Dominic, Bartholomew and two Martyrs.In this picture a massive and strictly speaking classical flavour dominates. Mary, raised on a steep step, is the central figure although the primary subject is the mystical marriage of Christ to Saint Catherine, who is shown kneeling with her back to the viewer. Space is defined by the architecture of the apse, implying that the event is unfolding in a church in the presence of a host of saints.

14697-02andrew.jpg	Robert Andrews and his wife Frances Mary, n�e Carter, were married in 1748, not long before Gainsborough painted their portraits - and that of Auberies, their farm near Sudbury. The church in the background is St Peter's, Sudbury, and the tower to the left is that of Lavenham church. The small full-length portrait in an open-air rustic setting is typical of Gainsborough's early works, painted in his native Suffolk after his return from London; the identifiable view is unusual, and may have been specified by the patrons. We must not imagine that they sat together under a tree while Gainsborough set up his easel among the sheaves of corn; their costumes were most likely painted from dressed-up artist's mannequins, which may account for their doll-like appearance, and the landscape would have been studied separately.This kind of picture, commissioned by people 'who lived in rooms which were neat but not spacious', in Ellis Waterhouse's happy phrase about Gainsborough's contemporary Arthur Devis, was a speciality of painters who were not 'out of the top drawer'. The sitters, or their mannequin stand-ins, are posed in 'genteel attitudes' derived from manuals of manners. The nonchalant Mr Andrews, fortunate possessor of a game licence, has his gun under his arm; Mrs Andrews, ramrod straight and neatly composed, may have been meant to hold a book, or, it has been suggested, a bird which her husband has shot. In the event, a reserved space left in her lap has not been filled in with any identifiable object.Out of these conventional ingredients Gainsborough has composed the most tartly lyrical picture in the history of art. Mr Andrews's satisfaction in his well-kept farmlands is as nothing to the intensity of the painter's feeling for the gold and green of fields and copses, the supple curves of fertile land meeting the stately clouds. The figures stand out brittle against that glorious yet ordered bounty. But how marvellously the acid blue hooped skirt is deployed, almost, but not quite, rhyming with the curved bench back, the pointy silk shoes in sly communion with the bench feet, while Mr Andrews's substantial shoes converse with tree roots. (The faithful gun dog had better watch out for his unshod paws.) More rhymes and assonances link the lines of gun, thighs, dog, calf, coat; a coat tail answers the hanging ribbon of a sun hat; something jaunty in the husband's tricorn catches the corner of his wife's eye. Deep affection and naive artifice combine to create the earliest successful depiction of a truly English idyll

37984-beach.jpg	Whistler's followers included Theodore Roussel, Paul Maitland, Walter Richard Sickert and the young Philip Wilson Steer - that is, the artists widely considered the leading British Impressionists. With Sidney Starr they split off from the New English Art Club. This sub-group used the label London Impressionists. The driving force was Sickert who outlined the task facing British Impressionism: to record the magic and poesy that lay all around in everyday life. London, the great metropolis, provided all the stimulating subject-matter that was necessary.Like many other English painter of his generation, Philip Wilson Steer, who enrolled at the Acad�mie Julian in Paris in 1882, was initially under the sway of Bastien-Lepage. back in England, he settled in London, and from 1884 tended to paint at Walberswick on the Suffolk coast. There he painted the present canvas and similar fresh, outstanding pictures, which he showed at the first London Impressionists exhibition.

In fact it was attributed to Bellini until Cavenaghi restored the picture in 1885. As the panel appears to have been cut down on the sides, its original composition is debatable.

38965-09s_lucy.jpg	Still further proof of Tiepolo's extraordinarily eclectic talents comes from the fact that at the same period that he was working on the breathtakingly secular spectacle of the frescos in Palazzo Labia, he also painted his most religiously intense Venetian altarpiece. In no sense did he compromise the clear sobriety of the architecture nor the brilliance of his palette. Indeed they seem to underline the sadness of the scene.With arms crossed, St Lucy kneels before a priest to receive the last communion. Her half closed eyes and the elegiac expression on her face hint at her later fate. The priests and secular dignitaries who surround her wear magnificent robes, whose beautifully rendered material and brilliant colours are of particular intensity. The scene takes place in front of an imposing palace, upon whose balustrade Tiepolo has again placed spectators. While the bloody knife and the platter with the gouged-out eyes in the foreground are a drastic reminder of the impending martyrdom, the heads of angels which hover over the saint announce her entry into the Kingdom of Heaven

20359-05ingres.jpg	The effects in Ingres' paintings largely depend on drawing and linearity, but he also used colour to supremely calculated effect. The cold turquoise of the silk curtain with its decoration of red flowers intensified the warm flesh tone of the Grande Odalisque. This nude was painted in 1814 for Napoleon's sister, Queen Caroline Murat. Unlike the realism of Goya's Maja, Ingres' nude is hardly intimate, the eroticism here emerging slowly from the reserve and the questioning, assessing glance of the naked woman. This is a tradition that goes back to Giorgione and Titian, but Ingres has painted a living woman and not an allegory of Venus. Nevertheless, the realistic intimacy is lessened by setting the scene in the distant world of the Orient.For many in the West, the idea of the harem with its available or exploited women trapped in their own closed world was as much proof of the fallen or primitive state of the East as was its supposed savagery. But it was also infinitely titillating. Ingres's picture is more than this, however. A sense of loss was inevitably embodied in French perceptions of the East after their defeat in Egypt, and it was perhaps because it sublimated unattainable desires that the theme of the Oriental nude, bather or harem girl gained such a haunting appeal. Ingres is remarkable for combining a frank allure with a chilling perfection of flesh. He had picked up his discreet hints of the harem &#151; a turban here, a fan there &#151; from Oriental artefacts and miniatures in the collections of Gros and Denon. They serve to locate his nude, who otherwise could really belong anywhere, in a sensuous Orient of the imagination

Before them are the friars at the left and laymen at the right; then noblemen and knights, merchant, scholar, finally women and the lower ranks of the society. The basilica in the background is the symbol of the Church. On the right side of the picture St Dominic is preaching, St Thomas Aquino debating the heretics, Martyr St. Peter signalling the dogs (symbolizing the Dominican friars, ""Domini canes"") to tear the heretics to pieces. Above these scenes there is the happy world of music and dance.This rather rigid composition depicts a carefully constructed theological program where the ratio of the figures is determined by their theological significance."

29723-family.jpg	In Lombardy the transition from Mannerism to the beginning of the 17th century was characterized by Giulio Cesare Procaccini, Giovanni Battista Crespi (called Cerano) and Morazzone. They were decorators of talent and were influenced by Emilian, Sienese and Roman trends. Close to their often violently expressive manner with contrasting colours was the Cremonese Carlo Francesco Nuvolone (or Nuvoloni).In this painting Nuvolone has portrayed himself painting at an easel, surrounded by his family. His figure emerges discreetly from the luminous, silvery shadows. Around him the members of his household appear intent on their everyday activities: a quiet conversation, a harp exercise, a moment of melancholy introspection. In effect, the composition is a series of formal portraits, beginning with that of the artist. The figures seem proudly to display their costumes, which are rendered in refined colour harmonies of grays, whites, yellows, and blues

18354-1505grec.jpg	In the early 160s El Greco had established himself as the painter 'par excellence' of Franciscan mystical imagery in Spain. His workshop was producing countless copies after his compositions of St Francis for a demanding market. This painting in C�diz was probably the latest addition to his Franciscan repertoire, and certainly one of the most inventive. The subject of the picture is taken from The Little Flowers of Saint Francis, a popular medieval account of St Francis's life.Using a palette of browns, greys and blacks, El Greco sets the scene against a rock in total obscurity. Particularly noteworthy in the picture the way in which El Greco contrasts the front and back views of the two Franciscan brothers, St Francis and his faithful companion, Brother Leo. El Greco has painted a piece of paper with his signature 'stuck' to the canvas with a red was seal. Casting a shadow on the ground, it functions as a trompe l'oeil simulation of a 'real' business card.

17804-708goya.jpg	This painting, together with A Procession of Flagellants, A Village Bullfight, The Madhouse and a fifth, representing an Inquisition scene, entered the Academy in 1839 as the bequest of Manuel Garc�a de la Prada, who had been a patron of the artist. In his will, dated 17 January 1836, they are described as 'Five pictures on panel, four of them horizontal, representing an auto da f� of the Inquisition, a procession of flagellants, a madhouse, a bullfight; another which is larger represents a masked festival; all painted in oil by the celebrated Court Painter don Francisco de Goya, and much praised by the Professors.'The history of these five paintings before they entered Garc�a de la Prada's collection is not known, now that they are no longer associated with the cabinet pictures made in 1793. They are now dated considerably later and the inclusion of the Inquisition scene suggests that they were probably painted after the suppression of the Inquisition in 1810, especially in view of the trouble Goya himself said he had with the Holy Office over Los Caprichos.

18393-1806grec.jpg	The New Testament mentions the apostle by name only, but says nothing of his acts. The Golden Legend tells of a missionary journey he made to India, and of his death in Armenia by being flayed alive.He is usually portrayed as dark-haired, bearded and of middle age. His invariable attribute is the knife with which he was flayed. Not uncommonly the flayed skin hangs over his arm, or is held in his hand, as in the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel (said to be a self-portrait of Michelangelo). His inscription, from the Apostles' Creed, is 'Credo in Spiritum Sanctum'. Typical narrative themes from Renaissance art show him preaching, exorcizing demons, baptizing, and being hauled before the authorities for refusing to worship idols. The most usual scene is the rather gruesome flaying. Artists sometimes follow the Hellenistic sculpture from Pergamum of the flaying of Marsyas

20035-port_boy.jpg	This portrait represents a young boy dressed in a brown coat with a blue waistcoat. It is a characteristic example of child portraiture, the genre in which Hone excelled. The young boy sits on a chair, one arm resting on its top as if he has been posed slightly against his will. This apparent reticence is, however, belied by his confident and expressive engagement directly with the painter whom he faces, and so with the viewer. The intimacy of the painting suggests that it is of a family member

40311-202turne.jpg	In the same Royal Academy exhibition as his Snow Storm, Turner showed a pair of pictures, Peace - Burial at Sea and War, the Exile and the Rock Limpet. The first is a haunting tribute to David Wilkie, who had died and been buried at sea off Gibraltar the previous year, on his way back from a visit to the Holy Land. The other, ostensibly of the exiled Napoleon on his island prison of St Helena, standing against a sky bloodshot as if with the carnage of his wartime campaigns, alluded to Wilkie's close friend Haydon. Haydon was famous both for his own pictures of Napoleon and for the egotism, paranoia and constant warfare with colleagues, critics and patrons that had by this time brought him to a state of professional exile.Peace is more than a farewell to a friend: it signals approval for the exemplary harmony in which Wilkie had lived. Its companion piece is a warning and a rebuke. It is characteristic of the painter's mental state - his basic belief was formed by deism - that the painting he called Peace depicts a burial: that of his famous fellow painter David Wilkie.

42836-06jerome.jpg	This altarpiece was painted for the church of Sant'Andrea della Zirada. Here the only figure present is the wonderfully monumental one of St Jerome, shown meditating on the Passion of Christ on the cross and simultaneously beating his breast with a stone. The saint is identified with great clarity by the presence of his symbols, a lion, cardinal's hat and books. The concept that the human being can only attain salvation by struggling fiercely with the weakness of the flesh through meditation and mortification, already evident in the behaviour of the saint, is underlined, at a deeper level of iconographic interpretation, by the harsh rocky landscape covered with wild scrub behind St Jerome, which would make it difficult to reach the flight of steps leading up to the plateau, occupied emblematically by a church and an obelisk, symbol of eternity.The painting is almost a figurative manual of late sixteenth-century asceticism. It illustrates distrust of self and faith in Christ, the exercise of penitence, and dedication to meditation and prayer

14353-artleers.jpg	Apart from paintings dealing with social customs and mores, there was a great demand from contemporary patrons of the arts for decorative canvases. An attractive example is provided by the large number of art gallery paintings, a specialism which arose in the 17th century, in which the patron is portrayed in the midst of his collection, and in which the artist expresses the ideas and attitudes of his time. Frans Francken II, who painted the Antwerp merchant Sebastiaan Leerse in his Gallery together with his second wife and their son, was a master in this field. Paintings of this kind have both aesthetic and documentary value, as the depicted paintings could largely be identified

37952-life_man.jpg	The painting shows an ordinary interior with ordinary people, in a straightforward way, not particularly embellished. Yet, in this deceptively natural painting a moral is hiding. This is not a scene casually glimpsed but the presentation of a scene; it is presented, literally, by drawing up a curtain. This drawn-up curtain has a special function: it calls the scene to the viewer's attention: 'now look at this.'What the viewer sees are people, young and old, male and female, drinking and playing and, above all, eating a lot of oysters. As oysters were a conventional aphrodisiac, they became a common sexual symbol - and their abundance gives this picture an unambiguous erotic meaning. But then, almost exactly where in the middle of the curtain is drawn up highest, a young boy is hiding in the attic, blowing bubble; a skull is next to him. The connotation of the skull is clear enough - and so to the contemporary audience, was the boy. He is the illustration of a classic adage: 'homo bulla' - 'man is a bubble.' The inclusion of this symbol of the insignificance of worldly pursuits unavoidably changes the meaning of this painting

His figures, whether few or large in number, or even in isolation, successfully play their part in his stories by expressing a mood, in this case the curiosity provoked by Christ's arrival in the Holy City.

Lorenzo was also active in Viterbo, painting the Mazzatosta Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria della Verit&#224; in 1465, a work which shows his closeness to the Paduan school of painting.In this picture, which comes from the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore at Cerveteri, the presence of a collaborator was detected in the less finely executed figure of Saint Michael. The two separate hands, as well as the cross added before the artist's signature suggest that the painter died before the canvas was complete. Besides the influence of the Ferrarese school and Mantegna, Lorenzo also looked towards Piero della Francesca, Benozzo Gozzoli and Melozzo da Forli.This painting is a fundamental work for the reconstruction of the career and artistic personality of its maker, an artist who demonstrates the variety of influences that was present in the school of Lazio in the fifteenth century"

18238-0508grec.jpg	Painted for the side altar on the Epistle side (right) of the church, and still in place. Probably painted 1578-79, following the completion of the High Altarpiece. The presence of Saint Ildefonso, the patron Saint of Toledo, was stipulated in the documents. Diego de Castilla, the Dean of Toledo Cathedral, is probably represented in this figure, which certainly is a portrait. The figure assists in setting an ideal plane for the enacting of the mystic event. El Greco has eliminated the intrusion of an incongruous space. The ground running parallel with the plane of the action produces no conflict. The rhythm of the passages of colour and light over the surface helps to hold together the composition, with its dramatic split revealing the figure of the Risen Christ. What suggestions remain of an ordinary conception of space, of corporeality and of a schematic quality of composition, disappear in his final version of the subject (painted in 1596-1600, now in the Prado, Madrid)

10134-14religi.jpg	The Virgin has settled down to rest in a meadow on the edge of a forest. Supported by her, the child Jesus reaches out for the strawberries which an angel is offering him. Another angel is drawing water from a spring, a third is bringing a bird, while others sit in the grass and make music. Joseph, holding his hat and staff, stands, as if on guard, behind the group.The representation of the Holy Family, who have interrupted their journey in a fresh summer landscape, has always been treated as a romantic theme. The poetic overtones of the incident may induce a sense of romanticism in the observer, but the significance of the details should not be overlooked. They are deeply rooted in the traditional symbolism of the Middle Ages. The strawberries, which the angel is offering the Child, were regarded as a divine fruit, and the exotic bird could also be taken as a symbol of paradise. The primrose in the meadow is a Marian symbol, as is the pure water gushing out of the spring. Two other plants, columbine and fumitory, should be noted in connection with the Virgin and Child. Fumitory had a special significance in folk tradition in the choice of bride and bridegroom. The symbolic identification of Jesus with the bridegroom is, of course, already known to us from the Bible (Matthew xxv). Only through an understanding of the symbolic imagery of the period can one appreciate why nature has lost its terrors as a scene of the flight and why the artist turned it into a heavenly garden, which alone seemed appropriate as a resting-place.What is surprising in Cranach's treatment of landscape is his creation of a magical fairy-tale atmosphere which marked an entirely new approach to nature in European painting. The artist, who was then thirty-two, had embarked upon a revolutionary course, which, in the context of the first five years of the sixteenth century, marks him out as the most advanced of German painters, apart from D�rer. The Berlin panel, the first painting known to bear the artist's signature, is commonly regarded as an early work; but only because we know practically nothing of his activities before 1500.Cranach, who came from Kronach in Franconia, was from 1505 onwards in the service of the Elector Frederick the Wise of Saxony at his court in Wittenberg. A painting as unusual as The Rest on the Flight, which was completed the previous year, may well have helped him to win so notable a position. The period in which the picture was painted coincides with a visit Cranach paid to Austria, of which little is known. He did, however, design a number of woodcuts for book illustrations and painted several portraits, among them, probably, one of the wife of the Viennese scholar Dr Reuss in 1503, now in the Berlin Gallery. The Rest on the Flight was clearly inspired by the Danube landscape, and it was this same region which inspired two other German landscape-painters who went much farther along the path Cranach had opened up: Albrecht Altdorfer and Wolf Huber

23357-15lucy2.jpg	The predella of the St Lucy Altarpiece was constituted by three panels, from left to right: St Lucy at the Tomb of St Agatha; St Lucy before Paschasius and St Lucy Harnessed to Oxen; Teams of Oxen. The altarpiece was commissioned from Lotto by the Confraternity of St Lucy in Iesi in 1523.The predella scenes reveal Lotto's talent as a painter of lively narrative scenes.The story of St Lucy begins in the left predella panel, in which the future saint, daughter of a noble family in Syracuse, visits the shrine of St Agatha with her mother Euthicia, who for four years has been suffering from an incurable issue of blood.  The two women kneel near an altar during the celebration of mass, during which the priest reads the passage from the gospel describing the miraculous cure by Jesus of the woman suffering from the same affliction as Euthicia. Euthicia prays at the shrine for a similar cure while Lucy, asleep, experiences a vision of St Agatha surrounded by angels. When she awakens, Lucy cures her mother, and begs to be released from her promise to marry, so that she can give away her dowry to the poor. The story in this panel closes with the women distributing alms to beggars in rag.The scene in the first predella panel is set in a Renaissance church, the architectural spaces of which provide distinct areas for the successive events. St Lucy is represented four times, she is identifiable by her yellow robe, red cloak, and laurel crown

31394-paolina3.jpg	"The seemingly plastic organization of the walls features bronze chiaroscuri framed in stone; round-headed niches flanked by columns, with ""living"" figures of the Virtues; overdoor paintings with female personifications; and pairs of putti holding bronze tondi. The plastic organization of the walls enters into competition with the fully plastic, partially gilded stucco of the ceiling and its colourful paintings.The six ceiling paintings and the large wall areas were reserved for scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, while the act of Apostle Paul - from his conversion to martyrdom - were depicted in the six tondi above the doors of the room. The selection of these two protagonists was clearly intended to play on the two names of the pope (Alessandro Farnese having become Paul III).Perino del Vaga painted just a part of the frescoes, the other parts being done by collaborators following his cartoons. Marco Pino from Siena, a student of Beccafumi, painted the six Alexander scenes on the vault:1. Alexander the Great before the High Priest2. Alexander the Great in the Temple of Jerusalem3.

31872-martyrdo.jpg	This painting was made for the Pucci Chapel in the Santissima Annunziata in Florence. It is approximately contemporary with Verrocchio's Baptism of Christ, with which it shares stylistic features. It is among the outstanding paintings of the entire Quattrocento. The physically convincing foreground figures, the decisive fashion in which they plant their feet on the ground, their sturdy bodies, massive forearms and hands, and the muscles under energetic stress are typical of Antonio, as is the carefully studied anatomical structure with the bodies shown in frozen action. Antonio is an enthusiastic observer of ancient art, as evidenced by his frequent utilization of figural poses and types borrowed from classical sculpture.Although the painting is often attributed solely to Antonio, there is reason to believe that his brother Piero played a role in its execution. (The archers who shoot at the saint from behind and large portions of the landscape probably belong to Piero.

03386-stillins.jpg	The art of Baschenis represents a peculiar chapter in the development of Italian still-life painting: through it the Bergamo School suddenly became famous, and since he had many followers and pupils, the genre of still-life painting with instruments became widely practiced. His large ceremonial compositions are his most characteristic and best works. The moderate and cheerful realism of his style was inspired by Caravaggio, but it remained free of the soul-searching dilemma encountered by the painters of seventeenth-century Rome, Naples and Florence. In his choice of themes and objects he was probably influenced by the world-famous instrument-making shop at nearby Cremona, which, for example, produced the beautiful lutes and violins of the Amati family.In Baschenis's paintings the instruments are the mediums of the Vanitas idea, and they are seldom coupled with the more expressive images of skulls, candles or books. In themselves a violin with its strings broken or a dusty lute are symbols of mortality. In this painting a single flower accentuates the meaning, and the presence of the globe makes it universally valid. Even the jewel-inlaid ebony writing desk is not merely decorative counterpoint in the red-gold-blue-green-brown harmony; rather it invokes the vanity of sciences as well. The two lutes laid down across each other and the violin rendered in side-view reveal the painter's excellent knowledge of the instruments' anatomy.

Shattered, the elevated waterway suggests a Titanic battle between the forces of humanity and nature, with the latter, as usual, the winner.

24977-castell1.jpg	The three panels depicting Sts Justus and Clement Praying for Deliverance from the Vandals (in Philadelphia), the Nativity (in London) and Sts Justus and Clement Multiplying the Grain of Volterra (in Philadelphia) come from an altarpiece once in the small parish church of Santi Giusto e Clemente in Faltugnano in the hills north of Prato, and now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Prato. They formed the predella of the altarpiece. The two panels in Philadelphia depict the legend of Justus and Clement.The two saints escaped the Goths in North Africa and settled in Volterra, which they helped save from the invading Vandals by having the grain remaining in the city multiplied and then thrown at the invaders, who dispersed in confusion. The saints were venerated throughout Tuscany, but by the mid-fifteenth century some doubts seem to have developed about their legend. Despite this, devotion to Justus and Clement was revived in Volterra when their relics were reinstalled in 1469

31136-6tortur1.jpg	At the end wall of the chapel, around the stain-glass window and below the prophets were placed the Burial of the Wood (on the left) and the Torture of the Jew (on the right). These two stories were painted by Piero's main assistant Giovanni da Piamonte, who used the cartoon by Piero.Having achieved his victory, Constantine determined to find out more about the mysterious cross. His mother, Empress Helena, set out for Jerusalem to learn what she could. There she questioned all of the Jewish scholars, and when she sensed that information was being withheld from her she threatened to have them all burned. At that a man by the name of Judas, who knew where the cross was to be found, was sent to her. He would not reveal the secret, however, so Helena had him thrown down into a dry well. After six days without food he begged to be released. We find this scene in the middle register of the choir wall. Judas has only halfway emerged from the well. One man holds him by the hair while two others pull him out with the help of a winch set up behind the well, from which a rope has been tied around his body

25132-virgin_m.jpg	The picture is of calm, monumental simplicity, a good painter's achievement demonstrating great skill; despite the few colours the picture does not look empty or poor. The abundance of whites brings into pleasing relief the Virgin's slender, green-clad figure giving a Gothic S-curve against the crimson curtain of the background; the mantle hanging from her shoulders serves as a beautiful symbol of patronage. The isolation of the scene from the background and consequently from the whole world, the very emphasis laid on the motive, are typical of the conservative tendencies of Cologne art which nevertheless welcomed the good opportunity for representing a piece of splendid Italian brocade. The heads deserve special notice; the tender glance of the Virgin and the sweet face of the Child, chiefly because the latter looks amazingly, precociously clever for his age.The looks of the Carmelite monks kneeling to the Virgin reflect clearly discernible intellectual activity. Most probably all the six figures are portraits, as suggested by the careful delineation of features mirroring fine shades of differences. The figure whose head is covered may have been the superior of the small company of friars; this assumption is supported by his distinguished position - in the immediate proximity, to the right of the Virgin Mary - as well as by his cap

36756-hermit.jpg	"The forest seclusion and the appealing life of the hermit, the quiet of the trees and the retreat into a simple life close to nature were the expression of a new attitude to life.

23360-15lucy5.jpg	The predella of the St Lucy Altarpiece was constituted by three panels, from left to right: St Lucy at the Tomb of St Agatha; St Lucy before Paschasius and St Lucy Harnessed to Oxen; Teams of Oxen. The altarpiece was commissioned from Lotto by the Confraternity of St Lucy in Iesi in 1523.The predella scenes reveal Lotto's talent as a painter of lively narrative scenes.The story moves back from the main panel to the predella where the right-hand section of the central predella panel unites with the right panel, with its atmospheric townscape, to form a single extended scene. Paschasius furiously orders her to dragged away by teams of oxen. Again the Holy Ghost (the white dove) intervenes on Lucy's behalf. The extension of this fourth scene across more than half of the width of the entire predella, represents a highly original approach to predella design.

44064-5crucifi.jpg	"Apart from some outstanding portraits, only a few paintings from Rogier's late period are extant. They include a problematical Lamentation (The Hague) containing many figures, and the great Crucifixion (Escorial) which, unlike the Lamentation, is remarkably well documented.The monumental Crucifixion, which at over three meters tall and almost two meters wide is the largest extant single panel by the artist, was given by Rogier himself to the Carthusian monastery of Scheut near Brussels in the last years of his life. Rogier had had connections with the Carthusians for some time, since his eldest son Corneille, whom he had enabled to study at the university of Leuven, had entered the Carthusian monastery of H�rinnes in the year 1448/49, and on that occasion Rogier and his wife had already made the monastery a handsome present of money and paintings. The monastery of Scheut, whose first prior came from H�rinnes, was not founded until 1456, and Rogier again donated money and paintings; in return, Mass was later said for his soul annually on the anniversary of his death.About a hundred years later, in 1555, the monks sold the painting, probably to Philip II of Spain, who took a great interest in Early Netherlandish painting, and had acquired Rogier's early Deposition (Prado, Madrid), among other works. Philip placed the painting in the Escorial, where it was severely damaged in a fire at the end of the 17th century.In this picture Rogier had returned to the concept of placing ""living"" figures in a painting where sculptures might be expected. In contrast to the Deposition, however, the scene is not set in an altar shrine. Rather, it is set in a shallow stone niche. This relates the picture to those monumental stone Crucifixion groups that can still be seen today in the interiors or exteriors of churches.The uniform ""stone-coloured"" garments emphasize this aspect, and at the same time suggest the white habits of the Carthusian order. The cloth of honour behind the figures both distinguishes them as saints and suggests the association with sculptures, which were often set off by real or painted cloths. Within the muted colouring of the panel, the intense bright red strikes a powerful note that heightens the emotional effect of the figures.Those figures are not readily comparable with the rest of Rogier's late works. The folds of the garments make a very harsh impression, at least in the picture's present poor state of preservation, the result of fire damage and subsequent restorations. The reason for the emphatic folds may lie in the reference to stone sculpture, but is more likely to have been for expressive purposes. The jagged shapes in front of the breast of St. John in particular, pointing sharply upward, seem in tune with his gestures and glance.St. John and the Virgin Mary here represent two complementary images of pain, one turned inward and the other outward. The motif of the Magdalene in the Deposition (Prado, Madrid) is used here for the Virgin Mary, but transformed into a more silent grief.The donation of the huge Crucifixion to Scheut, along with other items given by Rogier, meant a considerable expense of time and money. Rogier could afford it, as he could afford a number of charitable donations for the poor, and other gifts to churches in Brussels. In so far as we may conclude from the sparse source material, he had lived in prosperity since first coming to Brussels, and as a painter in great demand with a large workshop, he was obviously able to increase his fortune over a period of 30 years"

23381-04febo2.jpg	The portraits of Laura da Pola and Febo da Brescia belong to the period in his career when Lotto was particularly active as a portraitist. Both paintings are signed and dated 1544. They were identified by Berenson as works of Lotto from the artist's account book.Rather than painting monarchs and prelates, as did Titian, Lotto portrayed the local nobility, fixing their traits with an acute eye. There is no rhetorical decorative detail but only the existential truth of the subject.The handling of the paint, especially in the Portrait of Laura da Pola, is Titianesque in the brushwork, the broad and uneven strokes and the warm tonality. The register is kept predominantly low, however, and is almost monotonous in the costume and the background, except for the warm rays of the velvet chair and the explosive colour of the fan. The abstract oval of the face, framed by the regular coiffure and headdress, is reminiscent of the Tuscan tradition. Laura da Pola is shown with a pensive expression, emphasized by the refined rendering of the details of her attire

01106-portra_m.jpg	The genre of portraiture was one of the most important and most enduring new developments of the Quattrocento. This portrait is notable for its use of oils; Antonello da Messina was one of the few 15th-century Italian artists who fully mastered this technique (in contrast to Flemish artists, who used oils on a regular basis). Since oil paint dries much more slowly than tempera, it allows the artist more time to execute the work, and also enables the colours to be applied with much greater fluidity and flexibility

40003-1misc05.jpg	Of all his contemporaries, Degas undoubtedly has the greatest influence on Lautrec; both were interested in the same motifs, and subject to the same influences. There could be a trace of rivalry in Lautrec's picture After the Meal, which recalls Degas's Absinthe. In Degas's picture the compositional element - clearly showing Japanese influence - is more important than the content. Lautrec, by contrast, is not content to show a couple sitting at a tavern table, rather he reveals to us their characters and the situation in which they find themselves.The man is Lautrec's friend Maurice Guibert, and the woman is probably modelled on Suzanne Valadon. Guibert was an amateur painter and worked as a representative for the champagne company Mo&#235;t et Chandon

32956-10julius.jpg	The picture came to Florence from Urbino as one of the masterworks inherited by Vittoria della Rovere, wife of the Grand Duke Ferdinando II dei Medici since 1637 and descendant from the same family of the Pope Giulio II (1443-1513). The shape of this portrait is innovative as the figure is not presented just half-length but to the knees: to this kind of portrait shortly afterwards derived the State-portrait.An identical portrait now exhibited at the National Gallery of London raised a difficult question to establish which of them is the original painted by Raphael or the second version the artist's workshop probably executed under his supervision.

44783-immacula.jpg	The Immaculate Conception (in Spanish: Purisima) was a favourite subject in seventeenth-century Spanish painting. In these pictures Mary is usually represented as a child or as a young girl, her eyes turned heavenwards, personifying innocence and childlike devotion and rising amidst clouds and cherubs to heaven. Murillo painted innumerable versions of this theme, which also engaged the attention of Zurbar�n.This painting is a late work of Zurbar�n. The Virgin is a slender, delicate young girl with an exquisite oval face and golden hair falling to her shoulders, a vision in white and ultramarine seen against a golden sky peopled with cherubs. Though lacking in vigour, this late work has all the painterly qualities and expressive beauty of the great monumental paintings of Zurbar�n's early period.

09326-pitti3.jpg	The picture shows a view of the Udienza Privata, one of the adjoining three rooms on the ground floor in the summer quarters of Ferdinando II de' Medici in the Palazzo Pitti.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno) between 1637 and 1641. The adjoining three rooms of the summer suite were painted at the same time. The first two of them, the Udienza Pubblica and Udienza Privata, served as reception rooms, while the third and largest, which is directly accessible from the garden, was apparently used as an antechamber for visitors awaiting private audiences. These rooms were painted by Angelo Michele Colonna with the assistance of Agostino Mitelli with whom Colonna had established a highly efficient working relationship beginning in 1632.The pictorial program of the Udienza Privata, in the Ionic order, is devoted to Alexander the Great. Six scenes from his life appear in the form of simulated reliefs with applied gold on the columns intertwined with oak leaves, and the ceiling painting presents the Macedonian hero's apotheosis with furious pathos

31947-1poggio.jpg	Pontormo's early success was crowned by the official commissions he received from the Medici court. He took part in the decoration of the Salone of the Medicean Villa of Poggio a Caiano, a country villa at the foot of Montalbano much favoured by Lorenzo il Magnifico. He received the commission from Ottaviano de' Medici and Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, the future Clement VII. Andrea del Sarto and Franciabigio were also included in the project. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.The theme of the lunette fresco by Pontormo is traditionally described as Vertumnus and Pomona, the pictorial representation of the classical myth taken from a story in Ovid's Metamorphosis. This goes back to Vasari, who reported that Pontormo was asked to depict Vertumnus and some figures.However. Vasari's text is not a description of this fresco. Art historians have nevertheless tried to see Vertumnus and Pomona in the figures of the fresco. In the various attempts at interpretation thus far, each of the three male figures has been identified as Vertumnus, and each of the female ones as Pomona. It could be a possible explanation of the subject that the young woman at right in the upper part of the wall wearing a wreath of stalks of grain and various red flowers is Ceres, the goddess of agriculture, grain crops, fertility and motherly relationships. The naked youth on the left can be identified as Liber, the god of fertility (who had been identified with Bacchus since antiquity).The four figures at the lower part of the fresco represent the personifications of the Four Seasons, Winter, Autumn, Summer and Spring.This lunette was painted using only an almost frantic series of sketches as outline. The characters, unusually individualistic for such a work, are shown at various heights in front of a wall above which sprout long and slender fern-like shoots.Around the oculus of the window are four naked putti: the lower ones are holding the two ends of a festoon of leaves and fruits, while the two above are sitting on large trunks, from which slender laurel branches grow outwards, holding two standards aloft

33627-14sp1643.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 36.Rembrandt's extensive oeuvre has been calculated at around 600 works, of which 60 are self-portraits. From 1629 until his death he depicted himself at every stage of his career, looking at himself with honesty and a growing self-analysis, during periods both of prosperity and of economic and personal crisis. This self-portrait is dated around 1643, the year after the death of his wife Saskia, at a time when Rembrandt's clients began to dwindle in number, a situation which did not recover. The artist depicts himself with a serious and meditative expression, looking directly out at the viewer. Against a dark background and dressed in a black coat edged with fur, the light is concentrated on his face, which it models in soft chiaroscuro

19051-vault.jpg	Domenico Maria Canuti and Enrico Giovanni Haffner painted the ceiling of the church of Santi Domenico e Sisto in Rome, which was ceremoniously unveiled on Saint Dominic's Day (August 4) in the Holy Year 1675.The scene St Dominic in Glory was laid out in an essentially symmetrical way. The illusion of an opening is suggested by the increasing amount of light in the upper regions. Dominic stands on a golden disk borne by angels up to heaven, where Christ and the Virgin await him. The quadratura constitutes a striking modification of traditional Bolognese schemata, with the conventionally solid surround reduced to an undulant bordure that lends the ensemble a rhythmic quality, liberating rather than constricting the picture field and anticipating the style of the following century.

35247-1assumpt.jpg	Rosso's Assumption of the Virgin is found, along with works by Baldovinetti, Andrea del Sarto and Pontormo in the atrium of Santissima Annunziata.Given the notoriety of the works of Michelangelo and Raphael recently completed in Rome, it is Rosso Fiorentino's credit that he was an artist of extreme individuality and independence. The works of these artists, along with those of Leonardo, must have appeared so perfect on their own terms that it was imperative to either break with them or totally succumb to them. In this early painting, which has suffered from weathering, Rosso already expresses his own unconventional interpretations.Rosso's inventiveness is particularly clear in the upper section of the fresco portraying the Virgin rising to Heaven. He represented the Virgin ascending dramatically upwards into the golden firmament on lavender-coloured clouds with a chorus of angels at her feet. This daringly foreshortened, angled ring of naked children is surprisingly accomplished. Certain angels are seen in the same pose but shifted round, suggesting that Rosso painstakingly studied them first from purpose-made sculptural models in the studio

22526-1hereti.jpg	This fresco by Filippino Lippi and his assistant Raffaellino del Garbo, is part of the decoration of the Carafa Chapel of the Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome.The central scene of Aquinas confounding the heretics is inspired by the fourth book of Aquinas, the Summa contra Gentiles. Within an elaborate architectural stage is a central building with pilasters ornamented with torches, that was copied from an antique funerary monument. In the background are views of the Lateran and the Tiber. This may allude to Carafa's war against the Ottoman Turks, for he had departed from the Tiber to fight the Turks and when he returned to Rome, in January 1473, it was by Porta San Govanni.In the fresco, Aquinas is surrounded by four female figures, representing Philosophy, Astronomy, Theology, and Grammar. At the sides, in the foreground, are the defeated heretics, among which can be identified Arius, Apollinarius, and Averroes (on the left) and Sabellius, Euchites, and Manes (on the right), with the books thrown down on the ground before them.

41515-oratory.jpg	The Oratorio di San Giovanni Decollato in Rome houses the most important fresco cycle executed in the difficult decades after he Sack of Rome. It was commissioned by the Florentine confraternity of the Misericordia, founded in 1488, whose members had set themselves the task of helping those sentenced to death by providing them with spiritual support. Shortly after its founding the confraternity began the construction of the church and oratory next door. The completion of the church was delayed until 1553. By around 1536, on the other hand, the oratory had been completed to the extent that the painted decoration of the room could begin.The subject chosen for the fresco cycle, which covers the upper half of all four walls, was the story of the patron saint of the brotherhood, John the Baptist. For the execution of the cycle they selected Florentine (or Tuscan) artists working in Rome at the time. The most renowned Florentine painter active in Rome was Perino del Vaga, and several preparatory drawings for the frescoes by him have been preserved. Perino's designs were executed by younger Florentine artists, Jacopino del Conte and Cecchino (Francesco) del Salviati.The fresco cycle was completed on the left wall in 1553 with the Beheading of St John the Baptist. This was carried out by an assistant who reused some of Salviati's older drawings for several figures but whose overall composition did not come close to approximating the achievements of his master

19839-07erasmu.jpg	"Born in Rotterdam in 1469, Desiderius Erasmus was the greatest European scholar of the 16th century. Using the philological methods pioneered by Italian humanists, he helped lay the groundwork for the historical-critical study of the past, especially in his studies of the Greek New Testament and the Church Fathers. His educational writings contributed to the replacement of the older scholastic curriculum by the new humanist emphasis on the classics. By criticizing ecclesiastical abuses, while pointing to a better age in the distant past, he encouraged the growing urge for reform, which found expression both in the Protestant Reformation and in the Catholic Counter-Reformation. Finally, his independent stance in an age of fierce confessional controversy - rejecting both Luther's doctrine of predestination and the powers that were claimed for the papacy - made him a target of suspicion for loyal partisans on both sides and a beacon for those who valued liberty more than orthodoxy.The painting shows Erasmus writing the first lines of his ""Comments on the Gospel of St Luke"" dated 1523. The lines are not legible on this painting but it is legible on another smaller version of the portrait in the museum of Basel.As in the Basel portrait, Holbein here depicts Erasmus as the learned author actively pursuing his vocation as a writer - his gaze is lowered and he focuses entirely on the text he is writing. Even though the scholar's study chambers is not shown, the tapestry with its pattern of plants and fabulous beasts and the wooden paneling explicitly indicate, unlike the background of the Basel version, that this is an interior.Holbein's greatness is demonstrated in this fine portrait not only in its technical mastery but also in its comprehension and presentation of the salient features of the subject's personality and activity. The scale of Erasmus' bulk within the picture space is prodigious; previously, scholars had been portrayed in book-lined studies, surrounded by the tools of their trade, musing as does Saint Jerome in D�rer's woodcut of 1514, complete with shaggy lion. (Erasmus himself edited Saint Jerome's works, thus identifying with the patron saint of translators.) Saint Augustine was also popularly depicted in a monastic study, as in Carpaccio's appealing image of 1505.Holbein's treatment is more intimate; to be able to look over the scholar's shoulder at the pen poised on the paper (engaged on the Paraphrase of Saint Mark) is an honour the nervous Erasmus would have granted only to intellectual equals. It has been concluded that Sir Thomas More was the intended recipient of this version: Erasmus was usually posed in a more formal three-quarter view. Such portraits were often exchanged by humanists as tokens of mutual esteem, which explains the considerable number of painted and engraved copies in existence; aspiring scholars would use these to adorn their studies as encouragement to their emulatory efforts.Erasmus lived through writing and above all, by correspondence; ironically, in 1533 he was to censure Holbein for delaying in Antwerp which was preventing Erasmus' mail being delivered (Holbein being the bearer). Here, as in other portraits of him, we see the great master of North European humanism in his self appointed role as educational conscience of the age.In the Web Gallery of Art you can view several portraits of Erasmus by Renaissance painters, such as Hans Holbein the Younger, Albrecht D�rer and Quentin Massys"

25102-4lamenta.jpg	The composition is well known and goes back to Hugo van der Goes. Of this original Lamentation, which was painted on canvas, only a small fragment has survived which is now in Christ Church, Oxford. The composition was copied on numerous occasions, especially in the sixteenth century and even in the seventeenth, mostly in an impersonal and technically weak style. An exception to this is the high-quality drawing (Vienna, Albertina) convincingly ascribed to Pieter Bruegel. The Bruges version is all but unknown.In fact this version is in many respects a revelation. It not only belongs because of its quality, colour scheme and technique to another, still fifteenth-century painting tradition, but it differs radically from the aforementioned series of copies by its personal interpretation of the model. The unreal golden background has been replaced by a vivid landscape with in the middle ground to the right a group of rocks and a road leading to a fortified city in the distance. This city, set against a blue strip of horizon, must, judging by the round temple building, represent Jerusalem (there is a certain resemblance to Bruges' Jerusalem Church). The figures are sculpturally modelled and have typically oriental eyes. The brightly coloured fabrics have rather hard folds with a metallic gloss. A particular characteristic is the way in which the blue of the Virgin's mantle resembles the density of material by the use of a stipple technique. All this quite definitely points to the Bruges Master of the Legend of St Lucy, which is technically confirmed by the unusual construction of the panel. The work must date from the end of the fifteenth century

40739-07icon.jpg	St Menas is Egypt's most important saint. He is said to have been born there, served as a soldier in the Roman army, and to have acknowledged his faith in Phrygia during the persecution of Christians under Diocletian, being beheaded in consequence. But the numerous witnesses to his life, martyrdom and miracles, which have been handed down in many languages, are contradictory.In the early iconography Menas is not depicted and venerated as a warrior saint, but as a martyr, to whom healing powers were ascribed. The first representations of the saint armed and in soldier's armour can be found at the end of the thirteenth century. Depictions of St Menas on horseback were however unusual throughout the whole Byzantine era, and even in post-Byzantine times, i.e. from the 15th century he is only very seldom depicted thus.This very high-quality picture of a saint was probably painted for an aristocratic patron, as an icon of his own patron saint, by one of the best Cretan icon-painters of his day

26078-23virgin.jpg	This small, intimate painting has sometimes been viewed unjustly as a possible workshop piece or described as having been marred by restoration. It is, on the contrary, an exquisite work which, though damaged in places, with its finely painted city view on the left, is still of extraordinary quality.This is one of the variants in the series of Virgins accompanied by one or more angels that proved to be such a successful part of Memling's oeuvre. The Child's pose is the typological match of the Virgin Enthroned in Berlin, with both examples deriving from a prototype of Rogier van der Weyden. The angels hold musical instruments - a partially hidden lute on the left, and a fiddle on the right. Their albs and wings are painted in refined hues, in Memling's characteristic fashion: the angel on the left in white with grey wings, and the one on the right with a delicate lilac sheen and light purple wings, blending into yellow around the edges. The Virgin sits in a small, enclosed garden, as in the Munich diptych, before a hedge of white and red roses, with a white lily in their midst. The Marian symbolism of this is clear, as is the fact that the spot is sealed off from the remainder of the landscape by a reinforced wall to the rear. Mary is allegorically represented as a fortress.The little work must have been executed in the 1480s, given its stylistic similarities with the Diptych of Jean du Cellier

40393-5dragon2.jpg	The majority of art historians attribute to Paolo Uccello the two small paintings of St George and the Dragon (National Gallery, London and Mus�e Jacquemart-Andr�, Paris). The London picture was probaly painted around 1456 and the Paris one shortly afterwards, not later than 1460. They confirm Paolo's talent in small-scale works and his ability as a lively and imaginative storyteller.

39201-hounds.jpg	At the left background a hunting scene is visible.Dog portraiture began in France at the court of Louis XV, who commissioned portraits of his favourite houndshunting scenes of Frans Snyders. In England, where the emphasis in hunting was increasingly being placed upon the performance of individual hounds, which led to intense rivalry among the landed elite, this was reflected in the paintings of John Wootton and Peter Tillemans; the former of whom in particular started to produce portraits of dogs in the mid eighteenth century. Fine examples of Wootton's work in this manner include the mock heroic portrait of Horace Walpole&#146;s favourite dog Patapan, painted in 1743. However, it was Stubbs, a generation later, who really developed the genre, working, as he was, at a time when dogs were becoming increasingly valued not only as sporting trophies, but as objects of interest in themselves. By the late eighteenth century, the dog had gained a new status as a prized possession within English households which it had not formerly enjoyed. Stubbs's highly sensitive paintings of these animals are executed with infinite attention to detail and are possessed with boundless character and charm. Whilst they are seldom uninteresting as paintings, at their best they are small masterpieces

02743-scene.jpg	The picture shows a view of the long south wall with scenes 6-10 of the St Cecilia cycle. Above the entrance on the west wall is the balcony which abuts the Bentivoglio family chapel in the adjacent church of San Giacomo Maggiore.St Cecilia is one of the most famous Roman saints, although she is purely legendary. She is meant to have lived in the second or more probably the third century, but only appears in the tradition in the fifth and sixth centuries. A young girl of noble background, she was betrothed, in spite  of her vow of chastity, to a noble Roman, Valerius. After the apparition of an angel in the marriage chamber, she converted the young man to Christianity and persuaded both him and his brother, Tibertius, to receive baptism. She then refused to make an offering to the pagan gods and was condemned to be suffocated in a boiler, but was saved by the descent of a refreshing cloud from the sky. She was then taken to be beheaded, but the executioner, even after three violent blows, could not detach her head. She lingered on, mutilated, for three days before expiring.The fresco cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia consists of ten scenes from the legend of Saints Cecilia and Valerian, located on the north (scenes 1-5) and south (scenes 6-10) walls of the Oratory, which is connected by a passageway to the church of San Domenico Maggiore. The cycle, resembling a continuous frieze, is very different from the sort of painting normally found in parish churches. It bears a greater resemblance to the suites of canvases produced for Venetian oratories and assembly rooms.The ten horizontal panels, each filled with life-size figures in the foreground, create the impression of a continuous pictorial narrative, one that is structured but not actually interrupted by the framing pilasters. The continuous background landscapes incorporate scenes from the legend of St Cecilia, a large part of which involves the conversions and martyrdoms of her husband Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. Also depicted are the Roman official Maximus, another convert, and Pope Urban I as the saints' protectors, who are soon afterward martyred themselves.The predominant character of the cycle completely reflects the styles of the two masters who set the tone for the Bolognese school in around 1500, namely Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia. They must be regarded as the ones who devised the St Cecilia cycle, which was ultimately realized by collaborators whose names can no longer be determined with the exception of two panels with the signature of Amico Aspertini. The fact that the first pictures on each wall are by Francia would indicate that he was the supervisor of the project.Three pairs of scenes were executed by Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and Amico Aspertini. The author of the two other pairs are not known, here we present the reproductions of these scenes among the works by Francesco Francia.  The scenes of the cycle are the following:Scene 1: Marriage of Cecilia and Valerian (Francesco Francia)Scene 2: Valerian with Pope Urban (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 3: Valerian is Baptized (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 4: Coronation of Cecilia and Valerian (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 5: Martyrdom of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 6: Burial of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 7: Cecilia Disputing with Almachius (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 8: Martyrdom of St Cecilia (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 9: Cecilia Gives away Her Possessions (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 10: Burial of St Cecilia (Francesco Francia

14651-01baronc.jpg	The Baroncelli Chapel was added to the south end of the transept of the Santa Croce in the fourteenth century. The construction on the chapel began in February 1328 and the donors were five members of the Baroncelli family. The decoration of the chapel was executed by Taddeo Gaddi between 1328 and 1333. The chapel is consecrated to the Annunciation to the Virgin, and thus the pictorial program is devoted to the life of the Virgin.The fresco cycle covers only the two walls of the front section of the space, beginning on the east wall (at the left in this picture). On the south wall are the Annunciation to the Virgin, the Visitation, the Annunciation to the Shepherds, the Birth of Christ, the Christ Child Appears to the Magi as a Star, and the Adoration of the Magi.On the pilaster dividing the two parts of the room are Isaiah above and a youthful David as the conqueror of Goliath below.

07585-53mercy.jpg	From the fiefs of the Colonna family Caravaggio took refuge in Naples, in 1606. There he began to work again with his usual, astounding speed. Early in January 1607 he was paid for the immense altarpiece commissioned to him by the Pio Monte di Misericordia (where it may still be seen today). The painting shows the Seven Acts of Mercy. It is very complicated in its organization. Caravaggio actually had to add a series of figures (two angels and the Madonna and Child, the latter painted later) in the upper part of the painting, which make the composition of the picture the most complex, perhaps, in any of his works. Caravaggio did not paint exemplary episodes intended to stir the viewer to religious piety through the illustrative emphasis of gestures and feelings. Rather, he entrusted the educational effectiveness of his works to the evidence of things in themselves, in the conviction that nothing should be added above and beyond what is already contained in the intrinsic eloquence of the various poses.The seven acts of mercy represented on the painting are the following. On the right appear the (1) burial of the dead and the episode of the so-called Carita Romana (Cimon's daughter giving her father suck in prison), which contains at once the two charitable acts of (2) visiting prisoners and (3) feeding the hungry. (4) Dressing the naked appears in the foreground, symbolized by St. Martin and the beggar. Next to this scene, the host and St. James of Compostela allude to the (5) offering of hospitality to pilgrims. (6) Relieving the thirsty is represented by Samson drinking from the ox jaw. The youth on the ground behind the beggar of St. Martin may also represent the merciful gesture of (7) caring for the sick.We readily apprehend the artist's power of synthesis, which concentrates a conceptual content that is potentially quite dispersive, in the model behavior of a few figures.

17121-arles43.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 463, JH 1575.In the 1880s, gas lamps had spread as far as the provinces in France. The theme of artificial lighting was quickly dealt with in van Gogh's famous masterpiece, The Night Caf� in the Place Lamartine in Arles. In this painting the figures huddled at the tables have a lost air, and empty glasses bear witness to the excesses of alcoholism. But by the rear wall sits a couple locked in an embrace; in fact the background affords a fair amount of comfort, with a bunch of whitish flowers and a curtained doorway opening into a bright, cheerful room. Still, van Gogh insists on seeing the composition in negative terms. It is the lamps alone that highlight the dismal, wretched hopelessness of the atmosphere. Their glaring brightness mercilessly exposes what subdued candlelight would allow to remain hidden. The steady, impersonal light renders everything pitilessly and coldly anonymous

29869-virtue1.jpg	"The triptych, which was very likely commissioned by Margaret of Austria, the governor of the Low Countries, depicts two biblical episodes illustrating the virtues of patience: the Book of Job and the parable of Lazarus the beggar and the rich man. Since the Middle Ages it had been common practice to draw a parallel between the resignation of Job and of Lazarus in the face of misfortune and the constancy of their faith in God.When closed, the triptych depicts the parable of Lazarus. At the bottom of the wings, divided into three symmetrical registers, Lazarus is dying at the rich man's gate, whilst the latter suffers eternal torment. The Italianate pose, and the monumentality and beauty of the nude are inspired by Raphael. In the centre, the rich man's feast, followed by his agony, take place in a sumptuous mansion. His wife, bringing him communion, and the physician, examining his urine, are looking after him whilst, in hell, two demons are torturing him, presenting him with a chalice writhing with serpents and a bowl filled with an infernal liquid. At the top, Lazarus' soul rises up to heaven in the form of a child, first held up by two angels in a transparent bubble, then in the bosom of Abraham.Van Orley creates his masterpiece by marrying the Flemish tradition with the new directions of Italian art and his own inventiveness. The result is a veritable profession of faith in the Renaissance, underlined by the artist's motto, ""Elx syne tyt"" (each in his time) inscribed on the pillar to the left of the central panel"

34156-hughes.jpg	Joshua Reynolds, the most important painter in England in the eighteenth century, was the first President of the Royal Academy on its foundation in 1768 and was knighted the following year. Utilizing the pictorial teachings of the past, the compositional principles of Baroque art and the colouring of the Venetian painters of the Renaissance, he became the foremost portrait painter of his time. The members of the English aristocracy and the wealthy middle classes who commissioned him usually expected him, as their official painter, to produce dignified and flattering likenesses, and indeed, by lavish use of external trappings and a truly brilliant capacity for selecting the most becoming pose, he was able to do what was required of him. But he could penetrate beneath the elegant surface and had the power to suggest character and individuality without marring the pleasing overall picture.Plump, serene and ruddy of face, with an evident partiality for good food and drink, there is something reminiscent of Falstaff in the portrait of Admiral Hughes now in Budapest. The fiery garnet tint of the coat and the gold of the braid and the order on the sitter's breast create a brilliant harmony which marvelously demonstrates the principal virtue of Reynolds's art: his glowing colour. The picture was painted in 1786 and, according to Reynolds's notes, became the property of the Imperial Ambassador in 1787. This Imperial Ambassador was none other than Prince Esterh�zy, and the picture was acquired by the Museum as part of the Esterh�zy collection. There is another version in the Painted Hall at Greenwich

08945-allegory.jpg	The Allegory of the 1577 peace in the Low Countries, painted by Pieter Claeissens the Younger, is a complex, symbolic scene with a Roman triumphal chariot. Such vehicles often carried victorious, allegorical figures in propaganda pieces of this kind. Here we find Peace, Reconciliation and Unity. The painting was commissioned for the Bruges Town Hall on the occasion of the Pacification of Ghent and symbolizes the peace between the Catholic and Protestant provinces.

33970-cleopat2.jpg	The circumstances of the commission of this painting are slightly unusual. According to the Bolognese connoisseur, Malvasia, the painting was one of four half-length figures undertaken in a competitive spirit for the Venetian merchant Boselli by Palma Giovane, Niccol&#242; Renieri, Guercino and Guido Reni. Palma Giovane seems to have acted as the intermediary in the negotiations and, since he died in 1628, it can be deduced that the related paintings date from towards the close of the 1620s or the early 1630s. After Boselli's death, the Cleopatra passed into the collection of Renieri and shortly afterwards into that of Domenico Fontana. Several copies are known.The subject of Cleopatra with the asp was popular during the seventeenth century and Reni evolved a number of half- and three-quarter-length interpretations. The sequence begins with the depiction of a more regal Cleopatra in Potsdam (Sanssouci), dating from about 1625-26, continues with the present painting, and is developed in those in Florence (Palazzo Pitti), London (private collection) and Rome (Capitoline Museum), all of which date from the late 1630s or early 1640s. A three-quarter-length composition was again chosen by the artist for his treatment of Lucretia and the Magdalen.In this Cleopatra Reni demonstrates his skill as a draughtsman in the foreshortening of the head seen from below, and his competence as a designer in his use of diagonals. There is also an abundance of skill in the portrayal of the expression, the modelling of the flesh, the swathes of drapery, and the use of fresh, light colours - pink and white - set against a dark background. All these elements are components of the classicism associated with the followers of Annibale Carracci, of which Reni was a leading exponent. It was a style for which he was universally admired both during his own time and in the eighteenth century, at the end of which his reputation waned. Reni's art was appreciated for its grace and finesse, the result of sound jjudgment and flowing brushwork.The subject is taken from the Lives of the Caesars by Plutarch, in which Cleopatra's suicide in 30 BC is described. Following Mark Antony's defeat by Octavian at the Battle of Actium, an asp was smuggled in to Cleopatra in a basket of figs. Her death resulted from its bite. Mark Antony also committed suicide

34242-l_horses.jpg	If Sebastiano Ricci can be called the father of Venetian Rococo, his nephew and collaborator, Marco, was the initiator of the new genre of landscape painting. Influenced by the examples of the Neapolitan landscape painters Mirco Spadaro and Salvator Rosa, by Claude Lorrain and by the Roman Viviano Codazzi, and inspired by loving observation of the natural setting of hills and valleys around his native Belluno, Ricci developed a romantic and heroic style of painting, which derives almost certainly from a familiarity with the drawings of Titian, the engravings of Domenico Campagnola, the works of Dutch and Flemish masters (seen during his stay in London 1708-10), with the imaginative works of Carlevaris and romantic drama of Alessandro Magnasco. Such eclecticism gives rise nevertheless to a faithful observation of nature, characterized by a breadth of atmosphere and a fluid light. This landscape is fine example of his skilful use of light to create intensely real effects. In the wide vistas given unity by Ricci's handling of atmosphere, the observation of detail has a refreshing naturalness and truth

29230-1reale.jpg	During his fifty-year reign (1680-1730) Vittorio Amadeo II transformed Turin, the second royal residence on Italian soil after Naples, into one of the most splendid Baroque cities in Europe. In 1584 he started the enlargement of the palace known as the Palazzo Reale. The additions to the palace were patterned after the models of French court architecture, but for the wall decorations he looked for Italian painters. The decoration continued under the reign of Carlo Emanuele III (1730-1773). In addition to painters from Rome and Venice, Neapolitan painters also made a significant contribution to the decoration.Francesco de Mura within a period of roughly eighteen months (1741-43) painted five ceilings in the king's summer apartment, part of which occupied the north wing. His subjects were taken from Greek mythology, and four of these ceilings have survived in what was subsequently turned into an archive. One of these ceilings depicts the Legend of Theseus

12496-10tucher.jpg	The panel is the right side of a diptych that includes the portrait of her husband Hans. Inscription in the top right, by someone else(?): FELITZ. HANS. TUCHERIN, 33 JOR. ALT. SALUS. In 1824, the two portraits were included in the inventory of the museum in the J&#228;gerhaus of Weimar. After 1918, they were passed from the grand dukes to the museum.It was commissioned in the same year as the diptych of Nicolas and Elsbeth Tucher (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kassel). They had approximately the same composition because Wolgemut, D�rer's master, had already done portraits of the members of the Tucher family years before. Even the setting of the portraits is very similar. The presence of an embroidered curtain in the background, the almost identical landscape passage seen through the windows, and lastly, the windowsill set equal spatial limits to the portraits. The foreshortenings of the landscape passage are imaginative and mannered, showing roads, lakes, and mountains. On the road, in the landscape behind the man's portrait, one discerns a wayfarer; on the path, in the woman's portrait, a man on horseback. The same clouds are seen in the clear sky behind the man, as in the wife's portrait, and in Elsbeth Tucher's.Felicitas holds a carnation, with a bud and a flower. Her plump face is turned to the left, but her gaze, with slightly melancholic eyes, looks to the right. Like her sister-in-law, she wears a gold chain around her neck, and the waistcoat, according to custom, is held by a buckle , which is engraved with the initials of her consort, H. T

37253-50child.jpg	To the left of the Meditation is the fresco of the Miracle of the Resurrected Child; like the Miraculous Mass, this episode had never been included in a fresco cycle before. While Martin is praying he is approached by a woman holding her dead child in her arms; she begs him to do something and the Saint kneels in prayer. Amidst the astonishment of those present the child is resurrected.It was pointed out that Simone does not follow the official biographies (which all report the incident as having taken place in the countryside around Chartres), but blends this event with a legend that was popular in Siena at the time. This legend was a longstanding oral tradition, which we know of from a 1657 source; it tells the story of Martin stopping in Siena while on his way to Rome on a pilgrimage. In Siena he performed a miracle so great that a church consecrated to him was built in the city. The miracle was a resurrection and this is the connection that justifies Simone's blending of the two episodes and changing the setting to Siena. The city centre is symbolized by the building to the right: the square-topped battlements, the three-light mullioned windows on the piano nobile and the Sienese arch above the entrance door help us identify it as the Palazzo Pubblico. This is how the town hall appeared before 1325 when the bell tower, the Torre del Mangia, was added to the left.The need to make the event recounted more immediate, to modernize an episode that had occurred almost a thousand years before, made Simone go even further. The crowd does not consist only of pagans, as the written accounts of the event described it; Simone portrays a most varied group of onlookers. A plump friar is shown looking up at a tree above the scene: he looks very much like Gentile da Montefiore. Some of the figures are praying devoutly, while others, such as the knight in the blue hat, express astonishment and even scepticism (notice how the other knight looks at him frowning, as though in reproach)

38386-brittany.jpg	The reception of Impressionism in Canada began about a decade later than in the US in the 1890s. Though the fashion for Canadian artists after 1890 was to study in Paris at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts or the leading private academies, it was rare for them to grapple with the technique of Impressionism. When they did, it was either a case of direct imitation of the French model, as with Helen McNicoll, or - and this applied to the majority - of briefly adopting a style as a transition to other approaches.

He had already depicted an un realized scheme for the Rialto Bridge, but in these works went one stage further and painted alternatives to the actual bridge surrounded by a sophisticated and extensive group of invented buildings.While the bridge and the buildings appearing on the companion piece are almost entirely imaginary, in this picture it is possible to locate the origin of a number of the buildings.

26090-25more2.jpg	The triptych is primarily dedicated to the three saints portrayed in the central panel. St Christopher stands in the middle, the Christ Child on his shoulders, having just crossed the river. The flowering staff is his customary attribute. The hermit who lights up the riverbank from a cave is also a recurring element in Christopher's legend. The two other saints, who do not belong to the same story but who are included in the landscape to preserve the unity of the composition, stand on opposite banks. The figure on the left (St Maurus) is a monk holding a crook and an open book, while the one on the right is St Giles, with the hind and an arrow piercing his arm.St Maurus and St Giles were probably selected on the basis of the surnames Moreel and Hertsvelde. `Maurus' and `Moreel' share the same etymology (`Maurus' = `Moor' - the Moreel coat-of arms includes Moors' heads) and the hind (`hert') of St Giles can be linked to the name of Hertsvelde. The same saints appear in an illuminated Book of Hours that belonged to the couple. The forenames and surnames of the donors are thus represented by the linkage of the patron saints in the wings with the saints depicted alongside them in the central panel.St Christopher was invoked against sudden death. It was believed that whoever looked upon him would not die that same day without benefit of the last sacraments. This might be one reason for his highly unusual selection as the principal figure of a major altarpiece. St Christopher's head might have been inspired by that of Longinus in the right wing of the Master of Fl�malle's Passion altarpiece, which was to be found in St James' Church at that time. A spring rises from the rocks on the far right, next to St Giles. This symbolises the proclamation of the Good News to refresh the faithful, and is thus a direct allusion to the presence of the Christ Child

43590-8jerome.jpg	Simon Vouet was the most versatile of all the French painters in Rome in the 1620s. His earliest pictures are the closest to those of Caravaggio, but his art lacked almost all Caravaggio's sense of drama. Instead, he concentrated on flashy and facile effects, which were, of course, to stand him in good stead at the court of Louis XIII, where he was to become the first French painter to be able to understand and interpret the Italian Baroque. He was good at lighting effects and sharp contrasts of colour. An example of this is the St Jerome and the Angel. This painting is devoid of the drama which marks Caravaggio's St Matthew and the Angel, Vouet relied much more on his technique of strong lighting and bold brushwork, and was never interested in penetrating the essence of his subject-matter.Executed during Vouet's long sojourn in Rome, St Jerome and the Angel, with its extreme contrasts of light and dark, bare interior setting, and three-quarter-length format, has been recognized as one of Vouet's most Caravaggesque works. Vouet's angel, a tousled urchin encumbered by voluminous robes, is an insistently robust, physical presence in the tradition of Caravaggio. The obvious comparison with Caravaggio's first version of the Inspiration of St Matthew for the Contarelli Chapel and his St Jerome Writing demonstrate both Vouet's debt to Caravaggio and his independence from the older artist

20798-polypty1.jpg	Juan de Flandes was trained in the Ghent-Bruges school, and very little is known about him. The only indications of his early life are his style as a painter and the generic name given him in Spain. Even his twenty-three years in Castile are sparsely documented and known mostly through contracts and official records. He is first recorded in the payrolls of Isabella's servants in 1496, and stayed on at court until her death eight years later. Little remains of this period of activity, except for the altarpiece of St John the Baptist, executed for the Charterhouse of Miraflores (surviving panels are in the Museum van der Bergh, Antwerp, Museum of Art, Cleveland, Mus�e d'art et d'histoire, Geneva and private collection) and part of the magnificent work of art known as the Polyptych of Isabella the Catholic. This polyptych originally comprised forty-seven small panels (each measuring about 21 x 16 centimetres). Approximately twenty-seven survive, of which two were executed by Michel Sittow.The Temptation of Christ, one of the surviving panels of the polyptych, reveals Juan de Flandes's origin in the art of Hugo van der Goes and his follower the Master of Mary Burgundy, whose precise, delicate style of miniature painting he adapted to works in oil on panel

20438-triptych.jpg	The Triptych was painted between 1415 and 1436 with the earlier of the two dates the more probable given the affinity of this work with the style of the 'Stories of Santa Lucia' in the Pinacoteca at Fermo. If the appearance of the lateral saints - St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist - is still somewhat forbidding, and if they seem still to be firmly part of the world of the 1300s, the centre is occupied by the Virgin presented as an extremely elegant, divine idol, surrounded by crowds of devotees, the costume and physical attitude of each of which is rendered through an extremely subtle use of light and colour

07504-23conta.jpg	"This painting is the pendant to the Martyrdom of St Matthew and hanging opposite in the Contarelli Chapel of the San Luigi dei Francesi, the French Church in Rome. It was particularly appropriate to both the place and the time, for Rome's French community had something to celebrate: Henri IV, heir to St Louis, had recently converted to the faith of his ancestors.The subject traditionally was represented either indoors or out; sometimes Saint Matthew is shown inside a building, with Christ outside (following the Biblical text) summoning him through a window. Both before and after Caravaggio the subject was often used as a pretext for anecdotal genre paintings. Caravaggio may well have been familiar with earlier Netherlandish paintings of money lenders or of gamblers seated around a table like Saint Matthew and his associates.Caravaggio represented the event as a nearly silent, dramatic narrative. The sequence of actions before and after this moment can be easily and convincingly re-created. The tax-gatherer Levi (Saint Matthew's name before he became the apostle) was seated at a table with his four assistants, counting the day's proceeds, the group lighted from a source at the upper right of the painting. Christ, His eyes veiled, with His halo the only hint of divinity, enters with Saint Peter. A gesture of His right hand, all the more powerful and compelling because of its languor, summons Levi. Surprised by the intrusion and perhaps dazzled by the sudden light from the just-opened door, Levi draws back and gestures toward himself with his left hand as if to say, ""Who, me?"", his right hand remaining on the coin he had been counting before Christ's entrance.The two figures on the left, derived from a 1545 Hans Holbein print representing gamblers unaware of the appearance of Death, are so concerned with counting the money that they do not even notice Christ's arrival; symbolically their inattention to Christ deprives them of the opportunity He offers for eternal life, and condemns them to death. The two boys in the center do respond, the younger one drawing back against Levi as if seeking his protection, the swaggering older one, who is armed, leaning forward a little menacingly. Saint Peter gestures firmly with his hand to calm his potential resistance. The dramatic point of the picture is that for this moment, no one does anything. Christ's appearance is so unexpected and His gesture so commanding as to suspend action for a shocked instant, before reaction can take place. In another second, Levi will rise up and follow Christ_in fact, Christ's feet are already turned as if to leave the room. The particular power of the picture is in this cessation of action. It utilizes the fundamentally static medium of painting to convey characteristic human indecision after a challenge or command and before reaction.The picture is divided into two parts. The standing figures on the right form a vertical rectangle; those gathered around the table on the left a horizontal block. The costumes reinforce the contrast. Levi and his subordinates, who are involved in affairs of this world, are dressed in a contemporary mode, while the barefoot Christ and Saint Peter, who summon Levi to another life and world, appear in timeless cloaks. The two groups are also separated by a void, bridged literally and symbolically by Christ's hand. This hand, like Adam's in Michelangelo's Creation, unifies the two parts formally and psychologically. Underlying the shallow stage-like space of the picture is a grid pattern of verticals and horizontals, which knit it together structurally.The light has been no less carefully manipulated: the visible window covered with oilskin, very likely to provide diffused light in the painter's studio; the upper light, to illuminate Saint Matthew's face and the seated group; and the light behind Christ and Saint Peter, introduced only with them. It may be that this third source of light is intended as miraculous. Otherwise, why does Saint Peter cast no shadow on the defensive youth facing him "

08266-centurio.jpg	"Scholars agree on attributing this painting to Cavallino, and date it to between 1645 and 1650 on account of the studied poses, the academicizing tendencies and the visible influence of the German painter Schoenfeld, active in Naples from 1638 to 1648. On the basis of the identification of the standing young man to the right as the artist's self portrait, a dating to the end of the 1640's was also proposed. This dating is compatible with the apparent age of the ""self-portrait"", as Cavallino would have been just over thirty years old at that time. Such an inclusion is consistent with what we know about Cavallino, who included images of himself in eight of his paintings.According to the sources, Cavallino trained in the workshop of Massimo Stanzione in the early 1640's. In the previous decade he had, however, already developed his own personal style. This picture is a splendid example of that manner, a subtle synthesis of the artist's various maturing experiences.A recent restoration has more fully revealed the extraordinary chromatic range of Cavallino, which is based on a variety of cool tones; azures, blues, and grays. These are enriched by the rich and suffused brown tones of the figures in the middle ground and the almost monochromatic rendering of the figures at the right."

36081-1view2.jpg	Cecchino del Salviati was entrusted by Cardinal Giovanni Ricci (1497-1574) to paint the hall in his newly acquired palace in the Via Giulia in Rome in 1552. In ten of the eleven rooms frescoed, mostly by little-known artists, the painting consists only of narrow wall friezes, some with themes from antiquity, some with themes from the Old Testament. By contrast, the hall, now known as the Sala dei Mappamundi and previously as the Sala dell'Udienza Invernale, received a significantly more elaborate decoration by the best available painter, Salviati.The general subject - the story of David as told in the first and second books of Samuel - was assigned to Salviati by Ricci, but in the choice of the individual scenes Salviati seems to have had great freedom.Salviati designed an original decorative system which dealt with the existing features of the room whose walls were irregularly divided by windows and doors. Above a high 'basamento' he painted an illusionistic high-columned hall on three of the walls which forms the supporting scaffold for a series of differently framed, large 'quadri riportati'. The decorative system gives the impression of being in a room in which an art lover is putting his treasures on display. The decoration is intended to show the wealth and fortune of its patron.The fifteen scenes of the story of David are not arranged in a chronological order, rather they are organized according to criteria of formal symmetry and thematic correspondences

42840-07franci.jpg	This painting came from the ceiling of the Venetian Franciscan church of San Nicol&#242; dei Frari, popularly known as San Nicol&#242; della Lattuga, on whose adornment Veronese and his colleagues lavished great effort.

After the suppression of the Franciscans in 1806, the church was demolished and the pictures were dispersed.

Both became specialists in this field after some initial forays into portraiture. Their genre paintings, which reveal an intimate knowledge of contemporary artistic developments in Haarlem, comprise an important transitional stage, both thematically and stylistically, between Buytewech's spirited interiors and the graceful images produced by the next generation of genre painters, epitomized by the work of Gerard Terborch and Johannes Vermeer.This painting is an example of the genre scenes painted with a monochrome (grey) palette fashionable in this period.

44030-0columb.jpg	Rogier was at the height of his artistic powers when, in around 1455, he painted this altarpiece for the church of St Columba in Cologne. The St. Columba Altarpiece unites three scenes which represent sequential rather than simultaneous events: the Annunciation (left wing), the Adoration of the Magi (central panel) and the Presentation in the Temple (right wing). The three scenes show the coming of Christ to earth and his subsequent recognition as ruler of the world by the three earthly kings, and as the promised Messiah by the devout Simeon and the prophetess Anna. The figure of the Virgin Mary is emphasized by the uniform blue of her clothes, a colour flanked by intense red and occurring nowhere else in the altarpiece. The exterior of the altarpiece had only a protective coating, with no painted scenes.The central Adoration of the Magi, the only depiction of this kind in Rogier's extant work, was a particularly popular subject in Cologne, for since the 12th century the city had kept relics of the Magi, its most treasured possessions, in the cathedral. The Netherlandish artist not only created this work for a patron in Cologne, but also drew inspiration from an outstanding painting done in Cologne at this period, Stefan Lochner's Altarpiece of the Patron Saints of Cologne, sometimes known as the Cathedral Altarpiece. This large retable, painted in the 1440s for the chapel of Cologne town council, unites the patron saints of the city in a magnificent, monumental work from which any trace of historical narrative has been eliminated. Rogier, perhaps at the special wish of his patron, adopted the almost central position of the Virgin Mary in the depiction of the Adoration; this was an unusual situation for her in Netherlandish art. He also echoed other motifs, including the figure of a woman seen in profile, dressed in green and with a plait of hair, who appeared on the left wing of Lochner's altarpiece and again in Rogier's Presentation; details like the sword and fluttering hatband of the youngest king; and, behind the Magi, the figure of a bearded man holding a hat in front of his chest. Traces of the late Romanesque church of St. Gereon in Cologne seem to have entered into the architecture of the temple on the right wing - the polygonal rotunda, the gallery, and the small buttresses on the outside.Other than the adoption of motifs, however, there is little to link the St. Columba Altarpiece to Lochner. As in the Middelburg Altarpiece, the panels are linked not by the background scene but by the lively sequence of figures all to the same scale, although the rotunda of the temple on the right does reach a little way into the central panel, where part of its exterior is visible. Compared with the earlier triptych, the figures are arranged in a shallower composition, not staggered back into the depths of the picture, an effect particularly clear in the second king. He looks two-dimensional, fitted in as he is between the other two, and although he is really further back the insistent red of his cloak brings him optically to the fore of the painting. The youngest king's white-clad page shows both how Rogier was composing his picture in two-dimensional terms, and how the narrow stage on which his protagonists are set is isolated from the background, which is crowded with motifs: the page is handing his master a magnificent vessel, but seems to be standing much too far back to perform the action. The page belongs to the background, which is not supposed to intrude into the foreground. Rogier clearly emphasizes the main figures inhabiting their own area at the front of the picture, an area inaccessible to the others.Rogier developed many of these figures from older designs of his own. In the course of time Rogier must have designed a whole world of easily remembered figures and motifs, to be kept in the workshop's stock of models. He did not, however, use them mechanically, but always suited them to their new environments, so that without knowing the older pictures no one would take them for stock figures - something that is frequently not the case with his successors and imitators. However, the figures in the St. Columba Altarpiece also differ from their predecessors in their nature. Their solidity and striking physicality has gone, they are more delicate and the slenderness of the figures makes their movements appear even more graceful and elaborate than in earlier works.The workshop's participation in its execution did not affect the quality of this very successful altarpiece adversely. Rogier's second son Pieter (ca. 1437-after 1514), also a painter, was probably working in the studio at this time, and so perhaps was the young Hans Memling. Even the underdrawing seems to have been done by an assistant working to the master's design, and several hands obviously took part in the painting; particularly striking is the face of the young woman on the right behind the scene of the Presentation, which deviates from Rogier's standard figures in type and in the more open, less enamel-like style of painting. The heads of the red-robed St. Joseph on the central and right wings are different in both expression and formal structure, though they are almost entirely identical in their details; the two painters responsible must have been using a very precise drawing.The impressive compositions of the St. Columba Altarpiece, the grave and aristocratic figures, their slender delicacy, echoing the ideals of the time, and the many finely worked details made a great impression on Rogier's contemporaries. In the following period, his Adoration of the Magi was regarded almost as the only correct version of the theme, and not only the painters of Cologne but also other German and Netherlandish artists drew their inspiration from it almost entirely when tackling the subject

41740-3agapit3.jpg	Two double-sided panels, one depicting scenes from the life of St Agapitus of Praeneste, and another depicting scenes from the life of St Remigius (Remi), bishop of Reims, must originally have formed the folding wings of an altarpiece. The lost altarpiece probably had another pair of folding wings.Saint Remigius (Remi or R�my), was Bishop of Reims and Apostle of the Franks (c. 437-533 AD). On 25 December 496 he baptised Clovis I, King of the Franks. This baptism, leading to the conversion of the entire Frankish people to Catholic Christianity, was a momentous success for the Church and a seminal event in European history.The first scene on this panel depicts an episode from the saint's life in which he caused a matron's empty barrel of wine to overflow by blessing it with the sign of the cross. The scene on the other side is a later event from Remigius's legend. Foreseeing a poor harvest, he filled a barn with a store of wheat, only to discover later that a group of drunken peasants set fire to the provisions.Comparison with other existing panels from workshops in northern Switzerland indicates that the panels were originated in that region

39117-egypt.jpg	"In 1753 the younger Tiepolo who, like his father, was an excellent draughtsman, published a series of etchings in Venice under the title ""Pictorial Thoughts Suggested by the Flight to Egypt"". There were twenty-seven different versions of the Holy Family on its flight from the massacre of the innocents at Bethlehem; in the etching dated 1750 the group resting under a palm-tree is represented in an arrangement similar to that of the picture in the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts. The scene, pervaded by an idyllic atmosphere, with the figures and the landscape melting into a harmonious unity, is one of the finest of Domenico's early works. At the same time it shows definite signs of the features which most clearly distinguish his art from that of his father, namely a more direct, more intimate tone, greater emphasis on landscape and profane elements, a more banal and at the same time a cooler and drier treatment of the theme"

10601-landhun.jpg	"This painting is among the earliest examples in the Netherlands, of sitters from outside court circles depicted in an equestrian portrait. The type had previously been a prerogative of royalty and high nobility. To some extent, the Dutch development during the 1650s may have been related to the collapse of the House of Orange as a political power and the rise of a burgher from Dordrecht, Johan de Witt (1625-1672), as the effective leader of the United provinces. Aelbert Cuyp's several equestrian portraits of the early to mid-1650s are all pictures of wealthy burghers (most likely from Dordrecht) hunting with hounds.The present painting represents two young members of a distinguished Dordrecht family: on the left, Cornelis Pompe van Meerdervoort (1639-1680), and, in the centre, his slightly older brother Michiel (1638-1653). The costumes of the figures are exotic outfits modeled on Hungarian dress. The two boys and their riding instructor wear tight-fitting velvet coats (called ""dolm�ny"") over elaborate shirts.

While they sought to capture the fleeting impression of a casual glance, he often emphasized the forms and patterns that build the structure of a scene. He sought to reveal the inner geometry of nature.The present scene showing rocks in a forest is thought to have been observed during one of C�zanne's working trips to the forest of Fontainebleau, sometime around 1893.

19041-w_terni.jpg	"Hackert's output shows how his landscapes, which initially suggest the Baroque, become increasingly ""classical"". However, unlike other contemporaries, who dismissed him in contempt as a ""veduta painter"" and probably also because he made no secret of his commercial success, Hackert remained faithful to topographic accuracy in his landscapes. This greatly appealed to his buyers who wanted to take their experience of Italy home with them. Nevertheless, The Waterfalls at Terni shows that Hackert could master the heroic landscape, too. The relative sizes of the rocks and trees and the depth of perspective are skillfully blurred so that the waterfall, however large it may be in reality, looks imposing. Paintings like this set a new focus in Neoclassical and Romantic painting in Germany: what we call ""'heroic"" and later ""sentimental"" landscape painting."

31116-4vision1.jpg	"The story continues in the lower picture compartment to the right of the altar with the Vision of Constantine.Constantine the Great (c. 280-337), was a Roman Emperor, the son of Helena. He came to overall power in 312 after defeating the Emperor Maxentius at the battle of the Milvian bridge on the Tiber, an event traditionally regarded as the turning point in the establishment of Christianity within the empire. According to Eusebius' Life of Constantine (1:27-32), on the eve of the battle Constantine saw in a dream a cross in the sky, and heard a voice saying, 'In hoc signo vinces' - 'By this sign shalt thou conquer.' Henceforth, it is said, he substituted the emblem for the Roman eagle on the standard, or laborum, of the legions.Earlier it was thought to be a nocturnal scene. However, the recent restoration revealed it is not a night scene but a dawn, captured at its first stirrings, when still glitter in the sky. Inside his large tent, the Emperor lies asleep. Seated on a bench bathed in light, a servant watches over him and gazes dreamily out towards the onlooker, as though in silent conversation. With a daring innovation, that almost seems to anticipate Caravaggio's modern concept of light, the two sentries in the foreground stand out from the darkness, lit only from the sides by the light projected from the angel above. The divine messenger descends from on high, showing the Cross made of light to the emperor deep in sleep, to whom he communicates the certainty of victory if the army moves under the sign of the Cross: ""In hoc signo vinces"""

09369-haywain0.jpg	John Constable's father was a wealthy Suffolk miller. Constable's truthfulness to nature and devotion to his native scene have passed into legend. Less widely known, however, is his biographer's report that it was seeing Claude's Hagar and the Angel (now in the National Galleery, London) and watercolours by Girtin which first provided him with 'pictures that he could rely on as guides to the study of nature'. Ruisdael, Rubens, Wilson and Annibale Carracci were among other 'reliable guides' whose work he copied as a young man. He also learned from contemporary painters, never forgetting the advice given him by Benjamin West, the President of the Royal Academy: 'Always remember, sir, that light and shadow never stand still...in your skies... always aim at brightness...even in the darkest effects...your darks should look like the darks of silver, not of lead or of slate.'Constable's youthful exclamation, 'There is room enough for a natural painture [i.e. style of painting]', must be understood not as the outpouring of a 'natural painter' but as the proclamation of an aspiring student struggling for proficiency in the language of art, which shaped his deepest feelings before he could give expression to them.The Hay-Wain, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 and at the British Institution in 1822 under the title Landscape: Noon, was one of the big 'six-footers' on which Constable worked in the winters in London from sketches and studies made in the country in summer. The harvest wagon of the modern title was copied from a drawing made by John Dunthorne, Constable's childhood friend and assistant, and sent at Constable's request from Suffolk. The view is of farmer Willy Lott's cottage on a mill stream of the River Stour near Flatford Mill, of which Constable's father had the tenancy. A full-scale sketch for the picture is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In this final version Constable omitted a figure on horseback at the edge of the stream, substituting a barrel which he later painted out (but which is beginning to show through).In thus 'selecting and combining' from 'some of the forms and evanescent effects of nature' Constable sought an 'unaffected truth of expression' without the loss of poetry. He laboured 'almost fainting by the way' to preserve the sparkle of sketches in these large paintings worked over for many months in the studio. The Hay-Wain, that best-loved icon of the English countryside, was admired by Constable's closest friends but did not meet with success at the London exhibitions. He sold it in 1823 with two other pictures to an Anglo-French dealer who exhibited them in the 1824 Salon in Paris. There at last Constable's achievement was understood. A cast of the gold medal awarded to Constable by King Charles X of France is incorporated in the picture's frame

38223-3mother.jpg	"""Our Mother"" by Alajos Str�bl was awarded the Grand Prix at the Paris World Exhibition of 1900. He worked on it for three years and completed it in the year of the Millennium, 1896. Although it is doubtlessly one of the most intimate work of Hungarian sculpture, it had only moderate success in Hungary, despite the fact that the Museum of Fine Arts bought it year it was completed. The artist chose the subject himself, inspired by an inner drive. The chosen subject clearly determined the style of representation, the sensitive modelling and the emotional content. The expressiveness and its human warmth make it one of the outstanding pieces of Hungarian sculpture from the turn of the century.""Our Mother"" shows an old woman sitting in a high-backed armchair, resting her hands on an open book but glancing up from her reading. In the beautiful features of his mother, the artist has managed to express the understanding and wisdom acquired over a long lifetime.

09091-lucretia.jpg	The story of the rape of Lucretia was one of the best-known episodes in the early history of Rome. It told how Sextus Tarquinius, brutal son of the tyrannical king, forced the virtuous wife Lucretia to accede to his lust by threatening that he would kill both her and her servant-boy if she refused, and afterwards claim that he had discovered them together in the act of adultery. To prevent this dishonour to her husband and family, Lucretia permitted herself to be raped, and was thereby able to tell her story and demand vengeance before she committed suicide.Lucretia is portrayed at three-quarter length with the upper body bared to reveal her breasts spilling from precious fabrics and with jewellery draped across her naked skin. The female figure convey an immediate impression of beauty and luxury.

26258-winckel.jpg	Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717-1768) was a German art historian and archaeologist, a pioneering Hellenist who first articulated the difference between Greek, Greco-Roman and Roman art. He was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the history of art. Many consider him the father of the discipline of art history. His influence was decisive on the rise of the neoclassical movement during the late eighteenth century. His writings influenced not only a new science of archaeology and art history but Western painting, sculpture, literature and even philosophy. Winckelmann's History of Ancient Art (1764) is  a classic book of European literature.Anton Raphael Mengs was a follower of Winckelmann's ideas

08099-cookport.jpg	The free, expressive style used to paint this Portrait of a Cook is reminiscent of the spirited art of Bernardo Strozzi, who had moved to Venice around 1632-1633, bringing with him Niccol&#242;'s father, Giovanni Francesco (c. 1620-1690), himself a painter as well. The figure of the cook is posed in an interior, a dark wall behind him. The artist's palette makes use of fairly muted colours, such as the browns and pinkish reds that contrast with the luminous, seductively carefree whites.

11556-adorati1.jpg	The gracefully delicate small-sized pictures of lyrical tone were formerly attributed to Sebastiano Ricci. However, it was exactly their fragile charm and the absence of power and plastic forms which showed them to be the works of Diziani, and not of Ricci, a more passionate and more robust master. In his own time Diziani was an extremely popular and widely employed painter; many of his works had been recorded to be in churches and monasteries of Venice and the Terra Ferma. In the 19th century, however, his name almost fell into oblivion; his pictures, if mentioned at all, were in most cases attributed to Ricci, his brilliant drawings to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini.The pendant of this painting, representing the Adoration of the Shepherds is also in the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts. Both paintings were commissioned by a private collector. Few accurately dated works of Diziani are known, therefore it is far from easy to attribute a date to the two pictures. Their style is closest to The Adoration of the Magi in the church of S. Stefano in Venice, an authentic work of Diziani from the thirties

20050-10musica.jpg	Honthorst was born in Utrecht; there he was Abraham Bloemaert's pupil. He is said to have been in Rome as early as 1610-12, but he is not documented there until 1616. Nothing is known about his artistic activity until the last year of the decade, and not a work painted before he went to south has been discovered. He became the best-known Dutch follower of Caravaggio. A typical example of his religious paintings executed in Italy is the Christ before the High Priest (National Gallery, London).Though Honthorst continued to depict scenes from the Scripture  after his return to Utrecht in 1620, the religious pictures he made in Rome are from many points of view the climax of his work as a  painter of biblical themes. During the 1620s he painted works in the arcadian mode which shows that he had looked at the Carracci as well as the Caravaggio while in Italy. Besides religious and mythological scenes he painted at least one illusionistic ceiling, Musical Group on a Balcony, which was done for his own house in Utrecht. The painting, only partially preserved, is the earliest existing Dutch illusionistic painted ceiling.

37967-v_school.jpg	Jan Steen was born in Leiden but is said to have studied with Nicolas Kn�pfer in Utrecht, Adrian van Ostade in Haarlem and Jan van Goyen, whose daughter he married in 1649, in The Hague. He continued to move from town to town, being recorded in The Hague, Leiden and Delft during the course of his career. He was an enormously prolific painter who concentrated on lively genre scenes, although he also painted portraits and religious and mythological subjects. His work, which is markedly uneven in quality, is characterized by a robust humour, a sense of theatre and, often, a moralizing intention.Steen's The Village School is in the satirical tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder's print The Ass at School which illustrates a popular saying: 'Though an ass goes to school in order to learn, he'll still be an ass, not a horse, when he returns'. In Steen's school there is little to be learnt from the short-sighted teacher who is so intent on sharpening his quill that he fails to notice the chaos around him. Some children who are keen to learn have gathered around the schoolmistress who corrects their spelling but others fight, sing, make fun of the teachers and even sleep. On the right a child hands a pair of spectacles to an owl, a familiar symbol of foolishness in Steen's work

12319-8london.jpg	The London Triptych is a portable altarpiece of medium size, consisting of three panels. On the sides, to the left and right respectively, are saints Dominic and Aurea (45 x 20 cm each). St Aurea, a virgin martyr rarely depicted, was the patron saint of Ostia. She is identified by a fragmentary inscription on the panel. On the central panel (61 x 39 cm) is the Virgin and Child with four angels. The upper section shows seven prophets, identified by the Bible verses contained in their scrolls; from the left they are: Daniel, Moses, Isaiah, David (in a perfect central position and distinguished by his name and crown), Abraham, Jacob and Jeremiah.Opinions vary as to the dating of the triptych, but it is generally agreed to be by Duccio. The overall arrangement of the central piece belongs to the same stylistic phase as the Madonna in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where the figure of the Child (painted very small according to oriental custom) and the slight twist of Mary's body to allow for the wide gesture of her outspread arm, are similar. On the other hand, the obvious taste for decorativeness and the rhythmic linearity of contour, displaying a wholly Gothic tendency, suggest a much later date, some years after the Maest&#224;. Owing to its perfect state of preservation it is still possible to appreciate the glowing tints of the drapery, with its inevitable gilded edges, and the delicate transparency of St Aurea's veil and the Child's little garment

34707-debacle.jpg	In 1887 a small group of North American artists &#151; John Leslie Breck, William Blair Bruce, Willard Metcalf, Louis Ritter, Theodore Robinson, Henry Fitch Taylor, and Theodore Wendel &#151; settled in Giverny for the summer season. Some appear to have been previously unaware of Monet's presence in the village, but at least two of them, Robinson and Metcalf, had visited during earlier summers. They set up their easels along the streams or on the hillside and became acquainted with their newly adopted village from a distance. At first they avoided depicting the village itself, preferring more familiar landscape motifs. Gradually, artists in Giverny began to experiment with Impressionism, inspired by Monet and also by the region's dramatic light. Within a few years, many began to employ the more luminous, high-keyed palette and looser brushwork characteristic of impressionism.In the work of Robinson, North America made its own first influential contribution to Impressionism. Though a good friend of Monet from 1886 on, he never became dependent on the Frenchman's style. The years Robinson spent at Giverny before finally returning to the US in 1892 fell into two stylistic periods. In the first, he painted figures in landscape settings as well as pure landscapes. (La d�b�cle represents this style.) In the second phase the individual features were dissolved into highlights of colour that were stripped of contour or detail. The Wedding March, painted in 1982 for the wedding of the American artist Theodore Earl Butler and Suzanne Hosched�-Monet, Monet's stepdaughter, is a fine example of this phase

25310-infanta.jpg	Margarita was the daughter of Philip IV. In 1673, when she was still only fifteen, she became the wife of Leopold I, Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. In the last years of his life Vel�zquez painted the little girl several times; she is the central figure in one of the last great compositions, Las Meninas, produced in 1656. In the Spanish court, which at that time was almost paralysed by the rigid rules of etiquette, this little girl represented the spirit of life itself, a girl whose charm was acknowledged by everyone; even the French ambassador, a man who was very hard to please, praised her in a letter to Louis XIV. She was charming in spite of the fact that she had inherited her father's heavy Habsburg features.As was the way with monarchs of medieval times, Philip IV made use of Vel�zquez and his workshop, including Mazo, as a king might today make use of a court photographer. He ordered several variants of the picture, in each one of which the dresses were to be differently coloured. In this painting, which was executed by Mazo, a strange contrast is realized: the little girl's fair tresses and delicate fingers express the carefree existence of a child but the lips already show some of the Habsburg characteristics, the eyes are precocious and sad and the body is stiff, imprisoned by the rigid armour of the stays. On the other hand, the grand dress of green silk and velvet, so unsuitable for a child of nine or ten, has a strange animation of its own, as if to offer the child, in recompense for her loss of freedom, gold threads and grandeur

38292-2saddleh.jpg	Signed and dated lower centre: Geo: Stubbs p:/1793There are eighteen paintings by Stubbs in the Royal Collection, all of which were almost certainly commissioned by George IV, or else acquired by him. Seventeen of these date from the early 1790s when Stubbs seems to have been particularly busy on behalf of his royal patron, to the extent that many of his pictures are recorded as being in store at Carlton House. A bill dated 14 February 1793 for frames made by Thomas Allwood reads: 'To Carving &#38; Gilding eight Picture frames of half length size for sundry Pictures painted by Mr Stubbs. all of one pattern.' This is endorsed by Stubbs and the amount charged was ^110 l6s. 0d. The frame around the present picture is one of those made by Allwood.William Anderson began as helper and hack-groom to George IV, when Prince of Wales, from 1788 to 1800, but he was appointed head groom in 1804 and finally Groom of the Stables in 1812. He wears royal livery - a scarlet coat with blue hat, collar and cuffs. The real subject of the painting, however, is not so much Anderson as the two chestnut horses of which George IV was particularly fond. A letter of 15 April 1790 from the Prince of Wales to his sporting companion, Sir John Lade, states: 'I have driven every day of late the chestnut horses wh. go better than any horses I have belonging to me.' The prince himself is shown riding a chestnut horse in a portrait by Stubbs, painted two years before the present painting (Royal Collection).William Anderson with two Saddle-horses is a painting of outstanding quality. The composition is deceptively simple with the overlapping flanks of the two horses, silhouetted against the sky, fused in a memorable pattern. The emphasis throughout is on the horizontal and the only firm vertical is Anderson himself, rigid in the saddle of the leading horse. The languorous rhythm of the horses in the foreground of the picture is offset by the large expanse of sky, which takes up as much as three-quarters of the canvas, and by the flat rolling landscape contained within the remaining quarter. Stubbs achieves a moving, almost poetic, balance within the picture which should not be seen simply as an exercise in design. The artist uses his knowledge of anatomy in the depiction of the horses and there is a surprising variety of observation in the treatment of the clouds, the glimpse of the sea on the left, the copse and the burdock plants in the right foreground. The sea suggests that Anderson is shown riding near Brighton, a resort which the Prince of Wales first visited in 1783 and where he leased property in 1780 that was by degrees enlarged, originally by Henry Holland and then John Nash, to become the Royal Pavilion. The town became highly fashionable and had the added advantage of having a racecourse. In 1807-8 a stable block was added to the Pavilion with room for fifty-four horses. Domestic accounts record that Anderson was billetted in Brighton for twelve days in 1793 in addition to his work at Windsor. The second horse in the painting has presumably been saddled for the Prince of Wales

18323-1211grec.jpg	Probably painted for the Colegio de Do&#241;a Maria, Madrid. It is of the same size and shape as the Pentecost, to which it was almost certainly a pair. The place of these two paintings in the chapel is more difficult to decide. The Resurrection was almost certainly on the left and the Pentecost on the right, because of their relationship in meaning with the Nativity and the Baptism, respectively. If they were placed above these two paintings, the narrower format would correspond with the upper range of paintings. This and the Pentecost would have been the last of the paintings executed for the Colegio.Only one other painting of the subject by El Greco is known, that for Santo Domingo el Antiguo. This painting and the Adoration of the Shepherds are higher in proportion to their width than the corresponding paintings in Santo Domingo el Antiguo.Christ is shown in a blaze of glory, striding through the air and holding the white banner of victory over death. The soldiers who had been placed at the tomb to guard it scatter convulsively. Two of them cover their eyes, shielding themselves from the radiance, and two others raise one hand in a gesture of acknowledgement of the supernatural importance of the event. Another wearing a helmet decorated with brilliantly coloured plumes, rests his cheek on his hand - the traditional pose of melancholy - still unaware of Christ's resurrection. El Greco's skill in creating dramatically foreshortened figures is clamorously apparent in the soldier wearing a yellow cuirass sprawled in the foreground and in the adjacent soldier in green. By excluding any visual reference to the tomb or to landscape, El Greco removed the scene from the realm of history, he articulated its universal significance through the dynamism of nine figures that make up the composition and the intensity of the light and colours.Again El Greco has created one of the greatest interpretations of the subject in art. It can, perhaps, only be compared with the great masterpiece by Piero della Francesca. Light is the important element in this image of the Risen Christ, as it was in the Adoration of the Shepherds, but of a different quality. The movement has an incomparably greater force than in the Santo Domingo painting and has nothing of the sharp explosive quality of the earlier work. The movement is not dissipated, but is contained and concentrated. The figures now are vehicles of movement and light. It is interesting to compare the treatment of the classical 'draperies' of the soldier at the base of the composition with those of the saintly warriors of the Martyrdom of Saint Maurice and his Legions

37270-5saints1.jpg	The group of saints painted alongside the altar dedicated to St Elizabeth in the right transept of the Basilica is an expression of the political and religious feeling that bound the House of Anjou to Hungary and the Spirituals. Scholars have found plausible historical explanations for their presence and identified them. Proceeding from left to right, after Saints Francis, Louis of Toulouse and Elizabeth of Hungary, we find St Margaret: this figure had always been identified as St Clare, until a recent cleaning revealed a small cross, the symbol of St Margaret. Next to her is a young and very beautiful saint, who is probably Henry, Prince of Hungary (and not Louis IX of France, as had been suggested: how could he be a king without a crown?), the son of St Stephen, shown on the next wall with St Ladislaus and the Madonna and Child.The presence of all these members of the House of Anjou in the frescoes in Assisi is justified, in other words, by the close connection existing between the Order and the royal family, and it is quite suitable that they be placed here, in the chapel of Cardinal Gentile da Montefiore who was both a Franciscan and a good friend of the Anjou

19827-3meyer1.jpg	There is a companion-piece of this painting, the portrait of the sitter's wife, Dorothea Meyer, n�e Kannengiesser.The transference of artistic knowledge and material from Italy northwards through the Alpine passes during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century led to the emergence of Italianate portrait-construction in Germany. This was being practiced with increasing confidence by the time Holbein received his first commissions. D�rer was crucial here, primarily through his Venetian visits in 1496-7 and 1506. Holbein eschewed most of the emotionalism intricately bound up in D�rer's view of the world and once having developed his ability to make a calm appraisal of the sitter's condition, as demonstrated here, maintained it throughout his career. This has led to the mistaken belief that little or nothing changed in his technique over thirty-five years.As a result of the power and poise of Holbein's preliminary silverpoint portrait, line dominates over colour and texture throughout the painting, except, ironically, in the face. The lines of the bunched fingers compel attention more against the undifferentiated dark jacket, and the illustrative rigour of the architectural background belies the subtlety of light and shadow in the face, perhaps revealing an overly self conscious borrowing of Italianate design at this early stage in the artist's career.The portrait seems to have had a personal function, as the mayor and his wife are informally, if splendidly, dressed. Meyer's main concern would have been the proud display of his wealth, which had enabled this merchant's son to become the first mayor of Basel who was not from the city's upper class but a representative of the guilds. The coin that Meyer holds out prominently towards the viewer presumably refers first and foremost to his occupation as a moneychanger, and only secondarily to the right of the city of Basel, confirmed in 1516 by the Emperor Maximilian (emperor 1486-1519), to mint gold coins. The numerous gold rings on Mayer's left hand vividly demonstrate his prosperity. With his right index finger he points discreetly at his wife, who is likewise richly arrayed, in her case in pearls and gold chains, and clothes and bonnet that are expensively embroidered and laced with gold thread. Even the architecture  - with its glossy columns of red veined marble, richly decorated frieze with classical acanthus leaves, and expensively coffered barrel vaulting borrowed from Italian Renaissance architecture - creates a splendid frame for the figures. Holbein places the self assured man in front of the solid pier, thus underlining his physical dominance vis-&#224;-vis the petite woman, who is seated against a monochrome blue background.In a small cartouche in the frieze above the head of Jakob Meyer, mayor of Basel, Hans Holbein has signed the double portrait with his initials and dated it 1516. This is the first time Holbein, still an apprentice painter, emerges from anonymity. The architecture provides a link between the two portraits and creates a shared space for the figures; prior to Holbein, such a pictorial concept was unknown in Basel panel painting. The same applies to the decorative elements on the architecture, derived from the Italian Renaissance, such as the coffered vault and the acanthus leaf frieze, which incorporates two putti

39013-1hall1.jpg	The magnificently-decorated Imperial Hall is the highpoint of the ceremonial sequence of public rooms in the Residence. The room is high and wide, well-lit by tall windows on three sides, and is situated in the central axis of the Residence overlooking the garden. It rises from the ground plan of an elongated octagon and is vaulted by an imposing oval cupola with ten, for the most part windowed, lunettes. Having passed through the White Room, with its neutral white stucco decoration by Antonio Bossi, the visitor enters the Imperial Hall someway down its length and is at first overwhelmed by the polychromatic variety of its decoration: by the walls with its divisions of half columns in red stucco marble, by the white and gold stucco decoration of the vault, by the areas of shellwork, by the sculptures and, not least, by Tiepolo's frescoes. In the Imperial Hall, architecture, ornamental structuring and painted decoration form an incomparable unity and so create one of the most beautiful secular rooms of the Baroque period.Tiepolo's frescoes, too, have been designed to make an impact on the viewer as he enters the room. The central ceiling fresco is intended to bring together the themes of the two wall paintings, and to illustrate these in a generally allegorical form.This picture shows the view towards the south end of the Imperial Hall and the portrayal of the marriage of Barbarossa and Beatrice of Burgundy, and shows how the fresco is incorporated into the opulence of the overall decoration

43552-tribunal.jpg	With Pieter Bruegel, the great era of the Flemish Primitives reached a new zenith, and at the same time the beginning of the end. With the death of this master whose art was firmly rooted in the fatherland, the coast was clear for the invasion of foreign ideas from Italy. There were successive influxes of imported art from Rome, Venice and Florence, and much work produced by Flemish artists in the Italianate style, some of it without a clear understanding of the principles involved. But in all this, there was nothing which could spark off a new creative development of specifically Flemish art.In the second half of the 16th century, many Italianate painters looked to the work of Frans Floris, which was based on the formal language of Michelangelo, and Titian and Tintoretto's use of colour, as their ideal. One of his followers in Antwerp was Maarten de Vos, who was strongly influenced by Venetian art, but did not adopt Michelangelo's muscular figures. He was the inspiration behind these late Mannerists and the most productive painter of his time; his death marked the end of a period in the history of art in Antwerp. Shortly after, Rubens was to return from Italy in 1608 and give a powerful new impetus to the School of Antwerp.The Tribunal of the Brabant Mint in Antwerp is a representative example of the work of de Vos, not just as a figure painter but also as a portraitist.The painting, which is a tableau representing justice, was painted in 1594 to hang in the Law Court of the 'Minters' of the Duchy of Brabant. Such paintings were intended to remind both Judges and those seeking justice of their duty and responsibilities.The members of the Brabant League of Minters commissioned the painting, and had themselves depicted (from the waist up) in the background, behind the symbolic figures from classical antiquity surrounding Justitia herself. Justitia, crowned with laurels and holding the scales of justice and a sword, triumphs over deceit and violence, symbolised by a masked woman caught in her own web and a violent miscreant who has been disarmed.In the foreground on the left, Moses is depicted with the Tables of the Law, and on his right the Emperor Justinian, the codifier of Roman Law. On the right there is the bearded Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, who compiled sacred laws inspired by his wife, the nymph Egeria. On the far right, Pliny the Elder can be seen, with his left hand resting on the 37 scientific works he wrote.In a nutshell, the message of this scene is that justice triumphs over deceit and violence, and that judges should judge according to sacred and civil law, guided by knowledge and science

37497-still_li.jpg	"Just as a circle of specialists for individual genres gathered in Amsterdam around Rembrandt, the same was true in Antwerp around Rubens. Snyders frequently collaborated with him on arrangements of objects and staffage. On the other hand, Snyders also adopted Rubens' new Baroque principles into his own specialized area of still life. The result was a number of new pictorial types in this field.He initially drew upon the great kitchen interiors and pantry paintings of the Flemish Mannerists such as Aertsen or Beuckelaer. However, whereas these artists created ""epic"" arrangements of enormous breadth, Snyders sought to produce more dynamic still-lifes. He created the hunting still-life which not only features game, but also includes certain elements of the hunt itself, and in which each animal, dead or alive, still has its own tale to tell. In his portrayal of animals, he was peerless in his time. Whereas Dutch still-life presented coded ""truths"" and warned of the transience of earthly life, Snyders staged a theatrical drama portraying the riches of the world. Snyders' pantry scenes, a variation on the hunting still-life, are equally dynamic"

17528-6christ.jpg	This devotional image, one of Gossart's most popular pictures, exists in twenty surviving copies, bearing various titles. The theme provided an opportunity for the artist to render a muscular nude body and slightly bent-over torso based on the Belvedere Torso, which Gossart must have seen on his 1508-09 trip to Rome and likely recorded in a now-lost drawing.Gossart was inspired by two prints by D�rer as he created this composition. One was the Man of Sorrows on the title page of the Large Passion, the other the Man of Sorrows by the Column from the Engraved Passion.Among the large number of surviving copies are several that are signed indicating Gossart's authorship of an original produced in 1527.

00531-2east.jpg	"The subject of the east wall, which unfolds in several registers and stages has been given many different names. Since the 16th century it has usually been known as ""Ecclesia militans"" and ""Ecclesia triumphans."" More recently it has been described as the ""Via veritatis,"" the Church as the Path to Salvation. In addition to the idea of making the observer aware, via images, of the official church and its institutions as the true path to salvation, the intention was also to emphasize, among the institutions of the Church, the Dominican order and its work.The sequence of pictorial motifs begins in the lower left quarter of the image with the depiction of Ecclesia in the form of a large church building patterned after the Florence Cathedral. In front of the side wall of the Cathedral, we can see the hierarchic order of the medieval society: the Pope, at his left the Emperor and King, a prince, at his right the Dominican general and a bishop. Before them are the friars at the left and laymen at the right; then noblemen and knights, merchant, scholar, finally women and the lower ranks of the society. The basilica in the background is the symbol of the Church. The prevailing opinion in the literature is that Urban V is to be recognized in the figure of the pope and Charles IV in the figure of the emperor, Gil de Albornoz in the cardinal, Peter I of Cyprus in the king. Lying at the feet of the pope are several sheep, in front of the sheep, and watching over them, are black-and-white spotted dogs, the 'domini canes' symbolizing the Dominican friars. On the right side of the picture St Dominic is preaching, St Thomas Aquino debating the heretics, St Peter the Martyr signaling the dogs to tear the heretics to pieces. Above these scenes there is the happy world of music and dance.Above the east wall in the vault cell, Andrea painted a free copy of the famous mosaic by Giotto known as the Navicella, from the Old St. Peter's"

19585-prodigal.jpg	The parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15, 1 1-22) illustrates above all the theme of repentance and the infinite nature of divine mercy. By choosing to show the episode, mentioned only in passing in the Bible, of the young man wasting away his inheritance in debauchery, Hemessen underlines, on the contrary, the hard lot of mankind constantly harassed by its faults. This novel interpretation originates in the developments that the literature of the period brings to the theme. The iconography created in this way was to be immensely successful and would underlie the Brothel Scenes and Joyous Companies that flourish in later Flemish painting.In an astonishingly novel setting, the artist places in the foreground the prodigal son, surrounded by women of easy morals and abandoning himself to the sins of the senses: lechery, gluttony, laziness. The artist peoples the scene with strongly characterised, almost caricatural figures, that we find again in several of his paintings: the aging pimp with a cupidinous and revolting grin, the red-faced, jeering drunk, the avid gambler, the prostitute. These large figures strike the viewer with their bold foreshortening and their brusque gestures.Concerned to express the third dimension, the artist explores, not without difficulty, the plastic possibilities offered by the monumental forms of Italian art, onto which he grafts the at times cruel realism and vision of detail that are specific to the Flemish tradition. All this strengthens the ambiguity of the picture, which takes pleasure in displaying vices under the pretext of condemning them. The story continues at the back of the picture: the prodigal son, having lost all his money and his pourpoint, is chased out of town; relegated to tending the pigs he expresses a sincere repentance. Finally, he returns to the house of his father, who pardons him.The shift from the large figures in the foreground to the miniaturised episodes in the background is somewhat abrupt. Only the colonnaded portico, decorated with grotesques and foliated scrolls, provides a relative transition. The elegant, rapidly drawn figures in the background are the work of an anonymous fellow artist, known as the Master of Paul and Barnabas, who was deeply influenced by the famous tapestry patterns done in Rome by Raphael and sent to Brussels in 1517 for weaving

13626-03ferenc.jpg	"""Gardeners"" was painted during Ferenczy's Szentendre period. Composition, lighting, colours and details follow naturalism. It is typical of him in composition that  space becomes limited. The figures of the old gardener and the boy standing next to him have characteristic contours in front of a homogeneously light background. Their group can be easily identified even from a larger distance. The arrangement of figures and the balance between light and dark colours prove Ferenczy's sense of decoration  which played an important role all through his career as a painter. He characterizes forms with a delicate contrast  of light and shadow. Ferenczy had prepared two composition studies prior to the picture with models appearing in other oil pictures (""Gardener"" and""Gardener Watering Plants""). ""Gardeners"" is considered to be a major picture of Ferenczy's first art period.

04391-dominic.jpg	The mature style of Berruguete was formed by a synthesis of Flemish and Italian influences. This synthesis is best seen in �vila where he worked from 1499 until his death in 1504. His principal patron in this city was the Dominican monastery of Santo Tom�s, where he created paintings for the main altarpiece, dedicated to St Thomas Aquinas, and two subsidiary altars, dedicated to St Peter Martyr and St Dominic, and which are the best demonstration of his hybrid style. The best known picture from Santo Tom�s represents St Dominic seated in the middle of a high tribune, pardoning a heretic from death at the stake.St Dominic was a Spanish saint born in Castile in 1170. At the age of fourteen he was admitted to the University of Valencia and from there he went to the South of France to preach against the Albigensian heresy. The order he founded was militant in combating the enemies of the Church and, as may be seen in Berruguete's pictures among others, played a leading role in the conflict with the Albigensians.Berruguete lived during the last years of the reconquista when those sentenced to be burned at the stake were mostly Moors who had been converted to Christianity but who were suspected of practicing Mohammedanism in secret. Berruguete witnessed the death of these heretics and this painting faithfully illustrates the manner in which the sentences imposed by the Inquisition were enforced in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries: he records the half reprieve granted to penitents, the throttling that preceded burning and even the pointed hats worn by those condemned to do penance. Berruguete's way of representing the platform, and the delicacy, elegance and harmony of his colours are all indications that the innovations of Italian art of the fifteenth century had already found their way to Spain.In fact Berruguete worked in Italy, in the court of Federico da Montefeltro, Prince of Urbino, in the early 1480s together with Piero della Francesca, Melozzo da Forli and Luca Signorelli. He was basically a Renaissance painter with strong Spanish-Flemish traditions

23052-1triptyc.jpg	"The three paintings were originally in the church of the former convent of Santa Petronilla in Siena (originally it was the church of the Umiliati), and they have been recomposed into a triptych in the Siena Pinacoteca. Their provenance justifies the scroll held by the Child: ""beati pauperes"", blessed be ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God (Luke, 6:20). The Child lovingly has one arm around his mother's neck, while the Virgin holds her face next to the Child's, gazing at him with an intense and penetrating look. It is this look of Mary's, fully aware and in sorrow for she already knows of the Saviour's Passion and the grief that awaits them both, that is the entirely new and original feature of Ambrogio's paintings of the subject of the Madonna and Child; and he devotes a great deal of attention to this expression.The two saints at the sides, Mary Magdalene to the left and St Dorothea to the right, participate in this moment of deep intimacy with their calm gestures.  In the Middle Ages there was a great deal of confusion between several different female characters and they were frequently blended into one person: one is the nameless woman sinner who spread ointment over Christ's feet in the house of the Pharisee and was pardoned precisely because of her great love for Christ, whose feet she had washed with her tears, and kissed and dried with her hair (Luke, 7:36-46); another is Mary Magdalene, possessed by the evil spirits and healed by Christ (Luke, 8:2), who was the first to see him after the Resurrection (Mark, 16:9); and lastly, Mary of Bethany, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, who foresees the imminent death of Christ and pours a precious ointment on his head during the feast in Bethany (Matthew, 26:6-13). Lorenzetti, too, blends together these different characters: Mary Magdalene holds in her hand a precious ointment pot and, because of her beauty and red dress, she is probably the blonde sinner Christ saw in the house of the Pharisee; but on her breast we see the bleeding face of the crucified Christ, which is the dramatic foreboding that Martha's sister had in Bethany, although it is placed on the heart, to symbolize, once again, the great love shown by the sinner.On the other side, St Dorothea, with her lap full of flowers, offers a bunch of flowers while looking at the Christ Child in a serious and intense way: this is a reference to the culminating moment of her story, when while she is being led off to her martyrdom she meets the unbelieving Theophilus, who asks her to send him flowers and fruit from the garden of Paradise. The saint then concentrates in prayer and just before she is decapitated a child (the Christ Child) appears to her, bearing a basket of flowers and fruit which will succeed in converting Thephilus.In the triptych both the saints continue with the sorrowful meditations of the Virgin; Mary Magdalene shows the Man of Sorrows on her heart and the pot of ointment, in memory of the one she took to the already empty sepulchre; Dorothea, on the other hand, who is looking straight at Jesus, is showing him the bunch of flowers, the symbol of her martyrdom and of the gardens of Paradise where the Saviour is waiting for her. Christ's earthly life is recounted in the splendid predella containing the Lamentation over the Dead Christ"

19895-0ambassa.jpg	This huge panel is one of the earliest portraits combining two full-length figures on the scale of life. A paean to two scholar-diplomats and to the artist's virtuosity, it is on closer examination a reminder also of the brevity of life and of the vanity of human accomplishments. While life is short, Holbein seems to say, art is long-lasting - but eternity endures for ever.On our left stands Jean de Dinteville, a French nobleman posted to London as ambassador. The globe on the bottom shelf shows Polisy, where he had his ch&#226;teau; the ornate sheath of the dagger in his right hand gives his age as 29. To his left stands his friend and fellow-countryman, Georges de Selve, whose visit to London in 1533 is commemorated here. A brilliant classical scholar, he had some years earlier been created Bishop of Lavaur. He leans his elbow on a book inscribed with his age: 25. In their attire, their poses and their bearing the two friends exemplify, respectively, the active and the contemplative life, which, together, complement each other.On the what-not between them Holbein has depicted the wide range of their interests - a compendium of the culture of the age. On the top shelf, the minutely rendered `Turkey' carpet bears a celestial globe and an array of astronomical and navigational instruments. The cylindrical dial gives the date as 11 April; the polyhedral dial on the right indicates two different times of day. In front of the terrestrial globe on the lower shelf lies a German text-book of Arithmetic for Merchants, propped open with a T-square. A lute and a case of recorders or flutes demonstrate both Holbein's mastery of foreshortening and the sitters' musical interests. But a string of the lute has snapped, a traditional emblem of fragility. Just visible in the top left corner, at the edge of the magnificently patterned green hanging, is a crucifix. The hymnal in front of the lute is open at Martin Luther's hymn,'Come Holy Ghost our souls inspire'. Christian faith offers hope of eternal life when dust returns to dust.Across the mosaic floor - derived from the medieval pavement in Westminster Abbey - there spreads a curious shape between the two friends. It is a skull, skilfully distorted so that its true form can only be perceived from the correct viewpoint at the edges of the panel. The painting may have been intended to hang over a staircase so that viewers might see it when ascending or descending. Possibly referring to a personal device of Jean de Dinteville, whose cap medallion bears a skull, it is also the quintessential memento mori, reminder of mortality. In Holbein's meticulously real-seeming picture, the distortion also functions as a signal that reality, as perceived by the senses, must be viewed `correctly' to reveal its full meaning. A frontal nod of recognition at the worldly semblance of things is not enough

21709-cottaged.jpg	In this painting the approach is unusually stark for the Le Nain brothers. Instead of a landscape background, there is a two-storey house belonging to the peasants, whose relative prosperity is indicated by the glass in the windows (all over Europe at this time many of the poorer classes lived in conditions far more primitive than those recorded by the Le Nain brothers).This unassuming picture is one of the most perceptive paintings to be produced in the 1640s. As in the Forge, the treatment of the low-life subject is given a totally unexpected dignity. The boy on the right and the old man next to him stare through us into space, and together they counterbalance the large area of pale stone of the house behind them. Into their expressions the artist have distilled a timelessness as far removed from anecdote as possible. Whereas in Georges de La Tour this timelessness is easier to understand because of the spiritual content of his subjects, in the depiction of a peasant's face it is rare for the artist not to be interested in telling a story, but simply to be observing what he sees. This approach, which was to preoccupy many of the most important painters of the nineteenth century, from Courbet to the Impressionists, was an anachronism in the seventeenth century and the reason why the Le Nain brothers were so untypical of artists of their time

26164-0685depo.jpg	The painting is a copy after Hans Memling.The composition shows a close-up of the Deposition. The body of Christ depicted to the knees, which is being taken down from the Cross, is supported by three men. The man on the far left is probably Nicodemus and the bald-headed man on the right Joseph of Arimathea. The St Andrew on the reverse came to light in 1959, which in itself indicates that the work must have been conceived as a rotating panel, probably the left wing of a Lamentation diptych. The right wing will have depicted the group with St John and the weeping women, as in Memling's diptych with the Deposition and the Lamentation in the Capilla Real, Granada. The painting in Bruges is the only copy with a picture on the reverse. The lifelike St Andrew is seen in the arched opening of a window niche. He is shown half-length, like the figures on the front. Two small shields in the spandrels bear the coat-of-arms of the della Costa family. The donor was thus probably the well-known Genoese Andrea della Costa (d. 1542), who was collector-general to Maximilian of Austria and orator of the deanery in Bruges. He was married to Agnes Adornes, whose coat-of-arms and guardian saint were probably included on the right wing
