27124-seignela.jpg	Pierre Mignard, known in his native France as Le Romain, lived in Rome from 1636 (visiting Venice and other northern Italian cities in 1654-5) until summoned home by King Louis XIV in 1657. His style was largely based on Annibale Carracci, Domenichino and Poussin. However, he pretended allegiance to Titian and Venetian colourism on his return to France, mainly to oppose his rival Lebrun, whom he succeeded in 1690 as First Painter to the King and Director of the Royal Academy. Despite all his years abroad, his work looks to us unmistakably French, at least as relating to the France of the Sun King's court: calculated and grand. Hogarth's xenophobic English jjudgment, half a century later, might apply to this superb portrait: 'insolence with an affectation of politeness'. But Mignard was doing no more than following the wishes of his sitter, the widow of Jean-Baptiste Colbert de Seignelay, Minister for the Navy.Catherine-Th�r�se de Matignon, Marquise de Lonray, veuve de Seignelay, instructed Mignard to portray her as the sea-nymph Thetis, to whom was said (according to Ovid's Metamorphoses XI, 221-3): 'O goddess of the waves, conceive: thou shalt be the mother of a youth who, when to manhood grown, shall outdo his father's deeds and shall be called greater than he.' Past writers have attributed Mme de Seignelay's transformation into a sea goddess to her husband's office, but it was shown that this passage from Ovid is the key to the portrait. Like Thetis, Mlle de Matignon, of old Norman nobility, had been married off against her will to a social inferior: Colbert, her husband's father and the great Minister of the King, was the son of a draper. The goddess's husband, Peleus, had to rape Thetis to 'beget on her the great Achilles', the most celebrated Greek hero of the Trojan War. 'The hero's mother, goddess of the sea, was ambitious for her son' and by descending into the fiery crater of Etna, the volcano seen here smoking in the background, obtained for him armour made by Vulcan, the blacksmith god. This is the armour, 'work of heavenly art', worn in the guise of Achilles by Marie-Jean-Baptiste de Seignelay, the eldest son for whom Mme de Seignelay had just bought a military commission.The painting's brilliant effect depends in large measure on the vast expanse of Thetis' best ultramarine-blue cloak, contrasting wonderfully with the coral and pearls in her hair, and the mauves and greens of Achilles' garments. Ultramarine was the costliest of pigments, more expensive than gold itself and for that reason seldom used by this date, and never in such quantities. Thus did Mme de Seignelay confound the rumours put about by 'mauvaises langues' that she was bankrupt. And there is more: other rumours circulated that the noble widow either was, or wished to be, mistress to the king. The Cupid proffering a precious nautilus shell brimming over with a king's ransom in jewels publicises the liaison as a fait accompli. Thus might a classical education, and the talents of a Roman-trained and responsive artist, be put to insolent use 'with an affectation of politeness'

21555-throckmo.jpg	It is by his portraits that Largilli�re is esteemed. Effective as a portraitist of groups and able to achieve in single portraits grandeur or intimacy, depending on the circumstances, he remained impressively consistent in artistic quality. He was in his seventies when he portrayed so delicately and perceptively Elizabeth Throckmorton in her habit as a Blue Nun. Pale-complexioned, pensive, and felt as distanced from the world, she is also very much a living presence, with liquid eyes and scarlet mouth, the colour of which is almost startlingly vivid amid the austere white fabrics that enfold her.Images of members of Catholic cloistered or semi-cloistered religious orders are numerous in post-Tridentine Europe.

11114-early05.jpg	Edgar Degas had come to Italy, where part of his family lived, in 1856. In Florence in 1858, he painted his portrait of the Belleli family, which represented his first brush with tradition. He worked on the picture for almost ten years before showing it under the title Family Portraits at the 1867 Salon in Paris, where it passed unnoticed. He did numerous detail studies (faces, hands) and packed the composition with deliberate meaning.The picture portrays the domestic drama of a family exiled from Naples to Florence, much to the despair of Laura (his seriously depressive cousin) and her irascible husband Gennaro, who had no proper job and whom we see turning almost reluctantly to face his wife and daughters. The youngest, Giulia, sitting on a stool with one leg tucked under her, appears impatient, lending animation to the whole, while in the great tradition of group effigies from the classical era Degas includes a portrait of his grandfather Hilaire Degas, on the wall behind his daughter Laura. Hilaire had just died in Naples (in 1858), hence the dark mourning dress, alleviated only by the girls' pinafores

17422-unequal.jpg	In the visual arts, the theme of unequal lovers was commonly the subject of prints, most often with moralizing inscriptions attached. The theme was expressed in two forms, an old woman soliciting a handsome young man or, more commonly, an old man soliciting a pretty young woman.In 1600, while at the height of his fame as an engraver and draftsman, Goltzius abandoned printmaking and took up painting.  He quickly established himself as one of the foremost painters in Haarlem and continued with undiminished prowess until his death.In the present painting Goltzius sets the large half-length figures against a blank background; they are big and forceful and so crowded into the narrow frame of the composition that they seem to push out into our space. He paints the figures in bold bright colours, and while his brushwork is sophisticated there is nothing subtle about the scene he is painting.  The man is old and ugly, with his long grey hair, moles and bulbous nose while the woman is young and firm-fleshed, with pink cheeks and swelling breasts.Goltzius and his workshop made a number of engravings of Unequal Lovers

04136-damsquay.jpg	This view shows the Dam Square in Amsterdam in the late afternoon looking north, with the Town Hall on the left, the Nieuwe Kerk beyond it, and the Waag to the right.Berckheyde painted the Dam Square in Amsterdam in a number of works from 1665 onwards. The most familiar are his views of the Town Hall looking west. These are almost portraits of the building, but often include part of the Nieuwe Kerk to the right. Almost as popular are views looking north-west, such as the present picture.The new Town Hall, later the Royal Palace, still dominates Dam Square, and was an enormous source of civic pride when completed in 1665, to the designs of Jacob van Campen. The Waag or Weigh-House was built in 1565 to replace another smaller medieval structure, and was the first building in Amsterdam to be decorated in the Renaissance style. It stood near the middle of Dam Square until demolished by the French in 1808. The oldest of the three principal buildings depicted here is the late Gothic Nieuwe Kerk, closing off the square to the north-west

18556-3arcole.jpg	Among the major names in French painting in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Gros was probably the only one who remained loyal to the national school's traditional values, seen in the work's dense structures and elaborate colour scheme. Thanks to these qualities, the conventional heroic portrait acquires an emotional charge that foreshadows Romanticism. The work's persuasiveness is heightened because Gros witnessed the event when while accompanying Napoleon during his Italian campaign in 1796

03797-073madon.jpg	The upper part of the painting was cut, it is signed at the bottom as 'IOANNESS BELLINVS'.The new relationship of form and colour sealed by the quality of light leads to results of ineffable human participation in this painting which originally hung in the offices of the Magistrato della Milizia del Mare in the Palace of the Doges. The Virgin is seated with charming naturalness on the marble throne which is reminiscent of Donatello, and joins her sensitive hands in a gesture of mute adoration of her Son who lies fully relaxed in sleep across her knees. The chromatic values of the painting are reminiscent of the way Piero della Francesca used colour in the mid-fifteenth century to unfold the perspective of his images

09016-10sheba.jpg	The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 114).When Claude Gell�e arrived as a boy in Rome from his native Lorraine, perhaps to serve as a pastry cook, landscape painting was already a recognised speciality. Claude, however, was to surpass all previous practitioners. His poetic reinventions of a Golden Age, appealing to a cultivated aristocratic clientele, were assembled in the studio from drawings made out of doors in Rome and the surrounding countryside and in the Bay of Naples. The German painter Sandrart, who accompanied him on sketching trips, described his procedures:[Claude]...only painted, on a small scale, the view from the middle to the greatest distance, fading away towards the horizon and the sky... [he is an example to all] of how one can order a landscape with clarity, observe the horizon and make everything diminish towards it, hold the colouring in proportion with the depth, each time represent recognisably the time of day or the hour, bring everything together in correct harmony by accentuating strongly the front and shading off the back in proportion...Claude's influence indeed became all-pervasive, most of all in eighteenth-century England, where it affected not only painting and collecting but the very ways in which real landscape was viewed and artificial parkland constructed.Like many of Claude's pictures, the Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba was conceived as one of a pair; its companion, the Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah ('The Mill'), is also at the National Gallery. They were commissioned by Camillo Pamphilj, nephew of Pope Innocent X. Before the exceptionally large canvases had been completed, Pamphilj renounced his cardinal's hat to marry and was expelled from Rome in disgrace; the paintings were finished for the Duc de Bouillon, French general of the papal armies. Both relate (through inscriptions, our only clues to their subjects) to stories from the Old Testament - thought at the time to be especially suitable for the pictorial decoration of cardinals' palaces - on the theme of love, or esteem, between men and women, and recounting fateful journeys. While most contemporary churchmen would have interpreted the tales as symbolic of Christ's union with the Church, Pamphilj may have wished to refer covertly to his own love for Olimpia Aldobrandini.Claude follows his usual method of simultaneously harmonising and contrasting the two pictures: the Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah is a landscape in late summer afternoon, the Embarkation a coastal view, depicted in early morning light like all of Claude's Embarkations. The Queen of Sheba's land journey 'with camels...and very much gold' to visit King Solomon (1 Kings 10:1-2) is transformed into the viewer's own imaginary voyage, leaving harbour to sail on the open sea towards the light. (The queen, a small figure in red, descends the stairs to be rowed out to her vessel moored on the horizon.)Including the sun within a painting was Claude's greatest early innovation. Exactly half-way up the canvas in this stateliest of his seaport compositions, it is the basis of its pictorial unity, all the colours and tones adjusted in relation to it Claude's palm and finger prints can be seen in many places in the sky where he smoothed transitions from one passage to the next. The boy sprawling on the quay-side shields his eyes from its dazzle, and its rays gild the rounded edges of the fluted column and Corinthian capital beside him

29915-innscene.jpg	The intimacy, whether or not with a moralising undertone, which we detect in interior paintings of other 17th-century Dutch painters (e.g. Gerard Ter Borch), are far removed from the passionate, almost un-Dutch squabbling of the Inn Scene painted by Adriaen van Ostade, who developed after 1640 towards a 'genial homeliness'.

18303-1102grec.jpg	El Greco painted the Holy Family with St Anne on a number of occasions. Whereas the version in the Hospital di San Juan Bautista in Toledo, probably executed some ten years earlier, employs a bright, almost cheerful palette, the present canvas is strikingly darker in colour, its effects of light suggestive of a storm. The inclusion of the young John the Baptist, pointing heavenwards with the index finger of his left hand, allows the painting to be seen as a vision of the future Passion.The five figures in this painting are grouped closely together, however, the spatial relationships between them are of a complicated nature. St Anne, her daughter's arm lying around her shoulders, is bending down over the infant Jesus lying in his mother's lap a reminder of Piet&#224; representations and thus again of the Passion of Christ. Joseph, complementary to St Anne, looks towards Christ from behind. By avoiding all direct eye contact between the figures, El Greco evokes a strangely unreal, dream-like atmosphere.EI Greco renounces all detail in his description of objects. The robes are treated broadly, while contours and outlines are blurred something particularly apparent in the modelling of the two children. El Greco is already moving towards the style of his late work, in which he would increasingly turn away from the portrayal of idealized nature

13711-1maddal1.jpg	The old Humilitati monastery of San Cristoforo in Vercelli was entrusted to the aristocratic family of the Corradi di Lignano in the fifteenth century. In the early sixteenth century Provost Nicolini Corradi had the old church torn down and a replacement built. Andrea Corradi's assumption of office as provost in July 1529 was accompanied by an elaborate campaign of decoration. The new church was decorated with a retable for the high altar and two fresco cycles in the transept, in the Cappella dell'Assunta and the Cappella della Maddalena, all by Gaudenzio Ferrari. The artist had returned to Vercelli in 1528 after a long period of activity in Varallo.The first frescoes were in the Cappella della Maddalena, to the right of the chancel. Gaudenzio Ferrari painted the enormous Crucifixion of Christ on the end wall of the side aisle above the altar, in which the patron saint of the altar is prominently kneeling beneath the cross. On the adjacent side wall four additional scenes from the legend of Mary Magdalene are arranged in two rows around the central window. In the painting at top left Christ is preaching in the temple whereby Mary Magdalene is converted. The following fresco shows Mary Magdalene washing and anointing Christ's feet at a banquet in the house of Simon. The lower register shows the conversion of the reigning couple of Marseilles.The division of the side wall frescoes into two registers is mirrored in the bipartite composition of the large vertical format fresco on the altar wall. In the Crucifixion of Christ the crucified tower high above the dense crowd of people below. The motifs of the top and bottom halves of the painting are closely related to the subject matter of the neighbouring frescoes at the same height on the side wall

26638-05_1pr4.jpg	Ezekiel, the Prophet of the Merkabah, the divine throne and chariot of fire, the heavenly hierarchy and the four cherubim, is shown contorted by his vision. His expressive Hebrew profile faces Zechariah to the left. There is surely some meaning in the fact that this Prophet's head is wrapped in a white turban; holy dread is written on his countenance - the brightness of the vision might have blinded him. The other Prophets are bareheaded, while the Sibyls, like the young Delphica and the old Persica, closer to earth, are veiled or shrouded so as to protect them from an excess of light. The movement of the Prophet's right hand indicates three things: surprise, self surrender, and the imparting of his vision. Michelangelo thus succeeded by sheer, direct simplicity, in endowing a simple gesture with manifold meaning. The contrast of Ezekiel's sombre, heavy garment painted in brown and lilac makes his rapture all the more poignant. The wind of the spirit brushes the fringes on his shoulder. The earth-sprite behind the old man looks terrified, while the beautiful and angelic boy beside him points heavenward with a gesture reminding us of Leonardo's 'John the Baptist' and his 'Bacchus'; late works which Michelangelo may not have seen. But great men who are ahead of their time often express some new idea simultaneously

16633-nativit.jpg	This work belongs to a group of mid-fifteenth-century Florentine paintings which could be attributed to Giovanni di Francesco, formerly known as the Master of the Carrand Triptych. It seems too large to have functioned as a predella, for it would not fit below an individual section of a polyptych. However, it could have served as the lower part of a single-field altarpiece.The composition with two scenes depicting the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi is rather sophisticated. The placement of the walls at an angle and the use of this background two divide the two scenes; the alternation of figures in frontal and profile view; and the contrast  of fully lit and penumbral areas attest to a strict spatial logic deployed to create a unified stage setting. The imposing wall is rendered with an obsession for architectural detail and measured by the grid formed by the scaffolding holes. Breaches in the wall enliven the scene by providing views onto the landscape, while elsewhere the wall remains intact and serves as backdrop for the figures. Although this type of background was inspired by Fra Angelico's Adoration of the Magi, its figurative weight anticipates Baldovinetti's Nativity in the Santissima Annunziata and the later paintings of the Nativity by Fra Filippo Lippi in Spoleto and Fra Diamante

03938-triptic3.jpg	The church Santa Maria della Carit&#224; in Venice was reconstructed in the middle of the 15th century. Various chapels were erected between 1460 and 1464 by noble families. Four chapels were decorated by altarpieces which are now associated with Jacopo Bellini and his sons: the St Sebastian Triptych in the St Sebastian Chapel; the St Lawrence Triptych in the Chapel of Lorenzo Dolfin; the Nativity Triptych in the Chapel of Andrea da Molin; the Madonna Triptych in the Chapel of Giacomo Zorzi. The four triptychs can still be seen in the church of the Carit&#224;, for which they were painted, now incorporated into the Gallerie dell'Accademia. The St Sebastian Triptych consists of a lunette (59 x 170 cm) representing the Annunciation; the left panel (127 x 48 cm) representing St John the Evangelist; the central panel (103 x 45 cm) representing St Sebastian; the right panel (103 x 45 cm) representing St Anthony Abbot.The triptych of the chapel of St Sebastian was commissioned by Zaccaria Vitturini.

18367-1602grec.jpg	On 18 June 1603 El Greco signed a contract to make and decorate an altarpiece for a miraculous image of the Virgin of Charity belonging to the Hospital de la Caridad in the small town of Illescas halfway between Toledo and Madrid. According to the contract the main altarpiece and the decoration of the vault were to contain four canvases: The Madonna of Charity, The Coronation of the Virgin, The Annunciation and The Nativity. This project was executed in collaboration with the artist's son, Jorge Manual Theotokopoulos. Under a separate contract a further painting, St Ildefonso was made.The pattern of The Coronation of the Virgin follows closely that of El Greco's first treatment of the subject at Talavera in 1591.

25950-pomona.jpg	Pomona, the classical goddess of fruit, and Vertumnus, the god of transformation, are the main figures in an episode in Ovid's Metamorphoses which is depicted here. Vertumnus enters Pomona's grove in order to convince her of his love. Because she had always run away on previous occasions when he came, he has cunningly dressed as an old woman on this occasion. By telling her about the allegory of the grapevine and elm, he is able to convince her of the importance of togetherness, for the grapevine needs something it can climb up and the elm, when considered on its own, is useless. Persuaded, Pomona gives in to love and her innermost longings and they become a couple.Vertumnus is a composite figure who represents various moments in time and historical elements in his various parts. His face is that of an old man, only the bonnet identifies him as an old woman. The feet and hands are those of a young person. This makes his transformation visible. The motif of his gait, due to which his garments are still fluttering, shows that he has just arrived. At the point where his right wrist is bent, the grapevine is entwined around the elm. The gentle touch of her shoulder with his youthful hand depicts the moment at which he reveals himself to her. Pomona's eyes are still lowered longingly while he is already gazing at her passionately.Until very recently the attribution of the painting was debated. In 1995 the existence of a documented signature by Melzi was proven, which an art dealer removed in the 18th century in order to be able to sell the picture as a work of Leonardo. Due to its poor condition, the painting was not taken seriously for a long time. It was only once it was restored that its similarity to Leonardo's works became evident

26599-09_3ce9.jpg	Quite extraordinary and truly Titanic is the last fresco, smaller in size but sublime in conception: 'Let There be Light!', with God the Father self-begetting and therefore, in a sense, self diminishing. If he divides the light from the darkness it is the creation and manifestation of himself as light. This is a strangely abstract design, characterized by primitive and intentionally artless drawing. The anthropomorphous whirlwind in cosm�c travail is an awe-inspiring sight. The fresco is Michelangelo's first act of renunciation of his art as a flight into the divine, but he will return in many a lustrum to his tumult of moving bodies which are not of this world, but gigantic images of an inconceivable beauty projected by the mind.

11536-cheeses.jpg	Early seventeenth-century still-life painters of food depict objects from a high point of view, to show as much as possible of the surface of a table, a vantage point similar to the one used by contemporary landscape, marine, and architectural painters. Symmetrically arranged platters of fruit, cheese, nuts, sweets, as well as glasses, jugs, and knives, are spread upon a flat tablecloth. The inanimate objects appear to pose in a steady light, showing how carefully every surface and texture has been scrutinized and how faithfully everything has been rendered. It is perhaps difficult for us to imagine the amazement and sheer delight seventeenth-century observers took in the skill of artists who could represent delicious food with such exactitude: our eyes have been numbed by countless colour images of food illustrated in cookery books and advertisements designed to sell packaged edibles

07940-holyhous.jpg	This painting is the altarpiece in a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto by Cardinal Ludovico Madruzzo, titular cardinal of Trento from 1569 until his death in 1600. It depicts the Translation of the Holy House, which, according to the miraculous narrative, reached present-day Loreto from Nazareth on the night of December 9&#151;10, 1294, after a period of three years during which it was twice moved by the angels. This place, chosen by the Virgin as the final destination for the translation of her house, immediately became the object of particular devotion.In the painting the Virgin is seated on the roof of the holy house, which is borne in flight by three angels; she is crowned by two other angels. The child Jesus, who sits on her knee, pours water to give relief to the penitents, who can be seen below in the flames of purgatory.The study of the painting after the recent restoration brought to light that at least two hands executed the painting. Annibale must have conceived the general layout of the altarpiece and then left it to his assistants, Domenichino in the first place, while reserving for himself the right to intervene on the composition's focal point, the figures of the Virgin and child

The horizontal format and neutral, light ochre background tone gives a greater sense of atmospheric, ambient space than in other works by the artist, a sense that is, in turn, articulated by two butterflies that fly around the blooms.

33901-16noremb.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 128.Rembrandt's portrait was particularly admired by the generation of Impressionist painters as a model example of their own view of art. It has lost none of its popularity, despite commercial exploitation, although it is questionable whether this has contributed to a genuine appreciation of the picture. All too many reproductions have given the public a preconceived image of it, before actually seeing the original. It is therefore all the more necessary to try to make a detached assessment of the work.Bode regarded the helmet as primarily an artistic end in itself. His generation, too, may have viewed the work in a more sentimental light, associating it with knights of yore and deeds of heroism. It was precisely these associations that prompted attempts to rob the unknown man with the sinister expression of his anonymity and to link him with the personal life of the painter; the theory that the man was Rembrandt's brother, Adriaen, a cobbler in Leiden, has never been substantiated.The painting is not a portrait in the strictest sense; it was not commissioned, as so many portraits were, by prosperous Dutch citizens. The artist has captured not the splendidly armoured figure of an officer or general of his time but the tired features of an old man, who occasionally sat for him, and the gleaming splendour of an old helmet, which was part of Rembrandt's collection.The painter's tendency to change the normal appearance of people - himself not excluded - by the use of finery and costumes is noticeable in a number of his pictures. Nevertheless, one cannot afford to neglect the motives which first inspired the artist to choose his theme, even if it offers little scope for original interpretation. Was it Rembrandt's intention to portray the unknown man as Mars? The God of War, richly helmeted, is by no means unknown as a theme in Dutch painting. The fact that such questions of interpretation are posed at all is characteristic of Rembrandt's art, in which the material and the spiritual are indissolubly linked.Recently the attribution to Rembrandt has been questioned by both art historians and conservators

34063-3renoi11.jpg	In the 1881 painting The Luncheon of the Boating Party we have the crowning work in Renoir's series on social occasions and leisure. Renoir's old friend from military days, Baron Barbier, assembled the models for this festive scene at Fournaise's. The assembly of people dressed either for sport or as city pleasure-seekers resolves into small groups, couples or solo figures apparently lost in thought. The positioning of the figures gathers upon a diagonal line from bottom left to top right. It is this diagonal that arrests our gaze and leads us into the picture. But Renoir wants a unified surface impression, and so he also ensures that there is a greater ease in the foreground figures and their postures; together with the luscious still-life on the table, we feel we are in the presence of a superabundance of fine things, pleasant people and brilliant painting

07534-31david.jpg	This painting addresses the subject of David and Goliath, which the artist repeatedly dealt with later in his career, with a perfect linearity of means and intelligence of iconographic invention. As in the early Renaissance, David is shown as the adolescent who triumphs not by his strength, but by his power of character and his faith. The oblique pose of the figure (David stands partly parallel to the picture plane) is constructed with admirable skill.Caravaggio has a particular importance for Spain, for he originated the realist and 'tenebrist' style of painting that enjoyed such development and popularity there in the work of such artists as Ribera and Zurbar�n. This mature work demonstrates the fundamentals of his art: an emphatic solidity created by a harsh contrast of light and shade; the immediacy created by staging the action right in the foreground, and eliminating all superfluous space around it (conventionally, David would have been given room to stand up, so to speak); the elimination of decoration, such as colour or elegant posture, in order to concentrate on the drama alone.

39819-16selfpo.jpg	In the final period, which saw Titian focussing his attention on religious themes, he still found the energy to paint portraits. Between 1567 and 1568 he produced two of his greatest masterpieces in this field: the Prado Self-Portrait and the Portrait of Jacopo Strada in Vienna.In the new Self-Portrait Titian departs completely from the scheme of the earlier one in Berlin. He depicts himself in profile, dressed in black and holding a paintbrush in clear allusion to his craft. Around his neck is the gold chain which reminds us that he held the rank of Knight of the Golden Spur. But, above all, the impression of inner strength and self-assurance exuded by the Berlin self-portrait has disappeared. In just a few years there has been a marked physical decline and, more significantly, the portrait suggests an erosion of the aging painter's self-confidence.Titian's late self-portrait demonstrates the same refined use of colour as the portrait of Doge Venier. There is an almost breathtaking virtuosity displayed in the way Titian paints the portrait using shades of black and brown. Only the face is emphasized with small touches of white. No other painter of his age ever succeeded in producing anything like this

21174-roadruin.jpg	Among his contemporaries, Philips Koninck was known as a figure painter, specializing in portraits as well as in genre and religious scenes, rather than as a landscapist as he is known today. He was born in Amsterdam, the son of a successful goldsmith, and trained in the studio of his brother, Jacob, who worked in Rotterdam. Subsequently he returned to Amsterdam, where he lived for the rest of his life. Koninck was a wealthy man, owning a company which operated trekschuiten (horse-drawn passenger barges) between Rotterdam and Amsterdam. He seems to have been a friend rather than a pupil of Rembrandt but he was certainly influenced by him in his manner of painting(and drawing) biblical subjects.Koninck's landscapes are characterized by a high viewpoint and a sky which occupies at least half of the picture space. They are cloudscapes as much as extensive landscapes. He emphasizes the flatness of Holland, a more realistic approach than, for example, that of Aelbert Cuyp, who attempts to make his landscapes more varied by the inclusion of hills and mountains taken from his imagination rather than from his observation of the Dutch countryside. The landscape with a high sky was particularly in favour in the 1650s and 1660s, not just in the work of Koninck, but also in that of Jacob van Ruisdael and also in the etched landscapes of Rembrandt.This painting of 1655 is an outstanding example of Koninck's landscape art. The colours, which in some of his canvases have sunk into uniform browns and greys with the passage of time, are particularly vivid and the painting is remarkably well preserved

21641-morosin2.jpg	The Sala dello Scrutinio (Voting Hall) is the second largest hall of the Doge's Palace. The balloting and secret votes of the magistracies and the doge took place in this hall with the very complicated systems that the Venetian Republic had created to avoid intrigues and subterfuge during the elections and, above all, to ensure that the vote could not be bought especially from the poor nobility in favour of its richer equivalent.In around 1694, an arch (Arco Morosini), designed by Antonio Gaspari, was raised by the Serenissima in the Sala dello Scrutinio in remembrance of the Doge Morosini's merits and the clamorous victories over the Turks. Gregorio Lazzarini was commissioned to decorate the arch. The paintings on the arch, Doge Morosini Offers the Reconquered Morea to Venice and Merit Offers the Command to Doge Morosini, represent an allegory of the election of Doge Morosini and the nomination of the four sea captains.

22957-24ridott.jpg	The scene takes place in the salone centrale of a ridotto in Venice, probably that of Palazzo Dandolo at San Moise. The ridotti were public spaces, usually located close to theaters, where the wealthy upper classes would mingle with the populace and engage in the principal activity of these locations - gambling. Since most visitors wore masks at the ridotto, it became the obvious location for conspiratorial plots and illicit amorous encounters, thus fuelling the imagination of artists in 18th-century Venice: Longhi, Guardi and Tiepolo all painted numerous scenes of the ridotti and Casanova and Goldoni's writings were both appreciated and inspired by these surroundings.Longhi's composition relies heavily on an earlier prototype by Francesco Guardi today at Ca' Rezzonico.

27134-still_6.jpg	This still-life, which was painted in the 1660s, shows a bulbous vase resting on a stone ledge. The arrangement in the vase contains a variety of flowers, including roses, carnations, irises, Chinese lanterns and poppies, interspersed with ears of corn, a stalk of blackberries and an orange twig. To the right is a wilting tulip, below which we see gooseberries and a thistle entwined by bindweed. A number of snails and insects, including butterflies and dragonflies, spiders, beetles, ants, bees and caterpillars, inhabit the picture. The thorny stems, magnified by the glass bowl as if by a reading glass, form a strong contrast to the rounded forms of the flowers with their soft, velvety petals.Mignon's earlier vase paintings allow direct reference to de Heem's flower pieces, both in their arrangements as well as in the distribution of light and colour. In keeping with this, Mignon has arranged the flowers asymmetrically; the three prominent striped tulips create strong accents in the picture's upper half that are offset by the compact motif of the three roses at the left. The blades of grass, ears of corn and blackberry stalks contrast with the full, heavy blooms. Illumination comes from an outside source on the left that lights the canvas almost front on. Most strongly illuminated are the triple-rose motif and the carnation that hangs below the ledge. The monochrome background, which produces scarcely any depth, and the lack of a middleground heighten the plasticity of the flower arrangement in the foreground. A sense of space is further created by the ledge and the reflection of the studio window in the vase.Seventeenth-century fruit and flower pieces are often interpreted as Vanitas still-lifes, in which the transience of all life is placed before the viewer. In the present example, the wilting flowers and the insects which devour and blight the flowers and fruit should be understood as Vanitas symbols. As so often, these references to transience can only be seen after a closer look at the work.

18746-guard212.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve canvases, almost all in the Louvre, which recount the various episodes in the election of Doge Alvise Mocenigo of Venice in 1763. In reporting this event Guardi was inspired by engravings after the other master of the Venetian veduta (view), Antonio Canaletto. An observant and picturesque record of the traditional Venetian festival, which was part official ceremony and part popular rejoicing, this series attests to the pictorial verve of Guardi and to his sensitivity to the most fleeting atmospheric effects, worthy of the Impressionists over a century later

43628-market.jpg	Vrancx was known for his battle scenes and landscapes, but among his most popular subjects were his allegories of the Months and Seasons. This genre ultimately derived from manuscript illustrations. In the present representation of autumn, the painter sets the scene in a village, the main street lined with houses, some shops and two churches. The foreground is dominated by townspeople buying and selling apples and finches and, to the right, a man bringing grapes to be pressed for wine - all autumnal activities.

34949-5oberze5.jpg	The church of St. Georg in Oberzell on Reichenau Island is the home of one of the few narrative picture cycles on the subject of Christ's miracles to have survived as a complete set from the Ottonian period. It was certainly painted by Byzantine-trained artists who continued their travels after completing their work in Oberzell.The continuous painted cycle running around the walls of the nave was designed from the very beginning as a narrative cycle. With a single exception, Jesus enters each scene from the left, thus establishing the direction of reading from left to right. The viewer entering the space will also start on the left side, the north wall. There we have the Gerasene demoniac, followed by the Healing of the Sick, the Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and the Healing of the Man who was Born Blind. The south wall contains the following scenes: the Healing of the Leper, the Raising of the Young Man, the Healing of the Woman of her Bloody Issue, the Raising of the Daughter of Jairus and the Raising of Lazarus from the Dead.The picture shows the second scene on the south wall: The Healing of the Woman of her Bloody Issue.

15434-selvaggi.jpg	The Ghirlandaio brothers (Domenico, Davide, Benedetto and Giovanni Battista) operated a flourishing workshop in Florence that decorated chapels with frescoes filled with portraits. Even some of the workshop's large altarpieces contain a multitude of portraits. They also executed several independent portraits. The portrait of Selvaggia Sassetti is the work of Davide.Many commentators on this portrait observed that the sitter appears to be the same person as the girl standing behind the kneeling girl in the fresco of the Resurrection of the Boy in the Sassetti Chapel in the church of Santa Trinit&#224;, Florence. She is one of Sassetti's seven daughters, Selvaggia Margharita (born in 1470). Her wedding in 1488 seems to be the most likely occasion for commissioning the portrait, in which she is more mature than she is in the fresco that was painted three years earlier

10995-304david.jpg	Having painted relatively few works during the Revolution, David worked with great energy while in prison, possibly using painting as an escape and as tangible evidence that he was a painter and not a politician. A pupil brought painting equipment and materials as well as a mirror which enabled him to paint his second self-portrait.Less agitated than his first effort, in this painting David stares out with a mixture of bewilderment and candour, brush and palette in hand, the tumour in his left cheek very prominent. (Because it was painted with the aid of a mirror, the swollen cheek appears on the right due to the inversion that accompanies a mirror image.)

18388-1801grec.jpg	Peter, 'the Prince of the Apostles', was brother of Andrew and a fisherman of Galilee. He and his brother were called to be 'fishers of men'. Peter was leader of the Twelve and one of the closest to Christ. His life divides into three parts: he accompanied Christ during his ministry; after the crucifixion he led the apostles in their teaching of the gospel (the Acts); according to several early accounts, he went to Rome where he established the first Christian community and was crucified by Nero in A.D. 64.Apostle Peter in ArtHis appearance has remained remarkably constant in art and he is the most immediately recognizable of the apostles. He is an old but vigorous man, with short grey curly hair, balding or tonsured, and a short, usually curly beard, and with broad, rustic features. He commonly wears a yellow (gold) cloak over a blue, or sometimes green, tunic. His special attribute is a key, or keys: 'I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven'. (Matt. 16:19). A gold and a silver (or iron) key symbolize respectively the gates of heaven and hell, or the power to give absolution and to excommunicate. Other attributes are an upturned cross (his form of martyrdom), a crozier with triple transverses (papal), a book (the gospel), a cock (his denial) and more rarely a ship or a fish, symbols of the Church and of Christianity respectively, also of Peter's occupation.His inscription, from the Apostles' Creed, is 'Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem, creatorem coeli et terrae.' Devotional images are of three kinds: (1) Grouped with other apostles, he stands in first place, next to Christ. (2) With Paul, the pair represent the Jewish and gentile elements of the Church. (3) He wears papal vestments and tiara, as first bishop of Rome, or as a symbol of the papacy in Counter-Reformation art. Narrative scenes may be divided into three periods: (a) His participation in Christ's ministry. (b) The apostolic ministry, as told in the Acts. (c) The Roman legends

24806-triptic1.jpg	This panel is one of three paintings in Frankfurt which derive from a dismantled retable whose original appearance is not known. Probably the retable had double wings on each side. The interior could have been painted. The three panels are also the representative work of the artist from Tournai known as the Master of Fl�malle, identified as Robert Campin.The side panels represent St Veronica who holds the cloth marked with the face of Christ,and the standing figure of Virgin Mary who suckles the infant Christ. The third panel, probably from the reverse side of the retable, represents the Holy Trinity in grisaille: God the Father supports the dead Christ and shows the body to the whole community; the Holy Spirit is present in the form of a dove.The Trinity panel is one of the oldest example of a grisaille portraying imitation stone sculpture on the exterior of an altarpiece

During these years (1653-1659), the artist came into contact with the Neapolitan artistic ambient, a world suffused with naturalism. There he began a reflection on the Roman matrix in which he had been formed, and gave life to an important synthesis between the various experiences that led to his artistic maturity.Considered one of the masterpieces of the sixth decade of the century, the canvas is characterized by a monumental composition, sustained by an able control of light.

14935-6pould05.jpg	In October 1889, Gauguin settled in Marie Henry's inn at Le Pouldu, an isolated village in Brittany. One after the other, he produced such works as The Yellow Christ, The Green Christ or The Calvary, La Belle Ang�le. These works showed that he was in full possession of his art, with an equally masterful control of vision, plastic form, and technique.In Yellow Christ, Gauguin returned to religious subject matter for the first time since painting The Vision a year previously. In fact, the two works have a number of similarities. Both are essentially synthetic, distilling the essence of the subject in order to render it as forcibly as possible, and relying on the use of colour to symbolic ends. They share the same theme; of the naivety of the allegedly simple Breton peasants, who by their faith transform what was simply a statue of Christ into a living embodiment of his suffering. In fact, the original for the statue was borrowed from a seventeenth-century polychrome crucifix that Gauguin had copied in a church at Tr�malo, near Pont-Aven. The use of this kind of folk art, part of his repertoire of 'primitive' imagery, was used in the slightly later Green Christ. He painted this cross also in the background of his self-portrait

20742-satyr_pa.jpg	The subject of this painting - very popular at the period and painted by Jordaens a number of times - is adapted from a fable by the ancient Greek author Aesop. A satyr is curious to know about human ways, and asks a peasant working in the fields why he is blowing on his hands. The peasant explains that he is doing it to warm them. He then invites the satyr to join him for a meal. At the table, the peasant blows on his soup to cool it, and unable to understand how this could be, the satyr departs, full of mistrust.Jordaens shows us the scene from a little below, as if it were set on a stage. What we see is the moment when the peasant is blowing on the soup to cool it, before raising the spoon to his mouth. With eloquent gestures, the women explain what he is doing, while the demeanour of the satyr, unable to see the difference, expresses all his sceptical distrust. Beneath and between the dramatically accentuated hands, the peasant, at the centre of the composition but taking no part in the discussion, sits savouring his soup. Jordaens here offers us a humorous look at the satyr's conclusion in the fable, that one should distrust anyone who blows hot and cold with the same breath

42586-14girl.jpg	Signature: Not signed.Provenance: This painting first appeared at an Amsterdam sale in 1810 with the attribution to Jan Vermeer van Delft. Subsequently, at two other sales, the same city, in 1811 and 1820. It was then sold at Christie's in London in 1853, passed through the hands of the art gallery Lawrie and Co., London, and finally the art gallery Knoedler, New York, from which it was finally acquired by H. C. Frick in 1901.Owing to its very poor state of preservation, which has been remarked upon by C. Hofstede de Groot in 1899, it is difficult to determine whether we have here an old copy or an almost completely ruined and overpainted original. The best part of the painting is the still life. In the background, we find the Standing Cupid, which is already familiar to us from A Woman Asleep at Table. Hofstede de Groot complained in his above-mentioned publication that the bird cage and a violin with a bow on the rear wall were completely new. We still find the bird cage. Violin and bow have been since taken off.In the composition we find a new twist - the interruption in the interaction of the two figures. The young girl looks out at the viewer, and takes time off from the making of music. It has been suggested that the Cupid on the wall conveys the emblematic meaning of unrequited love. Only the gentleman seems to be fully absorbed by his feelings, whereas the young woman appears distracted and inattentive. The treatment of light, falling in from the left, is also Vermeeresque

41331-043popol.jpg	"From the 13th century, the Carmelite oratory in Florence housed the miracle-working image known as the ""Madonna del Popolo."" Marian devotion in Santa Maria del Carmine was focused upon this image.This monumental painting offered a full-length rendering of the Madonna and Child enthroned with angels, against a gold ground with Christ blessing in the gable above. Scholars consider it to be a thirteenth-century Florentine work by someone within the orbit of Coppo di Marcovaldo. The style is consistent with that found in paintings executed in Florence during the 1260s and 1270s, when a strong Byzantine influence prevailed in Tuscan art.

As in ""A Dutch Man-of-war and Various Vessels in a Breeze"", his sea is usually much calmer and less threatening to the ships, the vast sky more gentle. Rarely, too, is it the high sea; the shore-line is visible on the distant horizon, and in the lower left corner a stake is ptrotruding as a discreet indication of the shore at this side.

09976-basket_w.jpg	A ripe young woman stands in a doorway holding a tapestry aside with the back if her hand. She carries a basket overflowing with fruit, quite as her bodice seems about to spill its abundant contents. Although the woman presumably is entering the room in which the viewer finds himself (that he is male need not be debated), it also seems that she has paused in the doorway, inviting him to withdraw to a private space.The painting has also be said to represent Pomona, the Roman goddess of fruit. While classical and even biblical references often served as pretexts for including sexy pictures in the seventeenth century collections, there are few works for which such a claim is less convincing. Van Couwenbergh's canvas is an exceptionally straightforward version of a type of painting that first flourished in Utrecht during the 1620s and became popular in court circles at The Hague between about 1635 and 1650. Gerard van Honthorst and Paulus Moreelse often painted courtesans dressed as shepherdess, a bird in the hand or an offer of fruit may recall Venus, Eve, Pomona, or some other ancient prototype, but the costumes, with tantalizingly low necklines, and the blond tresses framing Dutch faces must have made contemporary viewers feel right at home.

30374-temptati.jpg	"The style of this painter of Istrian origin is highly unusual. Active in Mantua and Padua (though he cannot be identified with the monk and prophet of the same name [1437-1531], as was once thought), his work reveals the influence of Mantegna together with some elements drawn from Ferrarese painting. It is characterized by a care for detail, perhaps exaggerated, and by miniaturistic tendencies in a Northern European manner that find expression in a crystalline and metallic linearity. The angular, skeletal landscape, bathed in a leaden light and ruthlessly cleared so that it looks devastated, creates a sense of anguish in its snapshot-like fixity, as if the events were taking place in a human terrarium from which all the air has been evacuated.There are three panels in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj illustrating the life of St Anthony Abbot (251-356), the founder of monasticism, as recounted in the fourth century in St Athanasius's popular book. The first (not shown here) illustrates how Anthony, after the death of his parents and at the age of between eighteen and twenty, ""sold... all the other goods and chattels he possessed and distributed the large sum of money he obtained to the poor."" The second panel (not shown here) is devoted to the temptations of the saint. Finally, in the third piece of the predella (shown in the reproduction), the great and terrible power of Evil is revealed with the worst characteristics of the human race, in all its innate repulsiveness and horrifying folly. Exorcisers appear on the rock, in the form of skulls, and Satan is transformed into malign shapes and ferocious beasts, however, a ray of light descends toward Anthony and a voice declares: ""I was here, Anthony, but I wished to see your struggle, and since you have withstood and have not been defeated, I shall always succour you"". This is the moral of the cycle. We do not know whether it is complete or whether other elements are missing, such as the leave-taking of his sister, the erotic visions, or the meeting with Paul.The Temptations of Saint Anthony, a theme that has fascinated artists from Bosch to Gr�newald, Schongauer, and Flaubert, is cited as the work of Mantegna in the fideicommissary list of 1819, while it was recorded, along with the other two parts, in an inventory of the palace in Piazza Navona drawn up on the death of Camillo Pamphilj in 1666.Because of their style the three pictures by Parenzano can be dated to the same period as the Paduan frescoes in Santa Giustinia, painted around 1494 (the painter lived in the monastery, 1492-96). It is interesting to think that these Temptations set amidst arid ground, surrounded by chimeras and monsters, may have been painted in the same year as the discovery of the ""New World."

07125-1fruit.jpg	The intensification of agriculture from the early 16th century onwards was accompanied by the promotion of the  botanical sciences. These new insights then influenced the 'pater familias' literature, which also included advice on the improvement of fruit farming. It is worth noting that early market, kitchen and pantry paintings (e.g. by Joachim Beuckelaer, Frans Snyders and Adriaen van Utrecht) displayed not only vegetables piled up in baskets, but also fruits of all kinds, bulging out over the edge of the plate. Fruit included everything that grew on trees, such as apples, pears, nuts, cherries, plums, peaches, apricots, quinces, chestnuts, etc., as well as shrub fruit, such as blackberries, raspberries and currants.Fruit was always one of the last courses in a banquet. In the cuisine of the landed gentry and the merchant classes, great emphasis was therefore placed o the more refined fruits: wild fruit from the woods, fields and meadows were considered inferior, as they were smaller and had less taste. Every larger household therefore had an orchard that was laid out and cultivated according to the latest knowledge, where summer and winter fruits were grown that had to be frost-resistant and suitable for longer storage. Similar to nowadays, people valued firmness and a rich, juicy consistency, brought about by hybridization and special methods of cultivation.In earlier still-lifes the different fruits were still neatly separated, and depicted either as market products or freshly harvested and straight from the trees or shrubs, as in Vincenzo Campi's paintings. Later, the motif of the market or pantry with its emphasis on variety was increasingly given up in favour of isolated fruit baskets where different fruits were put together like flower arrangements. One of the first example is Caravaggio's Fruit Basket from about 1596

08975-vanitas1.jpg	"In his Vanitas with Violin and Glass Ball, Pieter Claesz expounds a theorem of his art. The eye is guided to the various details by the lighting. The overturned glass, drained to the very last drop, seems to symbolize the briefness of worldly pleasures. The pocket watch is facing away from us and has its back open, as if someone had tried to fathom the mysterious nature of time. The violin, its bow lying obliquely across its strings, is angled diagonally towards the background. The instrument probably symbolizes the comparison and rivalry between the two arts of painting and music. Together with the book, the quill and its holder refer to writing, literature and the logocentric character of the vanitas.The glass ball is a fascinating, unusual motif. Reflected in its spherical surface is a self-portrait of the artist at his easel. Since he is present in effigie (i.e. in image), the artist does not need to place his signature on the panel, which consequently becomes a true autobiographical document: ""pictor in tabula"" - the painter is in the picture. The reflection of Claesz's self-portrait in his still-life may also be understood as a pointer to the fact that every painting conceals more than it reveals. In its reflective fragility, the glass ball also recalls a soap bubble, a conventional symbol in still-life painting for the fatal frailty of human life - man is like a soap bubble."

It was probably executed soon after he returned from England to Venice, and was painted as a companion picture for a depiction of the Scala dei Giganti in the courtyard of the Palazzo Ducale.Canaletto painted a view looking towards the rood screen, decorated with garlands at the east end of the church, from a point near to the entrance. Beneath the arcade to the left of the nave a priest can be seen officiating at a small altar.

This institution had been started by Justino de Neve in 1676 as an asylum for retired members of the clergy. Murillo was asked to paint three pictures soon after the construction was started. One of these proved to be his culminating version of the Virgin Immaculate, a glorious picture in which the last of the traditional attributes is eliminated except for the crescent moon, and the putti, flutter around the triumphant Virgin, some painted so thinly that they seem to dissolve into the fluffy clouds.In 1813 the painting was taken to France by Marshal Soult.

30414-v_jerome.jpg	The painting was commissioned by Maria Bufalini for her husband's family chapel at S. Salvatore in Lauro, Rome. The commission required the presence of two saints in the lower part: St John the Baptist was the patron saint of Maria's father-in-law, while Jerome was chosen because of his connection with the legal profession practiced by both her husband and his father. The artist chose to separate the two saints, with the Baptist dominating the lower portion while Jerome is shown sleeping to suggest that the painting represents his vision. John looks out and with an exaggerated gesture directs us to the Virgin and Child, who are floating in midair, a position that becomes popular in the sixteenth century.

16707-atala.jpg	Mourning and sacrifice are the themes of The Entombment of Atala, the moving picture that David's pupil Girodet showed at the Paris Salon in 1808. The scene is set in America, the Native American brave Chactas mourns, clasping the legs of his lover, the half-Spanish converted Christian Atala, who expires before him, comforted by a friar. He is not virtuous: he has violated her vow to remain a virgin or die, and as she meets her punishment his lithe sexuality and dangerous power can still be felt. With its wild New World setting, intensely realized emotions and almost supernatural lighting, the picture moves outside classical rules to contrast 'civilization' and 'barbarism' in highly ambivalent terms.Girodet took his richly suggestive narrative from a popular story published seven years earlier by Chateaubriand, who had gone to America in 1791 to escape the Revolution

18219-0312grec.jpg	El Greco probably painted the portrait in Rome several years after moving there in November 1570. Here he became a friend of the Farnese family and thus part of intellectual circles with an interest in the philosophical issues of Renaissance humanism.The chalk holder on the armrest, accompanied by a book with white and red bookmarks, suggests that the unknown man in the painting might be an artist. He makes an eloquent gesture characteristic for an orator.In the absence of documentary evidence there is no basis for making definite identification of the sitter, although many proposals can be found in the literature. The portrait demonstrates that El Greco successfully assimilated the Venetian style of portrait-painting while working in the city between 1567 and 1570.

38079-soldiers.jpg	Guardroom subjects were initially popularised in German prints of the sixteenth century and in the large-scale figure scenes of Utrecht painters in the beginning of the seventeenth century.1 In 1621, the Twelve Year Truce ended and fighting between the Dutch and Spanish resumed until the Treaty of M�nster in 1648, when the Dutch gained their independence. The eighty year struggle made soldiers, mercenaries and members of the civic guard, male citizens who paid dues and had the right to carry firearms, recognisable figures in Dutch seventeenth-century life and consequently the subject of paintings by Stoop and a number of his contemporaries.The present military scene is a characteristic example of Maerten Stoop's paintings

07455-03boy_fr.jpg	One of the sure signs of an early painting by Caravaggio is the patent influence of northern Italian art. The boy with a fruit basket has analogies with a Fruit Seller by the Lombard painter Vincenzo Campi, painted about 1580, but Caravaggio is not content to follow the traditions on which he draws. Instead of the young women favoured by his predecessors, he has chosen a teenage boy; and he has brought his subject almost to the front of the picture plane, so that the boy seems to offer himself as well as the fruit to the spectator's gaze. There is a sign of uncertainty in the awkward way that the boy's long thick neck rises out of his shoulder blades, yet there is compensation in the poetic device which places his weary eyes partially in the shade.Once again Caravaggio has used the diagonal 'cellar' light which was to become a hallmark of his style. Against a near-blank ground, attention is focused on the right side of the boy's upper body, the classical drapery on his right arm and the marvellously realized fruit, displaying succulent peaches and bunches of grapes

31836-rest_fli.jpg	Poelenburgh's native town was Utrecht, and, like so many Italianate Dutch painters, he studied there with Bloemaert. During his life he achieved great fame, and he attracted a large number of followers who used his polished style for arcadian landscapes populated with the same satyrs and nude nymphs he favoured, although in their works the nymphs are usually more hefty. In Italy he enjoyed the patronage of leading Roman families and the Medici court in Florence. He settled in Utrecht after his return from the south and became a leading artist of the city. When Rubens, who owned several of his paintings, travelled to Utrecht in 1627 he visited his studio. In the same year, when the Province of Utrecht made an official wedding gift of four paintings to Amalia van Solms, bride of Stadholder Frederik Hendrik, it included one of his, a Banquet of the Gods (the other paintings were an animal and bird picture by Roelandt Savery and pendants by Paulus Moreelse of a Shepherd and Shepherdess). Poelenburgh became a favourite of the court at The Hague and in 1637 he made the first of several trips to London where he worked for Charles I. His most adoring patron in Holland was Willem Vincent Baron van Wyttenhorst whose collection included fifty-five of his paintings.Poelenburgh's reputation as a leading representative of the first generation of Italianate artists rests securely on his meticulously finished paintings, usually in cool colour harmonies, of biblical, mythological, historical, and pastoral subjects set in tranquil airy landscapes which make frequent use of classical ruins that help evoke a heroic past. In his Rest on the Flight into Egypt the conspicuous foreground fragments of ancient sculpture and architectural remains probably allude to the impending demise of the pagan world and the imminent coming of the New Dispensation

12488-03hair_d.jpg	There is an inscription on the card, no longer legible; in Wenzel Hollar's engraving and in an existing copy in Leipzig, it reads: Also pin ich gestalt / In achzehe Jor altt/ 1497This portrait, together with the Portrait of a Young F�rleger with Loose Hai, forms part of a diptych. When the portraits were still together, they passed on from Carl von Waagen to other owners, until it alone was finally acquired by the museums of Berlin in 1977. The various restorations have partially or entirely destroyed areas of the landscape and the inscription on the card at the top; the same holds true for the small statue of the prophet, inserted in the window post, which, from the side, looked toward the other portrait and in whose book D�rer had written his monogram, as Wenzel Hollar's engraving shows. At one time, the two portraits were considered to be two representations of the same person, namely, Katharina F�rleger. The series of letters on the trim of the blouse also seemed to point to this; however, they are probably the initials of a motto. Today, it is generally believed that they are portraits of two younger sisters of the F�rleger family. The portrait, along with its companion-piece, acts as part of a fairly uncommon diptych; it is the representation of the two F�rleger sisters of Nuremberg.In contrast to the other young woman, depicted with loose hair, this one - an eighteen-year-old, according to the inscription - wears her hair in large braids wrapped around her head, a sign that she opted for marriage.

34291-liberati.jpg	This sweeping, dynamic composition was part of the most important cycle of canvases commissioned in Venice in the first part of the eighteenth century. The cycle consisted of twelve pictures destined for the presbytery of the church of San Stae (its full name is Sant'Eustachio and it overlooks the first section of the Grand Canal). Each picture was commissioned from a different artist, thus bringing them together at the same time as provoking comparisons between their various styles. Apart from Ricci, the group comprised among other major geniuses of Venetian painting in the eighteenth century, Piazzetta, Pittoni, and Giambattista Tiepolo. Thanks to these commissions San Stae became the most important experimental setting for Venetian art in the early part of the century.

10279-06henry.jpg	The canvas with the double portrait of the couple was divided into two parts and transferred to wood.Following his visit to the Netherlands in 1508, Cranach experimented with Italo-Netherlandish ideas of spatial construction and with monumental nudes, but his true talent lay elsewhere, as is shown by the splendid full-length portraits of Duke Henry the Pious and Duchess Katharina von Mecklenburg, which mark the establishment of his official portrait style. Here, space and volume are annihilated; magnificent clothes, set off by a featureless backdrop, are topped by faces reduced to their essential, typical features. The Saxon pricess wears a colourful attire and head-dress characteristic for German noble women in the beginning of the 16th century

15171-coronat.jpg	Central panel (157 x 180 cm): Coronation of the Virgin; side panels (117 x 40 cm each): St Jerome, St Francis, St Dominic, Mary Magdalene; upper panels, whose sequence has not been definitively reconstructed (49 x 38 cm each): St John the Baptist in the Desert, The Execution of St Peter Martyr, St Thomas Aquinas, St Francis Receiving the Stigmata.This polyptych was executed for the convent of Valle Romita at Fabriano around 1400. A familiarity with late fourteenth-century Lombard miniatures and graphic work undoubtedly was an important element in Gentile da Fabriano's training, as is indicated by the clear affinities between his work and that of Michelino da Besozzo. He was also influenced by masters of mixed tendencies, such as Barnaba da Modena and Taddeo di Bartolo, and more incisively by Venetian and Tuscan art.In the central panel the Virgin is shown being crowned by Christ, in the presence of God the Father and the Holy Ghost. The refined and delicate composition is made up of the three weightless figures &#151; which seem to be disembodied in their draperies &#151; and insubstantial elements, such as the radiant and flaming nimbus that supports the apparition of the Trinity. Curved forms &#151; including the band of angel musicians, the contours of the figures of Christ and the Virgin, and the crowd of seraphim around God the Father &#151; echo the arched shape of the panel.In the side panels the bodies of the saints also disappear within the fluid coils of their robes. There is a highly refined play of colour variations among the four figures. The red, white and gold robe of St Jerome and the pink and violet costume of Mary Magdalene contrast with the more sober brown of St Francis' habit and the black of St Dominic's mantle. St Francis' bare feet, an attribute of his iconography, are almost disconnected from the figure. The feet of the other figures remain invisible, hidden by their robes and the thick carpet of flowers.Indifference to the rendering of space and to the relative sizes of figures can also be seen in the smaller panels of the altarpiece. St John the Baptist and St Francis, shown kneeling in profile, are squeezed in among rocky peaks without regard to realistic proportions. Similarly, St Thomas is placed in a narrow garden, hemmed in by the wall and the door which emphasize the atmosphere of private meditation. St Peter's martyrdom, which is not very sanguinary despite the flow of blood, creates an impact by being brought forward toward the spectator

14928-5paris01.jpg	In October 1888, Gauguin went to Arles on Vincent van Gogh's invitation, to try and build up an artists' community which van Gogh had long dreamed to create. Gauguin arrived on October 20. By December 25, all hopes had vanished, all plans were annihilated. There was the often told tragedy, van Gogh's abortive murderous attempt, when he slashed his own ear. Gauguin fled without ever seeing again his tempestuous friend, who was always to feel bitter about this.Gauguin returned to Paris and he spent the next few months at his friend, Claude-�mile Schuffenecker (1851-1934), a painter, art teacher and art collector. He painted here the family of his friend. Curiously, in the family portrait the wife and the children are in the centre, the husband is in the background.Among other influences, Gauguin was influenced by Japanese prints which provided him with a model for an art attracted by the decorative effect, in which the artist respected the picture's surface, refusing to break it by false perspective and modeling and preferring to rely on unfolding lines and flat areas of colour.Gauguin often mentioned Japanese art, as did most of the Impressionists, and he included Japanese prints in some paintings, as in The Schuffenecker Family

21438-lady_gen.jpg	This painting, representing a family in the garden, was exhibited in the Salon of 1742, the last in Lancret's lifetime, and is a masterpiece, emancipated from all influences. The family anecdote is charming, just tinged with humour, the figures themselves have a flower-like charm and freshness, anticipating early portraits by Gainsborough. According to the Salon livret the family are taking coffee, and the younger girl is obviously experiencing her first taste of it. It might almost be her first taste of the grown-up world, exchanged for the doll discarded in the foreground, but Lancret is too delicate and delightful for such moralizing. The secluded garden with its graceful sweep of fountain and tall, flower-entwined urn is decor which almost succeeds in convincing the spectator it could exist, and much the same is true of the cluster of hollyhocks amid which a dog chews his bone - fashionable hollyhocks dyed to suit Lancret's palette

37109-0view.jpg	The abbey of Monteoliveto Maggiore which stands atop a spur of the Crete Senese, the barren, rocky country southeast of Siena, is one of the most important and best preserved monastic complexes in southern Tuscany. It was founded by the prominent and well-to-do legal scholar Giovanni Tolomei (1272-1348), who resigned his post as podest&#224; of Siena and renounced his worldly interests to take up the life of a hermit. He was joined by two other men from Siena, Ambrogio Piccolomini and Patrizio Patrizi. The three built themselves shelters in this hostile landscape and over the years still others were attracted to the fledgling ascetic community. On March 26, 1319, the Bishop of Arezzo, Guido Tarlati, confirmed the congregation as a new religious order.The abbey is constructed entirely of brick, and comprises a jumble of structures linked by three  inner courtyards, or cloisters, of different sizes and with different functions. The Great Cloister (Chiostro Grande) around which the more important communal spaces are disposed was constructed in stages between 1426 and 1443. The cloister was frescoed by Luca Signorelli with nine scenes on the west side (1497-99) and Sodoma with twenty-eight scenes (1505-08 and after 1513). The fresco cycle is comprised of thirty-six Scenes from the Life of St Benedict; St Benedict Presenting the Rule to the Olivetans; Man of Sorrow; Christ Carrying the Cross.According to the documents the painters worked in a direction contrary to the chronological narrative sequence. This implies that a comprehensive plan for the cycle was being followed from the start. This master plan saw to it that the scenes with the greatest number of figures fell in the corner bays where they could be appreciated from a greater distance.The life of St Benedict is considered as a reflection and ideal of the monastic life. The exemplary nature of the scenes presented in the cloister at Monteoliveto Maggiore gives the impression that they were deliberately selected for their bearing on life within the monastery. Virtually all of the community's activities and concerns are reflected in them. The ultimate textual source for the Benedict cycle was the biography written by Gregory the Great in about 593-94, which tells the story of the important monastic founder in thirty-eight chapter

34036-2renoi17.jpg	"This painting was shown in 1877 at the third Impressionist group exhibition. In it, Renoir was adopting the style of 18th-century French painting, the tradition of the 'f&#234;tes galantes,' and the manner of artists such as Watteau or Fragonard.

They are not belong to the St Florian Altarpiece executed by Altdorfer for the abbey church in Sankt Florian near Linz, Austria. It is not known whether this altarpiece was also painted for the same church.Albrecht Altdorfer was a painter who tended to specialize in landscape and architecture to such an extent that these elements, from being simple background decorations, often became the central theme of his paintings. The dramatic and enchanted images that were the hallmark of his style caused him to be considered one of the precursors of Romanticism.Altdorfer's fantastic, visionary art represented the other side of sixteenth century culture. In his paintings he borrows the extremely vivid colours from dreams, the narration becomes impassioned, and the space-time elements narrow and expand irrationally.Particularly noteworthy is the crystalline clearness of the colours, especially the whites, which contribute to giving the story and the whole scene a somewhat unreal atmosphere

14513-lazarus.jpg	There are two existing works by Froment accepted as authentic; the triptych, The Raising of Lazarus which was made some fifteen years earlier than the The Virgin in the Burning Bush. The style is cruder, more Gothic, and the composition more congested. The crowd watching the miracle performed by Christ in the central panel have been placed before a pattern of ogee arches giving on a decorated gold background. The faces are formalized, almost identical; only in the group on the right has the artist chosen to give the figures individual characters, verging on caricature. Lazarus is already sitting upright in the coffin placed in the foreground (St John, 11, 44). On the left, Lazarus's sisters, Martha and Mary, react with emotion. The young man looking at us from the upper left-hand corner of the panel is supposed to be a self portrait of the artist himself.

19153-43meagr.jpg	Art historian and restorer Jan van Dijk found this militia portrait by Frans Hals and Pieter Codde so 'barren and frail', in 1758, 'that they might rightfully be called the meagre company'. Since then this militia portrait has been known by that name instead of the exact title: Officers of the Company of the Amsterdam Crossbow Civic Guard under Captain Reynier Reael and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw.Frans Hals was commissioned to paint the portrait of Captain Reynier Reael and Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw of the Amsterdam crossbowmen's guild together with their militiamen. He was to paint the piece in Amsterdam, where the members of the company lived. For Hals, who lived in Haarlem, this involved regular trips to the capital. In fact he was rarely to make the journey at all. In 1636, three years after receiving the commission, he had still only completed part of the painting. Eventually the militiamen took him to the task. In reply he responded, as the preserved documents state, that it had been agreed he would begin the portraits in Amsterdam and complete them in Haarlem. The representatives of the guild, however, claimed that they had even offered six guilders extra per portrait on the condition that Hals travel to Amsterdam to paint the men's bodies as well as their faces. Hals was to receive 66 guilders per person upon completion of the painting, a total of 1,056 guilders for the whole work. Despite the high rate, Hals could no longer be persuaded to make the journey to Amsterdam. He suggested that the unfinished work be brought to Haarlem, where he would complete the sitters' attire. Then he proposed to finish painting the faces, assuming that the militiamen did not object to travelling to Haarlem. By now the dispute had become so heated that the guild decided to ask another artist to complete the painting. The task fell to Pieter Codde, a strange choice since Codde's paintings were usually small and meticulous. Codde lived in Amsterdam, though, and may even have been a member of the militia company.Frans Hals painted the general outlines of the composition and completed some of the faces and hands, but only the ensign on the left, with the shiny satin jacket, is entirely by his hand. Pieter Codde painted the costumes and the portraits which Hals failed to complete

29419-marie_a1.jpg	In 1742 the Queen of France, Maria Leczinska, wife of Louis XV, impressed by Nattier's remarkable talent in the execution of portraits, requested that the artist paint her first daughter Henrietta (1727-1752). The original version is still at Versailles, as is the replica executed in 1745 for the castle of Choisy. According to the most reliable reconstructions the canvas of Florence, signed and dated lower right 'Nattier pinxit 1742', is probably a replica executed specially for the Spanish Infanta Luisa Elisabetta, Henrietta's twin sister, and sent to Madrid in 1746 together with its pendant representing Marie Adelaide of France as Diana. The two paintings were probably brought to Parma some years later with the settlement of the Infanta in the Emilian city, and remained on display in the Ducal Palace until the unification of Italy, at which time they were moved to Florence.The portrait shows Nattier's ability to construct an image that is something between 'naif' and 'flatterie'. The transposition into the mythological figure, the perfect turning of the body and the regularity of the brushstrokes do not suppress the characterization and recognizability of the face; the whole is rendered with a polished, silken pictorial style drawn from studies on Lebrun and Rubens

14986-2ponta01.jpg	In the two years that Gauguin spent in Paris between his trips to Tahiti he was occupied with a number of different projects, including the exhibition of his recent work at Durand-Ruel's and the writing of Noa Noa. All this left him little time to seek out new motifs, and he fell back on favourite themes in an attempt to consolidate his exotic reputation. Mahana no atua was probably painted immediately after his exhibition and represents a fictionalised version of life in Tahiti, akin to that which he was creating for Noa Noa which drew largely on Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout's Voyages aux Iles de Grand Ocean (first published in 1837) and which furnished Gauguin with ideas for his writings, paintings and carvings.The figure of the god in the centre of the composition, around which the work revolves, is a composite of Moerenhout's description of figures from Easter Island and those from Borobudur, of which he had photographs. The ritualistic aspect of the scene is enhanced by the use of a frieze-like arrangement of figures and by the work's esoteric nature

18390-1803grec.jpg	Apostle St James the Greater was son of Zebedee, a fisherman of Galilee, and brother of John the Evangelist. He was among the circle of men closest to Christ, being present with Peter and John at the Transfiguration, and again at the Agony in the Garden, where the same three are seen sleeping while Christ prays. He was tried in Jerusalem in the year 44 by Herod Agrippa and executed.Apostle St James the Greater in ArtThe cycle of scenes of his trial and execution is represented in medieval frescoes and stained glass. The frescoes by Mantegna in the Eremitani chapel, Padua, were destroyed in 1944. A series of legends dating from the Middle Ages tells of his mission to Spain and burial at Compostella, both historically untenable, though the latter became one of the great centres of Christian pilgrimage. It is legend rather than Scripture that has been the chief source of inspiration to artists, especially Spanish. James appears as three distinct types:(1) The Apostle. He is of mature years, thin-bearded, his hair brown or dark, parted and falling on either side in the manner of Christ. He holds the martyr's sword. In later devotional art he holds the pilgrim's staff which usually distinguishes him when grouped with other saints.(2) The Pilgrim (13th century onwards). He wears the pilgrim's broad-brimmed hat and cloak. From his staff or shoulder hangs the wallet or water-gourd of the pilgrim. His special attribute, the scallop shell, appears on his hat or cloak, or on the wallet.(3) The Knight and Patron Saint of Spain. He is mounted on horseback holding a standard, and is dressed as a pilgrim or wears armour. His horse tramples the Saracen under its hooves.James' inscriptions are, from the Apostles' Creed: 'Qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine'; from the Epistle of James (1 : 19) (modified): 'Omnis homo velox est' - `Let every man be swift (to hear)'.Apostle St James the Greater and SpainThe many Spanish legends about him, some of which are represented in painting, date from about the 10th century and were probably promulgated in order to encourage pilgrimage to Compostella. One tells of his evangelizing mission to Spain after Christ's Ascension. In Saragossa the Virgin appeared to him in a vision, seated on top of a pillar of jasper, and commanded him to build a chapel on the spot, a story that served to explain the foundation of the church of Nuestra Se&#241;ora del Pilar. On his return to Jerusalem he converted and baptized a magician, Hermogenes, after each had tested his powers on the other, rather in the manner of the apostle Peter and Simon Magus. After James' execution his disciples took his body back to Spain and, guided by an angel, landed at Padron in Galicia. Near here, in the palace of a pagan woman, Lupa, who was converted to Christianity by several miraculous occurrences, James was buried. His supposed tomb was discovered in about the 9th century and the place was called Santiago (St James) de Compostella. It was well-established as a place of pilgrimage by the 11th century, next in importance to Jerusalem and Rome. The origin of the scallop shell as the badge of the pilgrim to Compostella is open to more than one explanation

10175-2judith2.jpg	The Jagdschloss Grunewald is a relatively modest hunting lodge in Berlin begun by the Kurf�rst Joachim II of Brandenburg in the early sixteenth century. It is located in the woods, close to the city's suburbs. Many Dutch, Flemish, and German painting - mostly dating between the sixteenth and early eighteenth centuries - decorates the building. One of these paintings is Cranach's Judith Victorious, which shows a lighthearted heroine.There are other version of this subject, among them one in Kassel. Comparing the two, the Berlin Judith seems more coquettish, she is turned further to the left and looks at the viewer through the corners of her eyes.

34970-2mustai5.jpg	The best preserved Carolingian fresco cycle can be found in a remote valley in Graub�nden, in the monastery church of M�stair. The church is dedicated to St John the Baptist, and it is generally believed to have been founded by in about 790, and probably by Charlemagne. One can assume that the frescoes were painted soon after the completion of the monastery church. Located in the apses, the paintings remained undiscovered until 1896 and were finally completely uncovered by 1950. The apses and the eastern wall had been painted over in the twelfth century by artists belonging to the School of Salzburg. These Romanesque frescoes show a variety of biblical themes including scenes from the life of St John the Baptist.The frescoes in the central apse show St John's martyrdom. He was decapitated and his head offered at a banquet hosted by King Herod. The upside down figure is Salome dancing. The following scene depicts St John's burial.The geometric patterns resemble those found in Italian churches with Byzantine influences such as in Ravenna

39722-3dian_a.jpg	In his later career Titian, like Veronese, developed a greater seriousness and expressive intensity, not only in his religious works, but also in his pagan mythologies. The painting Diana and Actaeon was painted as part of a series of six large mythological canvases {or poesie as Titian called them) for the principal patron of his final years, King Philip II of Spain. A very general theme underlying the series is that of the loves of the Olympian gods, and of the usually tragic circumstances for any mortals who become involved with them. The principal literary source for the paintings is Ovid's Metamorphoses, the most popular work of classical literature in the Italian Renaissance. In Diana and Actaeon, the huntsman Actaeon unwittingly enters the secret glade where the goddess Diana and her nymphs are bathing by a fountain. Diana, goddess of the hunt and the moon (hence the crescent in her jewelled headdress) was also a severe guardian of chastity, and was outraged by this intrusion. As every Renaissance viewer would have known, she immediately exacted punishment by transforming Actaeon into a stag, whereupon he was chased by his own hounds and torn to pieces.This cruel story was chosen for his patron by Titian himself, certainly in large part for the opportunities it presented for the extensive display of female nudity. In the 1550s Philip was still a young man with presumably normal sexual appetites, and the attraction of the subject was that it invited the male spectator to share Actaeon's experience by the fountain, without sharing the terrible consequences. However, the new climate of religious severity, towards which Philip actively contributed in his role as Most Catholic King, made erotic subject matter more problematic than it had been when Titian painted the Venus Anadyomene forty years earlier

03734-cornaro.jpg	This portrait shows the widow of the Cypriot king, James Lusignan II. The Latin text in the upper left corner states the names of the subject of the painting and the painter.Caterina Cornaro, a Venetian lady of noble birth and widow of the King of Cyprus, abdicated her kingdom in favour of the Republic of Venice in 1489. From that time onwards she lived in seclusion at Asolo, in the neighbourhood of Venice. Gentile Bellini, who followed events in the life of Venice as faithfully as any chronicler, painted a likeness of the ex-Queen on more than one occasion. In his great composition painted in 1500, The Miracle of the True Cross (Accademia, Venice), she is seen kneeling on the left, her face in profile and her posture almost the same as in the Budapest picture. In both paintings she is wearing the same dress and it is almost certain that the half-length portrait was painted from the life during that same year. It is one of the most important works by Gentile Bellini and especially notable as an example of an Italian portrait of the fifteenth century - a time when portraiture was just developing in that country.The painting represents an interesting transitional stage between the fifteenth-century approach and the way of representing the human figure typical of the Renaissance. The artist paid great attention to detail, recording every wrinkle on the face and minutely copying the pattern of the garment. But his intention went beyond the reproduction of life-like details: he tried to summarize the physical realities, creating a work of art which would reveal the character and personality of the sitter. Gentile Bellini's greatest gift, from which comes the strength of his work, was an objective and sober clear-sightedness. This is what made him one of the most sought-after painters of his time; the Signoria of Venice overwhelmed him with official commissions, the Emperor made him a nobleman and he was also greatly favoured by Sultan Mehmet II, whose portrait he painted in Constantinople between 1479 and 1481

00323-1poggio.jpg	The twenty-five-year old Ottaviano de' Medici, on behalf of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X, commissioned Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio and Pontormo for decorations celebrating the pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, and other family members inside the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521. Pontormo was the only one to have finished his lunette fresco, frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto on the long walls were partially incomplete. The decoration was completed by Alessandro Allori in 1578-82, a commission of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici.Allori first completed the existing parts of the frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto together with those he planned, then he painted two large scenes, The Banquet of Syphax on the long wall containing Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome, and Titus Quinctius Flamininus's Speech before the Achaeans on the long wall containing Andrea del Sarto's Triumph of Caesar. In both scenes Allori placed the events in a large columned hall that opens up onto a landscape.Finally, he painted the lunette on the wall opposite to Pontormo's lunette. It is a formal pendant to Pontormo's work, he took over the horizontal articulation, the number of figures, even the colours of their garments. The theme of the lunette is Hercules and Fortuna beneath the Tree of the Hesperides.The picture shows the long wall with Allori's The Banquet of Syphax and Franciabigio's The Return of Cicero to Rome, as well as the wall with Pontormo's lunette

20372-13ingres.jpg	In portrait painting Ingres surpassed all his contemporaries. He could combine realistic exactitude with psychological insight, but still remain the sober observer, not involved in the inner life of his subjects. He could paint old men with the same supreme ease as young princesses, and capture the critical eyes of fellow painters as exactly as the dignity of political office, as in the portrait of Louis-Fran�ois Bertin (1766-1841), one of the leading personalities between the July monarchy and the Second Empire. He established the Journal des D�bats which supported the policy of Louis-Philippe. As a portrait painter, Ingres has often been compared to Holbein, and in portraiture particularly the severity of line and exactitude of detail so typical of Neoclassicism often lend the subject a touch of special historical dignity

44743-portlady.jpg	"Jacopo Zucchi was an assistant to Giorgio Vasari, whose style he initially copied. In Rome, the light-dark painting of Caravaggio impressed him, while compositional solutions can in part be traced to Bartholomeus Spranger, who was resident in Rome.This painting is an example of the Flemish-influenced style of portraiture of the second half of the sixteenth century that was dubbed the ""international court style"". Formerly given to Pulzone, the painting was attributed to Zucchi in 1974. It probably depicts Clelia Farnese, the illegitimate daughter of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (b. 1556) who married Gian Giorgio Cesarini in 1570 and, when widowed shortly thereafter, Marco Pio di Savoia. Famous for her beauty, she was also the lover of Cardinal Ferdinando de' Medici. The large golden necklace that the young woman wears bears both the heraldic lily of the Farnese family and the bear, the heraldic device of the Cesarini. Thus while the portrait functions as a record of Clelia's features, it is more than anything else a socially coded message of status.An autograph replica in a larger format was once in the Poggi collection in Rome and a portrait with similar iconography exists in the Spark collection in New York. The latter work shows a young woman with a different costume, but a similar hairstyle and the same precision in the rendering of the details of jewels and lace. The hypothesis has been advanced that Zucchi's two paintings, The Age of Gold and The Age of Silver (Uffizi Gallery, Florence) might be connected to the Palazzo Barberini painting and the Spark portrait. According to the theory, the allegorical panels may have been carried out for Cardinal de' Medici as covers to these two portraits of his lover. Zucchi would paint Clelia again on another occasion, depicting her as St Helen in his canvas of the Exaltation of the Cross in the Roman church of Santo Spirito in Sassia"

00646-caiano.jpg	"The twenty-five-year old Ottaviano de' Medici, on behalf of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X, commissioned Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio and Pontormo for decorations celebrating the pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, and other family members inside the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521. Pontormo was the only one to have finished his lunette fresco, frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto on the long walls were partially incomplete. The decoration was completed by Alessandro Allori in 1578-82, a commission of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici.The Triumph of Caesar is located on one of the long walls of the Salone. It presents an interlocking of Roman and Medicean history such as the return of Cosimo de' Medici from exile in 1434 or the donation of the Sultan of Egypt to the Florentines in 1487 of a menagerie of exotic animals. The figure in a red toga and blue cloak sitting on a marble throne is clearly identified as Caesar by his laurel wreath. Several  older men are standing or kneeling before him, pointing to the men bearing animals and vases at the left edge of the painting.This fresco, no less than the other frescoes in the main hall of the Villa Medici at Poggio a Caiano, is brilliantly sensitive to its setting, which accounts for the angle and height of viewing and the open lighting.In 1582 Alessandro Allori added several details to the right-hand part of the picture. The original edge of the frame ran immediately behind the figure of Caesar, and his elbow extended over the frame. The parts to the right of that and the putto were added by Allori, who signed the fresco under the putto: ""Anno Domini MDXXI Andreas Sartius pingebat et A.D. MDLXXXII Alexander Allorius sequebatur."

10942-catherin.jpg	Comparable with Italian Sacra Conversazione compositions from around 1500, David's panel is characterized by a happy balance between stillness and movement, between space and plane, and between the overall homogeneity of the composition and the careful execution of its details.The starting-point for the present picture was probably Jan van Eyck's Virgin and Child and Canon van der Paele. Here, however, the arrangement of the figures in a concave curve is freer, the anatomical detail more animated. The kneeling donor, with his powerful plastic modelling and portrait-like features, is set against the aristocratically refined figures of the saints. The facial types employed for the women recall Hans Memling, whose leading position in Bruges painting was inherited by David.The painter renounces virtually all movement. St Catherine, identified as a princess by her crown, turns shyly towards Christ, who places a ring on her finger. The exquisite execution of details - accessories, clothes, the carpet hanging behind the Virgin and the still-lifes of flowers on either side of the throne once again points to the influence of Jan van Eyck. A tendency towards multiplicity and diversity is evinced by the townscape seen over the city wall, where secular buildings are combined with grandiose civic architecture in what were then modern architectural forms. The lower storeys of the tower possibly contain a reference to the belfry in Bruges

03743-miracl2.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezi�res, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them: we notice immediately the basic difference between the archaic choice of images, sometimes portrayed purely as a sort of inventory, offered by the older artists and the new, lively depictions of the city painted by Carpaccio.Gentile Bellini painted three of the teleri, the second being the Miracle of the Cross recovered from the canal of S. Lorenzo. According to legend the miraculous event took place between 1370 and 1382 during the annual procession when the relic of the Holy Cross was carried from the Scuola to the church of San Lorenzo. When the procession was crossing the bridge in front of the church of S. Lorenzo the relic was pushed into the waters of the canal by the crowd. The relic floated, miraculously eluding the grasp of all the faithful who dived into the canal to save it; all except Andrea Vendramin, the Grand Guardian of the Scuola.The scene is registered with documentary fidelity but is seen as though through a watery light. The same rarified atmosphere overlays both participant in the event and the spectators of the miracle who include real contemporary figures: Caterina Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus, is the first of the ladies kneeling on the stage on the left, and in the group of gentlemen on the right Gentile included portraits of himself and his brother Giovanni. Incomparable fifteenth century Venice then, with its buildings decorated with highly coloured frescoes and painted plaster work, with its round chimney-pots and equally characteristic jutting grills, provides a colourful and poetically archaic setting for the event. And the many characters who people the picture seem to be participants in a scene of enchantment, inhabiting a magically still atmosphere, figures set in relief against the deep green of the waters of the canal frozen forever in this moment of time

39757-07flora.jpg	This is one of Titian's most beautiful works, which, in the warm and impassioned intensity of the colour, sums up the youthful period of Titian. The beautiful woman carrying flowers is thought to be Flora, the classical goddess of flowers and spring. The title of Flora goes back to an engraving which was made from the picture in the 17th century by Sandrart. This painting is one of the first of a series of portraits of ideal female beauty that Titian painted. The sheen of her reddish golden hair, the soft hue of her skin, and the just visible breast whose bareness is skillfully emphasized by her hand and the pink brocade, display Titian's abilities as a subtle colourist and his sure feeling for sensuality.In the 17th century, the Flora came to the Netherlands and inspired Rembrandt to paint his wife Saskia in the same guise, albeit less scantily clad

26732-lu14ami.jpg	""" Abraham begat Isaac. Isaac begat7 Jacob. Jacob begat Judah and his brothers. Judah begat Phares and Serah by Thamar. Phares begat Esron. Esron begat Aram. Aram begat Amminadab. Amminadab begat Nahshon."" (Matthew 1:2-4)There are only two figures, both of young people, in the lunette of Amminadab, the prince of the Levites, opposite the one of Nahshon. The man on the left is depicted frontally, sitting bolt upright with his feet together, his forearms resting on his legs, and his hands tightly intertwined, a gesture that seems to betray great interior tension, as does the expression on his face, with its strongly pronounced lineaments under wiry hair held down with a white scarf. He is wearing a pale green cloak with reddish-orange shadows and tight gray-blue hose. From his ears hang two metal earrings of different shapes.Like that of Amminadab, and many other figures in the lunettes painted at the end of the second phase of the frescoing of the vault, the position of the woman is uncommon, and was probably drawn from life. She is depicted seated, but turning around, her limbs twisted, and busy drawing an ivory comb through the long blond hair hanging down from her inclined head. The interplay of light and shade lends remarkable vivacity and immediacy to the figure. It is rendered with notable variations in tone on her face, her arm raised in front of her, her hand with the comb, and the foreshortened one holding up her hair, and also over the whole surface of the long rose red tunic and the white cloth spread over her knees"

39399-4massac.jpg	This is a violently dramatic, cruel scene, every figurative borrowing from Michelangelo, from Raphael and from the Mannerist sculptors, in particular from Giambologna, is transferred and absorbed in a new image of Tintoretto's vision of harmonious dramatic force.With intense inner involvement, Tintoretto presents a picture of masculine brutality and feminine courage. As always, he uses not faces but bodies, draperies, lighting, colour, and artistic technique to convey expression. The dreadful marks on the ramp of the stairway, for instance, appear as if painted in real blood. The glance of the woman at the lower edge of the picture suggests that her right arm, cut short by the edge of the picture itself, was once stretched out into the viewer's own world in a plea for help. To achieve this literally gripping effect, Tintoretto may have attached an arm made of plaster or stucco to the picture, as many Baroque painters later did.On the left a high wall blocks all means of escape; on the right in the background a portico can be glimpsed which opens onto a wooded landscape where the cruel massacre continues. All the details are of epic expressive violence and some attain high points of poetic effectiveness

In 1660 she married her cousin Philips III Doublet, Heer van St. Anneland and Moggershil (1633-1707) who like his father and his father-in-law, held high office in the United Provinces, and was a patron of the arts, and was influential in the spread of French taste in The Netherlands.

00002-j_couple.jpg	At the end of the 16th century the court of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague was one of the most important art and cultural centre of Europe. The Emperor gathered together important artists: painters, sculptors, goldsmiths, who developed a characteristic style as important as that of the Fontainebleau school flowered at the same period in France. One component of the Rudolphean style was the painting of the Flemish Spranger, another the German Hans von Aachen and the third the Swiss Joseph Heintz.Aachen studied in Italy, he spent there 14 years and was known as a portraitist. He went to Munich and worked for the Bavarian Prince.

34402-mother.jpg	Parallel with the series of Baroque portraits Rigaud also produced others of a much more intimate and naturalistic type. This tendency is most clearly apparent in the famous double portrait of his mother, painted in 1695 for the marble bust which the artist commissioned from Coysevox. In this strikingly observed portrait there are echoes of Van Dyck and Champaigne, if only in the placing of the two heads on a single canvas; but the real source is a different and a new one. The whole conception of the portrait, the attention with which the wrinkles of the skin are painted, the meticulous handling of the cap, and the dry painting of the white bodice, all combine to prove that Rigaud was here taking as his model Rembrandt's early portraits of his mother. We know that he admired Rembrandt, since the inventory of his pictures, taken at the time of his wedding in 1703, includes seven paintings by the master and two copies by Rigaud after him. In the eighteenth century the art of Rembrandt was to have a wide success in France, but Rigaud was the first French artist since Vignon to study his works, and the first without exception to find in him an inspiration towards naturalism and psychological subtlety

Neither can the actual dimensions of the hall be recognized until higher up.The splendid staircase is itself an architectural masterpiece by the designer Balthasar Neumann, and provides an artistic setting for the ceremonial path followed by the visitor from the entrance to the Residence up to the Imperial Hall on the first floor. The visitor arrives at the foot of the stairs by way of a dimlylit vestibule, whose shallow vault creates an impression of heaviness. Here, he catches his first glimpse of the brighter area of the upper storeys overhead. The first flight of stairs brings him to a mezzanine landing, where he must change direction and take either of the two sets of stairs, to the left or to the right, which ascend to the next level. Having arrived on the upper floor, he is overwhelmed by the enormous extent of a great room which is spanned by a single giant cove vault, without further supports.

05668-rape_eur.jpg	Diderot bitterly attacked Boucher. All Diderot's fury about falseness, lack of observation of nature, corruption of morals, loses its relevance before the finest products of Boucher's art. His mythological world was more frankly feminine, and more accessible, than Tiepolo's; it hardly tries to astonish the spectator, and its magic is no exciting spell but a slow beguilement of the senses, a lulling tempo by which it is always afternoon in the gardens of Armida. There is no clash of love and duty, no public audience, and with barely the presence of men (Boucher increasingly could hardly be bothered to delineate them at all). But this does not automatically mean frivolity. Especially in the years up to and about 1750, Boucher's own artistic and actual vigour combined to produce a whole range of mythological pictures which were decorative, superbly competent, and tinged with their own vein of poetry.The painting was painted for the avocat Fran�ois Derbais who owned at least eight large Bouchers by 1735

14172-05family.jpg	The Happy Family must have been one of Fragonard's most popular compositions, for it is known in numerous variants and was engraved twice. The painting represents an interior of a room in which there is a woman and several children, and a man at the casement window.The subject and the general composition of the painting recall the small genre scenes that Fragonard painted during his first trip to Italy, from 1756 to 1761, while he was a pensioner at the Acad�mie de France in Rome. He seemed fascinated by the picturesque life in and around Rome, and he produced a series of paintings as well as innumerable drawings inspired by what he saw. Despite its resemblance to earlier works, however, The Happy Family and its variants are usually dated to the mid-1770s, after Fragonard's second trip to Italy in 1773-74.Like other genre scenes painted by Fragonard in the 1760s and 1770s, The Happy Family bears the unmistakable influence of Greuze, the most innovative genre painter of the second half of the eighteenth century

07939-f_egypt1.jpg	"During his years in Rome, Annibale was an enthusiastic exponent of a cleansed classical art. He paid tribute to it in the amazing ceiling that he spent the last years of his life painting in the Palazzo Farnese. On this, and also on the large landscape lunettes in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Annibale was helped by young assistants, nearly all from Emilia, who subsequently established the classical style there that proved to be so successful. Annibale Carracci's reputation as an ""academic artist"" and the fact that for over three centuries he has been regarded as a paradigm of classical style, has meant that for too long we have overlooked his no less fascinating handling of nature, evident in his Landscape with the Flight into Egypt. But the melancholy which can be glimpsed in that landscape, whose symmetry almost anticipates Poussin's, overwhelmed Annibale as a man and he stopped painting toward the end of his life. Fortunately, his true place in art has been recognized by recent critical works"

31071-3anton01.jpg	Among the many works that, according to Vasari, Piero painted in Perugia, the historian describes with great admiration the polyptych commissioned by the nuns of the convent of Sant'Antonio da Padova. This complex painting, today in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria in Perugia, was begun shortly after Piero's return from Rome, but was not completed for several years.The central part of the composition, the Madonna and Child with Saints Anthony, John the Baptist, Francis and Elizabeth, reveals in its unusual damask-like background the artist's acquaintance with a trend of contemporary Spanish painting, which Piero would have had the opportunity to see in Rome. The polyptych is also made up of three predella panels showing St Anthony of Padua resurrecting a child, the Stigmatisation of St Francis and St Elizabeth saving a boy who had fallen down a well, as well as two roundels placed between the main panel and the predella. The quality of this predella is extraordinary: Piero's characteristic spatial and light values are achieved here, on a small scale, by emphasizing the white walls of the interiors, the splashes of light and the deep shadows of the night scene in the open countryside. These scenes, where the bodies and even the shadows are fully three-dimensional, were to set an example for predella panels which was widely followed by Italian artists of the second half of the 15th-century, from the young Perugino to Bartolomeo della Gatta and, via Antonello da Messina, to the Neapolitan 'Master of Saints Severino and Sossio'. A few years later, Piero della Francesca completed the Perugia polyptych: above the ornate and still basically Gothic frame, he painted his extraordinary Annunciation.The lack of compositional unity with the central part of the polyptych has led some scholars to suggest that Piero simply added this Annunciation to the altarpiece, much later.According to others, the whole polyptych has a structural unity; Piero simply cut out the top part, originally intended to be rectangular, and transformed it into a sort of cusped crowning. Once again Piero has succeeded in overcoming the limitations imposed by patrons with old-fashioned artistic taste, giving us one of the most perfect examples of his use of perspective. Thanks also to his use of oil paints, Piero della Francesca achieves the extraordinarily detailed depiction of the series of capitals, running towards the vanishing point. Each architrave, and each column as well, projects a thin strip of shadow into the splendid cloister arcade, which appears to go beyond any inspiration derived from Alberti's architecture. The subtle analysis of the decorations painted on the walls reaches an unprecedented level; yet everything is contained in a single and organic space. Distances, so perfectly calculated, are neither forced nor artificial: they are conveyed by the realistic light and atmosphere

15846-rebel_an.jpg	The fall of the rebel angels is the greatest single theme of the Counter-Reformation. It is a theme that allowed a church in conflict to present its propaganda in the form of its struggle against all forms of heresy. At the same time, the theme of the struggling angel also symbolized the triumph of light over the rebellion of the powers of darkness - giving the painter an opportunity to create a chiaroscuro charged with meaning, in which heaven and hell, the incense of the blessed and the brimstone of the damned are contrasted in an extremely confined space, creating an arc of tension within which the knight-like angel spreads his broad wings and wields his sword in a sweeping gesture of victory.Giordano sets the scene with relatively few figures compared to, say, Rubens' Great Last Judgment. Against a background of deep golden light, the archangel balances with an almost balletic movement on the heavy breast of Lucifer, entangled amidst a group of his servants, his angular and batlike wings cutting through the hazy sfumato of the hellfire. What appears at first glance to be so dramatic is not in fact the depiction of a struggle as such. Michael is not attacking the figures from hell with his sword, but is holding it aloft like a sign, as though his mere appearance were enough to cast Satan and his followers into eternal damnation

42425-al-arm.jpg	During his Middelburg period, Van de Venne painted colourful landscapes in the style of Jan Brueghel the Elder. After his move to The Hague in 1625, he abandoned this painting style in favour of monochrome representations in brown or grey tints. For these grauwtjes (as grisailles were called in the 17th century) Van de Venne mainly took his subjects from the lowest social classes. The moralizing nature of his representations is often clarified by a banderole containing a saying or a pointed pun, such as this scene of beggars fighting, entitled 'Al(l)-Arm'; this is more of a pun in Dutch, since the expression al-arm as well being a warning cry, could also mean 'entirely poor'.An earlier version of this composition, signed and dated 1621, is in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam

17781-510goya.jpg	The sitter was a leading actress, mother of the playwright Gil y Z�rate and one of several members of the theatrical world portrayed by Goya. She was born in 1775 and was 30 years old at the time when this portrait was probably painted. She died in 1811. Another bust portrait has been dated earlier by some critics and later by others. But the pose and details of her face and coiffure are so similar only the dress and fancy headdress are different that the two portraits cannot be very different in date.The liveliness of the close-up view of the bust portrait suggests that this may be Goya's first likeness of his beautiful sitter, later transformed into a grand composition. The problem of dating two versions of the same subject is not uncommon in Goya's oeuvre. The yellow settee appears in other portraits by Goya (for example the portrait of P�rez Estala in the Kunsthalle, Hamburg) and was probably a studio property. Nowhere, however, does it provide a more effective setting than here, as a background to the lovely dark-haired actress

23766-pieta.jpg	Malouel was a Flemish artist who from 1397 was a court painter to Philip the Bold and John the Fearless, dukes of Burgundy. He was commissioned to paint 5 altarpieces for the Chartreuse of Champmol in 1398 and was one of the earliest panel painters of North Europe.This Piet&#224; received its name due to the fact that the Louvre possesses a smaller Piet&#224; of the same style.Seated against a golden background God the Father supports the lifeless, bleeding body of the dead Christ in his arms. With yearning eyes the Virgin bids farewell to her Son, clasping his arm with both hands. Behind her the figure of St John the Evangelist in a red robe completes the composition, his fair head following the line of the circular frame. On the left of God the Father and the dead Christ small angels in blue and red robes express their sorrow. One of them embraces the knee of Christ, the other one holds the transparent white veil covering the lower part of his body. The pale and grey ivory of Christ's body is set off by the more vivid, richer colours of the other figures. The delicate interplay of the fingers and hands is particularly to be admired. The coat of arms of Burgundy appears on the reverse of the panel, and it can therefore be assumed that the picture was made for the court of Burgundy; perhaps for the Chartreuse de Champmol of Dijon

37555-summersp.jpg	M&#248;n is an island in south-eastern Denmark. It is one of Denmark's most popular destinations for tourists with its white chalk cliffs, S&#248;dring was among the few Danish artists of his period to look to Romantic landscape painting for inspiration, and this painting is radically different from the majority of paintings created in Denmark around 1830, first and foremost because it is a nocturnal scene, but also because of the way in which the motif has been treated. The artist has chosen to view the Summer Spire against a dramatic night sky where the moon breaks through the clouds and makes the chalk cliffs appear luminously white against the dark surroundings.Besides the influence of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Dahl, at an early stage S&#248;dring became interested in the German landscape painter Caspar David Friedrich's work and artistic devices.

12590-2muffel.jpg	"Inscription in the top left: EFFIGIES JAKOBI MVFFEL AETATIS SVAE ANNO LV SALVTIS VERO MDXXVI; monogrammed.This painting was passed into a private Russian collection from the Sch�nborn collection in Pommersfelden, where it was in 1867. In 1870, in Saint Petersburg, it was transferred on canvas. In 1883, it was acquired in an auction from the Narischkin collection, in Paris, for the Berlin art gallery.Like Hieronymus Holzschuher, Jakob Muffel (1471-1526) was one of the dignitaries of the city of Nuremberg and was a friend of Albrecht D�rer's and Willibald Pirckheimer's. He had been a councilor since 1502, and was the ""Alter B�rgermeister"" (Old Mayor) in 1514 as well as being one of the city's septemvirs. The goal in this portrait is not to idealize him but to produce a character portrait that was painted with the highest possible degree of naturalism. Details such as the fine wrinkles on his forehead, rosy flesh tones and subtle differentiation of the materials of his garments display a highly cultured style of painting.Jakob Muffel died 26 April 1526; the portrait, dated 1526, must have been from the first months of that year. Even if its dimensions correspond roughly to those of the portraits D�rer executed in the Netherlands, it stands out from these for some particulars.As in the Portrait of Hieronymus Holzschuher (also in Berlin), of the same year, D�rer brings the head close to the spectator, moving it upward at the same time. There is no sign whatsoever of any decoration or of representativeness. On the contrary, the artist dwells affectionately on the details of the physiognomy of the subjects. He retouches the pronounced nose of Jakob in the shape of a duck's beak and brings out the calm expression of the open face, with the high forehead edged by a simple black beret decorated with three golden ribbons: a personal and incisive way to expose the incorruptible virtue of his friend"

32809-37baldac.jpg	The stylistic versatility which Raphael demonstrates in contemporary or nearly contemporary works executed for a homogeneous social environment is indicative of his extraordinary technical capacity. This versatility is expressed in a variety of compositional types, which can range from simple forms to more monumental and complex ones; and in conceptual expressions, which are sometimes calm and quiet and sometimes emphatic.This range of figurative expressions appears in the Madonna del Baldacchino (Palazzo Pitti), a work from the Florentine period. This painting was begun in 1507 for the Dei family and was intended for their chapel in the Church of Santo Spirito. The panel's monumental structure derives partially from the Venetian tradition and partially from Fra Bartolomeo. The Venetian influence is visible above all in the setting: the apse of a church which recalls the larger compositions of Giovanni Bellini. The influence of Fra Bartolomeo consists mainly in the monumentality and poses of the figures. The semi-circular arrangement of the saints around the Virgin and the unusually excited flying angels who hold open the curtain of the baldachin give the painting a sense of free atmospheric circulation. The figures, all posed differently, prepare a complex of expressions which will find its natural outlet in the large descriptive compositions of the Vatican.When Raphael went from Florence to Rome in 1508, this picture remained behind unfinished. The Virgin is enthroned beneath a baldacchino. St. Peter and St. Bernard are on the left, while St. Augustine, and probably St. James the Elder, stand on the right. The restoration carried out in 1991 proved that all parts of the painting were by Raphael's hand, except the strip above the columns, which was added in 1697

10680-pancraz.jpg	This dismembered polyptych formed the high altarpiece painted by Bemardo Daddi during the 1330s for the church of San Pancrazio, Florence. Some parts are missing, nearly all of the remaining parts of the altarpiece are preserved in the Uffizi, Florence.The design of the altarpiece was fairly elaborate, with panels ranged in three tiers extending downwards from the main field into the predella below and terminating above in a series of gabled pinnacles. The principal section shows the Virgin and Child Enthroned with three full-length saints on either side (Sts Pancrazio, Zenobius and John the Evangelist to the left and Sts John the Baptist, Reparata and Miniato to the right). The predella comprises scenes from the early life of the Virgin: Joachim being banished from the Temple, Joachim and the shepherds, Meeting at the Golden Gate, Birth of the Virgin, Presentation of Mary in the Temple, Annunciation, Birth of Christ. (The sixth panel in the narrative sequence, the Marriage of the Virgin is in the Royal Collection, Windsor.)The scale of the altarpiece was no doubt inspired by the multi-tiered high altarpieces painted by the Sienese artist, Ugolino di Nerio, for the churches of Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce, Florence, both of which can be dated before the San Pancrazio altarpiece.It is apparent that the altarpiece began its peregrination as early as the end of the fourteenth century when San Pancrazio was rebuilt for the first time. By the second half of the eighteenth century, after much further reconstruction, the altarpiece had been dismembered and moved to the abbots apartment in the monastery attached to the church, which was suppressed in 1808. Shortly afterwards the altarpiece was transferred to the Uffizi.The sizes of the panels are as follows.Panel with the Madonna, 168 x 55,5 cmEach panel with the saints, 127,5 x 41,5 c

29255-107muril.jpg	This is a little-known genre scene: intimate, lyrical and very different from Murillo's customary representations of floating putti and healthy street Arabs. Here the Holy Family is portrayed as a simple human family: the artist shows a carpenter and his wife as he might have seen them at home in seventeenth-century Spain, dressed in the costume of the day. There are no haloes in this picture, nor is there any hint of the schematic arrangement seen in Baroque religious pictures. There is an element of sentimentality in the scene: the parents watch fondly as the Child plays with the dog and the bird. There could hardly be a more unambiguous example of the infusion of naturalism into a religious theme which is so characteristic of Spanish art; there is also in this picture something reminiscent of the homely atmosphere found in Netherlandish painting.

08186-coronati.jpg	Paolo Veneziano and Lorenzo Veneziano had no direct followers even though a few painters of some importance in Venice around the end of the 14th century went their way without paying too much attention to the stylistic suggestions originating from the nearby mainland, the most important of which were the developments in the International Gothic style, particularly in Verona and Lombardy. Thus Catarino, in his Coronation of the Virgin dated 1375, strives after plastic effects of a certain intensity and convincing spatial suggestions without however abandoning the traditional iconographic scheme for the subject nor the supremacy of the ornate play of colour.Though of unknown origin, the panel is believed to have been the central section of a polyptych

In the same year Rembrandt's sometime follower Ferdinand Bol painted Gaius Lucinus Fabritius in the Camp of King Pyrrhus for the same room. The huge pictures show the incorruptibility of Denatus and the intrepidity of Fabritius. The former is seen indicating that he would rather live on turnips than accept a bribe of precocious gifts, and the latter is shown fearless even when an elephant, intended to frighten him out of his wits, was produced. The pair of paintings were done to remind the burgomasters of two virtues city officials should possess

39570-08nolim.jpg	The Latin title (literally 'Do not touch me') refers to Christ's first miraculous apparition after his death, when he reveals himself to Mary Magdalene. Finding the tomb empty, she mistakes him for a gardener, and implores him to tell her where he has moved Christ's body. As he calls out her name she recognises him and, leaning on her jar of ointment, reaches out, saying, 'Master'. But he replies, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father' (John 20:17). The theme was very rare in Venetian art at this time. This picture should be understood, however, as a devotional image of a popular penitent saint elaborated into a narrative.Despite some awkwardness in the construction of the figures, Christ and Magdalene fit in harmoniously into the wonderful landscape that takes up most of the picture

07616-68nativi.jpg	The painting representing the Nativity was stolen in October 1969 from the church of San Lorenzo in Palermo, where it had been since it was made. The composition is less successful than in other cases; the contained and pensive atmosphere, however, shows that at this stage Caravaggio associated the idea of advent of Christ not with the joy of Redemption but with a future that was at best uncertain.Under the roof of the stable in Bethlehem, whose side walls are disappearing into brownish darkness, shepherds and saints gathered to worship the newborn Christ-child in such a way that we can make out Archdeacon Lawrence on the left only after a second look, and viewers may well mistake St Francis for a shepherd. One figure, the patron, represents the church for which the picture was intended, and the other, the Order to which the church belongs. We cannot be entirely sure who Joseph, the foster-father, is.The center of the picture is shared out between the figures who have come to worship. The naked Christ-child lies there on a bed of straw and some white drapery. Exhausted, the Holy Virgin is crouching on the ground behind him - wearing an unusually cut dress, which is falling from her right shoulder - looking at the child. The ox, which appears behind St Lawrence, is also looking in that direction. Above all this, an angel is flying down from heaven. In his left hand he is holding a banner on which the words of the gloria are written. His right hand is pointing upwards, as if, by also looking at the baby, he wanted to reassure the Christ-child that he really is the Son of God.

23367-06annun1.jpg	This odd and unusual Annunciation scene takes place in Mary's chamber, represented with fidelity to detail yet lighted in surprising way, even from below. Mary has been reading at a prie-dieu when God the Father burst in from the loggia, stretching forth his hands as if sending down the dove of the Holy Spirit, although no dove is seen. Gabriel runs in from the door bearing a huge lily and drops suddenly to one knee. Mary turns toward us and opens her hands in wonder. A cat scurries away in terror, casting a shadow on the floor, as does the rushing angel.The Recanati Annunciation is one of Lotto's best-loved works, above all for its refreshingly original and unrhetorical treatment of a very familiar theme. The holy figures are represented in a way that is touchingly direct, almost naive, and the scene is lent a further immediacy by the detailed description of the Virgin's bedchamber and garden beyond and by the quasi-humorous prominence of the frightened cat.The painting was executed for the oratory of Santa Maria sopra Mercanti, where it remained until 1953, when it was transferred to the museum. The artist had already returned to Venice when he executed this agitated, very personal interpretation of the theme. Although the painting is generally dated to the late 1520s, recently it was proposed from stylistic considerations that it dates from soon after Lotto's return to the Marches in 1533

20255-singeri2.jpg	"Singerie is the French word for ""Monkey Trick"". It is a genre depicting monkeys apeing human behaviour, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild satire. Singeries were popular among French artists in the early 18th century, though the term is most usually reserved for a type of decorative painting associated with French Rococo. It originated with the French decorator and designer Jean Berain, who included dressed figures of monkeys in many of his arabesque wall decorations. The emergence of singerie as a distinct genre, however, is usually attributed to the decorator Claude III Audran, who in 1709 painted a large picture of monkeys seated at table for the Ch&#226;teau de Marly.

35208-ancilla.jpg	"Dante Gabriel Rossetti was one of the three important painters of the group of young artists who, weary of the conventions of history painting and genre imagery , had come together in 1848 to form the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He chose in 1850 to offer his painting representing an Annunciation or Ecce Ancilla Domini! to the National Institution (which unlike the Royal Academy, did not have a jury. This was one of the pre-Raphaelites' boldest attempts to revolutionize iconography by means of an unusual setting  (the Virgin is on a bed rather than at her prie-dieu) and above all by means of a symbolic treatment of colour, with a predominance of White as the sign of virginity and a small number of notes of primary colours (blue, associated with the Virgin, the red of Christ's blood, and a faintly coppery yellow-gold in the Virgin's auburn hair.

21026-schout.jpg	In his group portraits de Keyser follows the Amsterdam tradition of showing civic guards standing full-length. The result is not very satisfactorily. He is more original and successful in his small scale, full-length portraits of one or two figures in interiors surrounded by objects that allude to their interests and achievements. His masterwork in this branch of genre-like portraiture, which he principally formulated and popularized, is Constantijn Huygens and his Clerk dated 1627.In addition to portraits, de Keyser's oeuvre includes religious and mythological subjects. During the 1640s and 1650s he was active as a stone merchant and mason, and painted less, but afterwards he picked up his brushes more frequently. During his last years he painted a few small-scale equestrian portraits, a type that never gained wide popularity in the Netherlands. The first is Pieter Schout on Horseback, dated 1660, which depicts his patrician patron, who was High Bailiff of Hagstein, on a black Andalusian executing a 'pesade' in a dune landscape; the support of the finely executed piece is copper

11640-02view.jpg	The picture shows the general view toward the interior walls of the Cappella dei Santi Fondatori in the Abbey of Santa Maria, Grottaferrata.The Exarchic Monastery of Santa Maria in Grottaferrata, also known as the Greek Abbey of Saint Nilus, was founded in 1004 by a group of monks from Calabria led by St Nilus of Rossano, a charismatic leader and a very important figure of his time. When St Nilus, the monks' spiritual father, died shortly after founding the Abbey, St Bartholomew the Younger, his favourite disciple and cofounder of the monastery, assumed their leadership. Today, Grottaferrata is the last of the many Byzantine-Greek monasteries that dotted Sicily, southern Italy and Rome itself in the Middle Ages. It is also unique in that, having been founded fifty years before the Great Schism that divided Catholics and Orthodox, it remained in communion with the Church of Rome while preserving the Byzantine rite and monastic tradition of its founders.Preceding the modernization in the style of the Roman Baroque, a chapel, connected to the church and consecrated by the abbey's two founders, had been remodeled between 1608 and 1610. The redesign was funded by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese who commissioned Domenichino to decorate the chapel. The commission was completed in 1612.Domenichino was responsible for the design of painted architecture which structures the simple space of the chapel primarily by painterly means. The elegant row of columns between the chapel and the chancel creates a caesura in terms of subject matter. The paintings in the spandrels flanking the choir arch depict the Annunciation. Between the columns one can see into the chancel, the centre of which is topped by a small oval cupola. The four evangelists are depicted in the cupola pendentives, and above them in oval panels appear three early Christian female martyrs (Sts Agnes, Cecilia, and Francesca Romana). In the cupola's centre panel God the Father appears enthroned on clouds and flanked by angels.By contrast to the scenes related to the Salvation, the narrative paintings on the long walls of the main space are devoted to the two founders of the abbey; because of their size and viewing angles they are the chief attractions of the ensemble. The long walls are divided into two stories, each divided by a door into two rectangular spaces of different width. The events from the lives of the two founders are presented in a total of seven scenes. The scenes selected from various sources meant to illustrate the joint activities of the two founding saints. Three scenes are in the chancel, and four on the long walls of the main room.In the painted niches at the attic level stand eight monumental figures wearing Byzantine vestments and identified by Greek inscriptions. They are bare-headed and wear halos. Closest to the chancel are Sts Basil, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nazianzus, venerated as hierarchs in Eastern Church. Secondary to them are the doctors of the church Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus, as well as the church fathers Athanasius the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. The eighth figure is St Nicolas of Myra

09619-io.jpg	"Two vertical canvases depicting Io and Ganymede, datable to 1531-32, are now in Vienna. These were made for Federico Gonzaga, first duke of Mantua. The duke intended to line a room in his palace with the Loves of Jupiter. Jupiter was a mythical ancestor of the Gonzaga family and, in his amorous exploits, not unlike Federigo.In the first picture, Io, daughter of Inachus, the first king of Argos, and of Melia, priestess of Hera, whose anger she aroused for having attracted the attention of Zeus, is invited by the latter, at night, in a dream, to follow him and lie with him in the meadows of Lerna. Zeus, camouflaged within a blackish cloud of constantly changing forms and in which his face and hand can be seen, undergoes new metamorphoses to conceal their loving from indiscreet gazes, covering them ""with mist to show that divine things are concealed in the human face,"" as Ovid puts it in his story.The naked priestess leans against a white sheet and her body and face convey an impression of ecstasy, of pleasure and amorous rapture, revealing a particular capture for erotic suggestiveness. This was what was demanded by the culture of the Duke of Mantua and his court, which did not shrink from the power of painting to stir the imagination. The chiaroscuro is particularly effective, with the rocky sward covered with shrubs suggesting an abandoned place ideally suited to a secret assignation."

02751-aqueduct.jpg	"Asselijn studied for some time in France and Rome. On his return to Amsterdam, he specialized in painting animals and Italianate landscapes, which occupied a firm place in Dutch painting. Motifs of the Roman Campagna, ruins, rocks and castles generally dominate his settings peopled with riders and herdsmen. Yet his works owe less to real landscapes than to painterly tradition. Some typical features of the work by this Italianate Dutch artist are the way he bathes his landscapes in atmospherically ""romantic"" golden hues influenced by Claude Lorrain's handling of light, or adopts picturesque motifs in the manner of Salvator Rosa.Italianate as they may be, these paintings are nevertheless easily identifiable as the work of a Dutch artist, for the genre generally lacks the pathos formula of the Baroque and the antique ruins tend to blend into the rest of the landscape like elements in a srill-life. The genre components can be found in the procession of mules, their riders and the figures on the bridge.Like a piece of broken bread or a cracked earthenware jug, the ruins unfurl their melancholy beauty in the tranquil evening light, recalling the transcience of earthly life in a highly aesthetic way."

38210-boeiers.jpg	This painting, depicting two boeiers and a cat under sail with other smaller vessels moored at the end of a jetty, with figures near a lantern on the jetty, formed part of a rare set of six wall-hangings by the brothers Jacob and Abraham van Strij. Only very few complete or almost complete sets have survived, one of which, a set of seven, is now in the Dordrechts Museum, Dordrecht, and another set of five is in the Haags Gemeentemuseum, The Hague. Wall-hangings became very popular in the second half of the 18th century, when several factories in Amsterdam were established producing these wall-hangings for the canal houses. The workshop of the Strij brothers also produced wall-hangings which are often signed by only one artist, the main contributor, in this case Jacob. However, in most cases the hand of both painters can be seen

05508-temptat.jpg	The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Christ in the Sistine Chapel. It is located in the second compartment on the north wall.The fresco which Botticelli began in July, 1481, is the third scene within the Christ cycle and depicts the Temptation of Christ. Christ's threefold temptation by the Devil, as described in the Gospel according to Matthew, can be seen in the background of the picture, with the devil disguised as a hermit. At top left, up on the mountain, he is challenging Christ to turn stones into bread; in the centre, we see the two standing on a temple, with the Devil attempting to persuade Christ to cast himself down; on the right-hand side, finally, he is showing the Son of God the splendour of the world's riches, over which he is offering to make Him master. However, Christ drives away the Devil, who ultimately reveals his true devilish form. On the right in the background, three angels have prepared a table for the celebration of the Eucharist, a scene which only becomes comprehensible when seen in conjunction with the event in the foreground of the fresco. The unity of these two events from the point of view of content is clarified by the reappearance of Christ with three angels in the middle ground on the left of the picture, where He is apparently explaining the incident occurring in the foreground to the heavenly messangers. We are concerned here with the celebration of a Jewish sacrifice, conducted daily before the Temple in accordance with ancient custom. The high priest is receiving the blood-filled sacrificial bowl, while several people are  bringing animals and wood as offerings.At first sight, the inclusion of this Jewish sacrificial scene in the Christ cycle would appear extremely puzzling; however, its explanation may be found in the typological interpretation. The Jewish sacrifice portrayed here refers to the crucifixion of Christ, who through His death offered of His flesh and blood for the redemption of mankind. Christ's sacrifice is reconstructed in the celebration of the Eucharist, alluded to here by the gift table prepared by the angels

37808-manett09.jpg	The present fresco is one of the twelve fragments to survive from a fresco cycle devoted to scenes from the life of St John the Baptist in the Manetti Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence identified on the basis of engravings made by Thomas Patch in 1772. The frescoes were already in poor condition in 1763-64 when they were restored. When the church of the Carmine was largely destroyed by fire in 1771, they suffered comparatively little. Patch made the engravings in 1772 and removed some fragments from the wall, the rest was presumably destroyed in the reconstruction of the church.

06785-1trium01.jpg	The cemetery building, the Camposanto, near the cathedral in Pisa, as appears today, was built in the fourteenth century. The large, unarticulated wall surfaces on the inner sides were predestined for fresco decoration, and over the course of many decades - beginning around 1330-35 - one of the greatest fresco cycles of the Trecento was created here. It was expanded in the fifteenth century by adding numerous biblical scenes executed by Benozzo Gozzoli. All in all, painters from different generations and varying origins worked in the Camposanto, including Francesco Traini from Pisa, Buonamico Buffalmaco, Stefano Fiorentino, Taddeo Gaddi and Andrea da Firenze, all Florentine, Antonio Veneziano from Venice, Spinello Aretino, a native of Arezzo, and Piero di Puccio from Orvieto.The fresco ensemble was partly destroyed, and in parts severely damaged, during the bombing of the city in 1944, and the devastating fire that ensued in the Camposanto. In 1948 work was begun on detaching what remained of the paintings from the walls and transferring the remnants to Eternit panels. In the course of this work the underdrawings (the sinopias) were also secured.The Triumph of Death on the south wall and the immediately adjoining wall paintings, the Last Judgment with Hell and the Life of the Anchorites (or Thebaid) are attributed to Buffalmaco. Formerly, for a long time, these frescoes were attributed to Francesco Traini and dated after the year of the Black Death, that is after 1348.The theme of these frescoes, commissioned by Simone Saltarelli, archbishop of Pisa between 1323 and 1342, are of markedly instructional character. Pastoral subjects, exhortative intent, and emphatic presentation go hand in hand to an extent found in no other ensemble of pictures from the Trecento

31222-11seniga.jpg	The painting, originally in the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Urbino, is quite different from Piero's previous production.

From Mary's veil, slightly puckered on her forehead with subtle light variations, to the coral necklace around the Child's neck, to the angels' shining pearls - these are all effects which, together with the light streaming in from the window, and forming a perfectly geometrical shape on the end wall, will appear again and again in Dutch painting of the 17th century.The blond hair of the angel on the left, because of the reflection of the light coming in from behind, acquires an almost magical golden glow, as though it were a natural halo
