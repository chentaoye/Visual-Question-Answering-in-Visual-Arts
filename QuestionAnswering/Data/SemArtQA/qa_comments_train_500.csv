05643-allego2.jpg	Although they bear different dates, Boucher's two allegories, the Allegory of Painting and the Allegory of Music have been associated with each other since they came to light in the late nineteenth century. Virtually identical in size, their compositions are well balanced and their subjects complementary. The low viewpoints of the two paintings and the broad handling of the brushwork suggest that they were intended as overdoors, to be placed high in a decorative scheme where close examination would not have been possible. In each picture the arts of Painting and Music are personified as beautiful young women, surrounded by attributes appropriate to their arts and are doted by winged putti, who engage in playful activities

14176-071game.jpg	"This painting is a pendant of A Game of Hot Cockles. The pendants were meant to be installed in boiseries as part of a larger decorative program. They are equal in size and have similar colour schemes and compositions, and their subjects are complementary; each focuses on richly verdant gardens in which groups of figures have gathered to enjoy games in the outdoors.The two games depicted in the pendants were common in Fragonard's time. In Horse and Rider, the players have divided into two teams, one acting as a multilegged ""horse,"" bracing itself against a tree; the second team consists of ""riders"" who run and leap, one by one, onto the back of the ""horse."" Once they are all aboard, the horse team tries to shake them off.The game is played in a garden which is natural, with no signs of human manipulation; its principal motif is a gnarled and twisted tree.The pendants owe a debt to Oudry, whose designs for a tapestry cycle on the theme of ""Amusements champ&#234;tres"" include representations of Horse and Rider and Hot Cockles that are closely related to Fragonard's compositions"

36705-breakfas.jpg	Paintings of food laid out on a table was popular from the beginning of the 17th century. Floris van Schooten was an early specialist of this category. He, as well as other specialists like Floris van Dijck (1575-1651) and Nicolaes Gillis (active c. 1610-30), worked at Haarlem, but interest in this subject was not confined to Haarlem, or indeed to painters working in Holland. In every country of Europe, early Baroque artists reacted more spontaneously to the visual world than their predecessors did, and there are Flemish, French, German, Spanish, and Italian still-life painters who share the stylistic and iconographic features found in Floris van Schooten

08663-12s_pipe.jpg	Strongly and consciously evocative of people are the still-lifes of Chardin like the Pipe and Jug. Here it is the very essence of the objects that matters. For all Diderot's praise, Chardin is not obsessed with surface appearances but with what lies beneath. Yet the objects themselves are deliberately homely; they are possible possessions for anyone and, like Chardin's people, they suggest use. At their richest they are comparatively poor; the utensils are more often those of kitchen than dining-room; and they form in fact a logical extension of the lives that Chardin's genre pictures depict

07906-beaneate.jpg	"The interest taken by artists and art buyers in worldly images of ""humble"" everyday life has always been of particular socio-cultural significance. Initial forays in this direction led to the evolution of the so-called ""genre"" scene, already evident in Franco-Flemish tapestries of the 15th century and in the works of Pieter Aertsen and Willem Beuckelaer in the mid-16th century. Without their example, its emergence in early Italian Baroque would probably have been quite unthinkable. The Northern Italian schools, in particular, which had always been receptive to Flemish influences, for example, showed a keen interest in the realism of the genre.A simple peasant or farm labourer is sitting down to a meal. With a wooden spoon, he greedily scoops white beans from a bowl. Onions, bread, a plate of vegetable pie, a glass half full of wine and a brightly striped earthenware jug are standing on the table. Everything in the picture is homely and simple. The food, the man, his clothing, his loud table manners and his furtive, and hardly inviting, glance towards the spectator. None of this would be particularly striking in comparison with the examples of other painters.What is truly new and quite astonishing, however, is the fact that Annibale's painterly technique and artistic approach are entirely in keeping with the rough and ready subject matter. Matt, earthy colours are applied to the canvas in thick and rugged brushstrokes. The compositional simplicity makes no attempt at sophisticated perspective or spatial structure, and the simple alignment of objects on the table is portrayed in almost clumsy foreshortening. What is revolutionary about this painting, of which several preliminary studies exist, is the deliberate lack of artifice or skill an approach that actually makes it all the more compelling"

23376-13venus.jpg	Of the countless Renaissance paintings of Venus and Cupid, few are as beautiful - and certainly none is quite so startling - as this humorous wedding picture. It is an allegory in which the goddess of love, surrounded by symbols of fertility and conjugal fidelity, blesses a marriage. With her right hand Venus raises a myrtle wreath through which Cupid urinates, with evident delight, onto her lap. His action may seem ludicrous to us today, but for Lotto's contemporaries a urinating child was an augury of good fortune. It has been suggested that the picture was painted in 1540 for Lotto's cousin, but an earlier date is also possible. Venus may be a portrait of the bride.

20190-nieuwe2.jpg	In his paintings Houckgeest chose a perspective construction with two vanishing points: one on the left-hand edge of the painting and one on the right in the picture. After he introduced his own approach to representing actual church interiors in his panel now in Hamburg, he explored the spaces of the Nieuwe Kerk and Oude Kerk for similar views. In all his paintings of Delft churches a colonnade is aligned diagonally with the picture plane and the architecture recedes to both sides. The effect is naturalistic and to some extent illusionistic. He employed this so-called diagonal perspective in nearly all his works.Houckgeest made various 'portraits' of the interior of the New Church in Delft, all of which include depictions of the tomb of Willem I of Orange, known as William the Silent. In this painting the impressive monument stands modestly amidst a forest of pillars, the surroundings being accentuated by the bright light more than the tomb.The painting is signed in monogram and dated lower right, on the nearest column base: GH 16(51)

43777-12festiv.jpg	Set in a curiously weightless landscape, an irregular row of trees enters the picture at an angle, affording us glimpses of meadows, stretches of water and buildings, with beyond a distant hill and a plane that vanishes into the depths. We see a number of couples, some reclining, some out walking, and a child and a small dog, both at the centre of the picture if not immediately visible. Opposite the soft, hazy trees that dominate the left half of the picture, the right-hand side is commanded by a statue of Venus, who has confiscated a quiver full of arrows from her son, Cupid.A happy moment has been caught here by the painter's art, like a snapshot that captures a fleeting moment from the past &#151; a gaze over a shoulder, a spontaneous gesture &#151; and lends it permanence. Yet it would be absurd to assume that this scene was based on a real occurrence: the picture is a poetic invention by a painter, is itself the experience, and not a depiction

17942-scheveni.jpg	In Holland in the seventeenth century it was customary for painters to specialize in one field, or even one subject. Painters who specialized in figure painting sought the help of another artist for the execution of a landscape, while the landscape painter would often ask a colleague to paint the human or animal figures or still-lifes that he wanted to include in his composition; it was very seldom that anyone who had established his name in a certain field was prepared to undertake a different kind of work. In fact specialization was carried to such lengths that some artists did not paint landscapes in general but restricted themselves to seascapes, twilight landscapes, townscapes or churches.Such small paintings were produced comparatively quickly and in large numbers at quite modest prices. It is characteristic of the situation that Jan van Goyen, a famous painter of Dutch seascapes, was obliged to deal in tulip bulbs to make ends meet; moreover, he often got more for his tulips than for some of his paintings. During his youth Van Goyen was the pupil of Esaias van de Velde, and painted a great variety of landscapes in warm, brownish tones. Gradually, however, his interest became centred on the sea, the greyish, cloudy coast and the flat coastal plains under an enormous sky. It was in this type of scene that he created his masterpieces

The narrow, horizontal form and the fact that the scene is viewed from below suggest that this rare representation must have originally formed part of an overdoor decoration in a palace of Venice or its environs. Conforming faithfully to 17th-century traditions, Liberi relied for effect on strong contrasts: the huge, formidable, dark bird and the tenderly coloured, delicately pale pink female nude; his forms are plastic, the construction of the picture with the diagonal position of arms and legs shows typical Baroque animation

25193-descent1.jpg	The painting originates from the church of the Val de Gr&#226;ce in Paris.The outstanding painter in Cologne at the turn of the century, this unknown artist is named after the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece now in Munich, and is also the author of a much smaller version of the Deposition, now in the National Gallery, London. In both the Paris and the National Gallery pictures the scene appears to take place within a carved and gilded shrine, mimicking the sculpted German tabernacles of the fifteenth century with their Gothic tracery and painted statues.This paraphrase of Rogier's Deposition (Prado, Madrid) entirely reinterprets its model. Instead of creating mourners who are rather austere and dignified, this artist has striven for uninhibited emotional expression and a lavish wealth of depiction. With the figure of the Magdalene on the right, clutching at her heart and looking out of the picture, he introduces a figure appealing directly to the viewer's feelings. In this unrealistic scene, the painter does not shrink from making the corpse of Christ enormously large, in accordance with his significance, while His arms, obeying the imperatives of the composition, are of different lengths

05997-family.jpg	In seventeenth-century Dutch painting family portraits were less common than marriage portraits, perhaps because of their greater expense, as portrait prices were partly calculated per head. Their surviving number is considerable, though, and their variety somewhat greater than that of marriage portraits. The function of the family portrait is to preserve memory, as they sometimes include portraits of family members already deceased. This purpose is evident in the large portrait of the de Bray family.In this family portrait all members participate in the legendary banquet of Antony and Cleopatra. The painter is probably represented in profile at left. His parents impersonate the Roman general and the Egyptian Queen, at a feast she organized in a bet that she could spend the largest fortune on a meal. Although the fare was simple, Cleopatra defeated Antony by dissolving one outsized pearl earring in acid and swallowing the drink.Since several contemporaries commented on the humorous but reprehensible vanity of the story, de Bray's decision to make his family perform it may seem bizarre. In most family portraits, poses, gestures, costumes, and attributes speak of harmony, good education, and modesty; the wife and mother in particular would display exemplary virtue. The decadent Cleopatra seems the antithesis of a modest, reticent, and maternal woman. Although her banquet is indeed an unparalleled theme in portraiture, the genre of the portrait in historical guise to which it belongs makes explicit the theatricality of all portraiture, in which sitters pose before painters and viewers in carefully selected guises and settings.The painting is a repetition of a painting by De Bray which is now in the Royal Collection at Hampton Court

18258-0706grec.jpg	The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception is related to Saint John's Vision of the Apocalypse: 'And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: and she being with child cried, . . . And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne . . .' (Revelation, xii).The roses, iris, olive, palm, portal and throne all belong to the iconography of the Immaculate Conception. The twelve stars have been omitted. This subject, related in composition to that of the Assumption of the Virgin, with which it is sometimes confused, was more suited to El Greco's genius, more in sympathy with the expression of the purely supernatural image.

09795-triumph1.jpg	Triumph was the official honour bestowed by the Roman senate on a victorious general, taking the form of a grand procession through the streets of Rome, in which the victor was borne on a bedecked triumphal car drawn by white horses. Renaissance Italy, with its love of public spectacle that had long been manifested in the traditional religious processions, revived the triumph, not only in honour of its princes and military leaders, but to glorify the gods and heroes of pagan antiquity, the famous poets of Greece and Rome, the Liberal Arts and so on.The idea of the triumph as an allegory was given literary expression by Dante in describing the pageant of Beatrice (Purgatory, 29), and later by Petrach in his set of poems, the Trionfi. Illustrations of the latter began to appear in the 15th century, and out of this grew the theme, widely popular in Renaissance and Baroque painting, of the triumphal car bearing an allegorical or mythological figure surrounded by its appropriate attendants and attributes. In Petrarch's six poems each succeeding figure triumphs over the last: thus Love comes first, only to be overcame by Chastity, who in turn is followed by Death, Fame, Time and Eternity. Though a car is mentioned only in the first instance, illustrators of Petrarch came to depict the rest in a similar manner.In the Triumph of Death, Death is represented by a skeleton with a scythe, its chariot is drawn by black oxen

24808-triptic2.jpg	This panel is one of three paintings in Frankfurt which derive from a dismantled retable whose original appearance is not known. Probably the retable had double wings on each side. The interior could have been painted. The three panels are also the representative work of the artist from Tournai known as the Master of Fl�malle, identified as Robert Campin.This side panel represents the standing figure of Virgin Mary who suckles the infant Christ, while the other St Veronica who holds the cloth marked with the face of Christ. In the background of the side panels the artist uses a background of brocade hangings to produce a space without depth. The third panel, probably from the reverse side of the retable, represents the Holy Trinity in grisaille: God the Father supports the dead Christ and shows the body to the whole community; the Holy Spirit is present in the form of a dove

26022-12portra.jpg	The portrait is set against a dark blue-green ground. The background colour might originally have been brighter, as in the Portrait of a man with an arrow in Washington, with which this work can also be best compared in terms of style, conception and format. His half-open jacket has a knotted cord at the collar, in which gold thread is interwoven. It is finished by two flat, gold ends decorated with pearls. The tips of his forefinger and middle finger are pushed beneath the left jacket lapel, level with the cord. One can wonder whether the cord might have had some kind of allusive meaning. The unusual gesture, in which the fingers press its ends as if it were an attribute, is, indeed, unique in Memling's body of portraits. The fact that the man is facing to the left and is not shown in prayer, indicates that the portrait is autonomous

07951-sleepven.jpg	Shortly after the completion of the ceiling in the Galleria of the Palazzo Farnese, Annibale and his pupils, who included Domenichino and Giovanni Lanfranco, were asked to provide decorations for a palazzetto behind Palazzo Farnese, across the Via Giulia. The first room was dominated by Annibale's Sleeping Venus, in which Annibale once again combines his mastery of the ideal style, quoting antique sculpture, with a witty penchant for echoing Michelangelo. The choice of subject was inspired by the arrival in Rome of Titian's bacchanals, Bacchus and Ariadne, and The Andrians and The Worship of Venus. These works entered the collection of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini in 1598, and offered Roman artists a rich first-hand experience of Venetian colour

44724-farnese4.jpg	In the two rooms on the piano nobile suited for a larger public, the Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani and the Sala del Concilio, Taddeo Zuccaro painted a cycle depicting, in a total of twenty-three scenes, the history of the Farnese family.The depiction of events from family history already had a long tradition in the Farnese family. Vasari painted a cycle in the Cancellaria, Rome, and Salviati in the Palazzo Farnese, Rome. Yet no cycle of paintings before Caprarola had depicted the history of the Farnese in such an extensive manner, from medieval times up to the present day.The Sala del Concilio, the room connecting to the large Sala dei Fasti Farnesiani, is dedicated entirely to the deeds of Paul III. The ceiling shows the coronation of the pope in the centre, surrounded by four further events.The walls rehearse a series of the pope's acts that had already been depicted in the Cancellaria or in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. Four large scenes are depicted on the four walls of the rectangular room: Paul III Receives Charles V on His Victorious Return from Tunis; Paul III Appoints Cardinals; Paul III Makes Peace between Charles V and Francis I in Nice in 1538; and Paul III Opens the Council of Trent in 1546.The picture shows the scene of Paul III Makes Peace between Charles V and Francis I in Nice in 1538

44430-marsvenu.jpg	Joachim Wtewael belong to the same generation as the Haarlem Mannerists. He was in Italy from about 1588 to 1590; he lived in Padua, close enough to Venice to become familiar with the Venetian masters. He also studied works by Correggio and the Tuscan Mannerist Jacopo Zucchi. He returned to the Netherlands and by 1592 he had settled in Utrecht. He painted portraits and kitchen scenes as well as subject pictures. His religious and allegorical pieces are frequently cabinet-size on copper supports and are characterized by masterly drawn, highly polished figures often set in capricious poses. He painted in metallic colours and had a predilection for vivid yellow, intense reds, deep greens, and browns. When well preserved his little pictures glow like gems. One of them is the Mars and Venus Discovered by the Gods.This painting has an Ovidian theme. The gods burst out in Homeric laughter as they witness Mars and Venus strapped stark naked by Vulcan, Venus's cuckolded husband (in the right foreground). His forge is glimpsed behind. Hovering in mid-air, Cupid and Apollo lift the bed curtain to afford the gods, and us, a peek at the adulterous couple.The Mannerist mode was  not only about such stylish wit, however. The story of Mars and Venus, however hilariously rendered, offered an embarrassing example of the disastrous consequences of adultery

20744-satyrpea.jpg	"The theme is taken from a fable by the ancient Greek author Aesop. In the right foreground a satyr gets up brusquely from a table to which he has been invited by a peasant family, and admonishes his host, sitting to the left, for cooling his hot porridge by blowing on it, whereas earlier he had warmed his cold hands with the same breath when travelling home with the satyr. The peasant ""blows both hot and cold"". This still popular expression means that someone does not take a clear position and is therefore unreliable.The earnestness of this moralising message appears, however, to be lost on this country group. The satyr's approach is greeted rather with astonishment. The plump young farmer's wife stops eating, but looks like she still does not understand clearly what is going on. Her child is uninterested by the satyr and looks at the viewer rascally. From inside the shadowed canopy of her wicker chair the grandmother bends her wrinkled head, in pointed contrast to the flushed head of the young peasant woman in the same pose beneath her. To the left the composition is rounded off by a fresh, softly smiling milkmaid. The lumbering dog under the table and the cock proudly enthroned on top of grandmother's chair seem equally unperturbed. The very low horizon, just visible under the peasant's chair, makes the country people tower above the viewer, lending them an imposing monumentality which one would normally expect with high-born people. As simple people they take, with a certain dignity, their appointed place in the social order.Jordaens' lifelike characterisation of the peasants, full of insight into human nature, and their closeness to nature expressed in their unpolished manners must have strongly seduced the city-dwellers commissioning these tableaux, who considered themselves as more civilised. In a later version, also in the Brussels museum, the fable appears to turn into a good-humoured joke. There the warm palette and the rich texture have made way for the more even reproduction of colours and materials that are typical of the artist's later work. Jordaens' oeuvre contains various other paintings on this theme, including one in the G�teborg museum that literally repeats the Brussels canvas"

15585-04corona.jpg	The Coronation in Citt&#224; di Castello is untypical of Ghirlandaio because of its limited palette: its impact is derived primarily from the contrast of various shades of blue and red with a few yellow highlights. In contrast with the old-fashioned picture in Narni, only the female saints in the centre are kneeling; three holy men are standing on each side of them. This emphasizes the circular glory composed of airy shades of blue, giving the work a dynamic and animated character. The saints on this picture are mainly ones from the Franciscan order. On the far left stands the founder of the order, St Francis of Assisi.This altarpiece is not an autographed work, it was probably made by the workshop

13636-13ferenc.jpg	"""An Evening in March"" opened Ferenczy's ""bright"" period: instead of visions full of emotions, he painted pictures inspired by reality. The subject matter of ""Paintress"" was taken from reality. Pupils of the Nagyb�nya school  appeared with canvasses and easels in various parts of the town. They were accepted by people living in Nagyb�nya, and  who were even too pleased to pose for pictures  or to help young artists. The model of ""Woman Painter"" was Ilon, a woman miner in Nagyb�nya, who is portrayed in other pictures of Ferenczy, too. The composition is built on the rhythm of shadows of tree trunks and sunny strips. The thick tree trunk steps into this diagonal system with great daring and the figure of the paintress appears behind it. She is standing in the middle of dazzling greens  on the hill-side. Colours of the picture are identical with those on the palette.

It is almost square in format and was painted for the Franciscan church of San Giovanni Evangelista. It is a Sacra Conversazione, its compositional scheme places saints in a way that causes them to surround or flank a central group.

16716-ossian.jpg	"This painting was an early example of the new subjects that would occupy the emergent French Romantic movement. The commission was given to Girodet in 1801 for the decoration of the small palace of Malmaison, which Napoleon was having furnished for his own use. Two paintings on the subject of Ossian were to flank the chimney breast in the reception room. The other was to be painted by Fran�ois G�rard. They were the only two paintings to praised by the owner of the palace, and not without reason. Napoleon was also seized by the current wave of enthusiasm for the prose epics of the legendary Gaelic poet Ossian.Ossian purports to be a translation of an epic cycle of Scottish poems from the early dark ages. Ossian, a blind bard, sings of the life and battles of Fingal, a Scotch warrior. Ossian caused a sensation when it was published on the cusp of the era of revolutions, and had a massive cultural impact during the 18th and 19th centuries. Napoleon carried a copy into battle; Goethe translated parts of it; the city of Selma, Alabama was named after the home of Fingal, and one of Ingres' most romantic and moody paintings, the Dream of Ossian was based on it. The originator of the ""unearthed, old Irish fragments"" Fingal and Temora, published in 1762 and 1763, was a Scot, James Macpherson (1736-1796). Ten years after Macpherson's death it was discovered that the poems were forgeries, written by Macpherson himself from fragments of sagas.In Girodet's painting the heroes surround the blind poet in Valhalla, in fanatical devotion, and ready for battle. In his train we see fallen warrior heroes of history, illuminated as with an inner radiance, and, as if in reward, surrounded by fairy-like floating maidens."

39264-4lastju0.jpg	In the years when Veronese was producing his monumental banqueting scenes, Tintoretto also painted some large scale works: the Adoration of the Golden Calf and the Last Judgment in the presbytery of Madonna dell'Orto are both almost fifteen meters high. The difference between the painters is evident. Veronese's works are brilliantly variegated, but Tintoretto deliberately dispenses with harmony and composure. Instead he favours a glaring, sultry light, in which the tense postures of the figures and the strained perspective are used for expressive effect.Tintoretto's Last Judgment is a systematic summary of Titian's and Michelangelo's great models in a judgment that resembles a flood. The height of the painting and a skilful manipulation of the point of view enable the artist to create the illusion that the slanting cosmic deluge is pouring over to the viewer.Iconographically, this is probably Tintoretto's most complex painting, and it has still not been fully interpreted. The artist shows the Last Judgment as a raging elemental event of cosmic dimensions. If, as is often claimed, Tintoretto ever strove to achieve a synthesis of Titian and Michelangelo, then it was here, where he combines the composition of the Gloria of 1553 for Charles V with the monumentality of the wall painting of the Sistine Chapel. As in late medieval northern panel painting, Christ is shown as judge of the world, with the lily of mercy and the sword of righteousness, while the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist intercede for resurrected mankind. A particularly unusual feature is the depiction of The Last Judgment as a catastrophe involving flooding

35482-21mythol.jpg	Rubens returned to Antwerp in 1608 from Italy, and he brought with him an interest in the heritage of Antique art and literature that developed into a cornerstone of his thinking and artistic production. After setting up home in Antwerp, he devoted himself with unfailing interest to Greek and Roman mythology, which he used for the subject of many works, mostly as private commissions.The goddess of Diana was evidently of great importance to Rubens in around 1615, for she could be combined with another subject that interested him: the hunt. Moreover, this subject was well received by his royal and aristocratic patrons: game hunting was the exclusive preserve of the ruling class. Rubens produced a number of large format hunting scenes in 1614-15, many with mythological backdrop.Rather than emphasizing extremes of movement, as is typical of many of Rubens's hunting pictures, the Diana Returning from Hunt focuses instead on characterizing the powerful, beautiful and pensive huntress. Diana, simultaneously the goddess of chastity, stands with her companions before a group of satyrs, who belong to a quite different branch of Rubens's work: Bacchanalia. Diana's hunting spear divides the different worlds of the two groups And no less different than their appearance and natures are the spoils held by the satyrs on the one side, and Diana and her companions on the other. The fruit presented in richly laden baskets and the intoxicating wine, combined with the lecherous gazes of these half-naked figures, must be seen as an unambiguous sexual overture. Diana, guardian of female chastity, resists. The birds and the dead hare that she and her nymphs have bagged during the hunt reveal them as the conquerors of the pleasurable indulgence embodied by the friends of Bacchus.The animals and the fruits were painted by Frans Snyders.

21152-winterla.jpg	Barend Cornelis Koekkoek combined Romantic landscape with a revival of the Dutch seventeenth-century style, in particular the dramatic mood painting of Jacob van Ruisdael and Allaert van Everdingen.In this painting there is snow everywhere: on the roofs of the houses, on every tree, on every twig. It is cold, but the sun is trying hard to break through. Long shadows extend across the snowy landscape. The famous landscape artist Koekkoek attempted to imitate nature as closely as possible, for he believed that nature embodied the truth. However, his expertly composed paintings are not realistic depictions of nature. He took the natural scenery which he saw around him and deliberately idealized it.

21640-morosin1.jpg	The Sala dello Scrutinio (Voting Hall) is the second largest hall of the Doge's Palace. The balloting and secret votes of the magistracies and the doge took place in this hall with the very complicated systems that the Venetian Republic had created to avoid intrigues and subterfuge during the elections and, above all, to ensure that the vote could not be bought especially from the poor nobility in favour of its richer equivalent.In around 1694, an arch (Arco Morosini), designed by Antonio Gaspari, was raised by the Serenissima in the Sala dello Scrutinio in remembrance of the Doge Morosini's merits and the clamorous victories over the Turks. Gregorio Lazzarini was commissioned to decorate the arch. The paintings on the arch, Doge Morosini Offers the Reconquered Morea to Venice and Merit Offers the Command to Doge Morosini, represent an allegory of the election of Doge Morosini and the nomination of the four sea captains.

03306-predell3.jpg	In 1485 Domenico Ghirlandaio received the commission for the Adoration of the Magi for the main altar in the church of the Spedale degli Innocenti. The prior of the church, Tesori, also commissioned the predella with stories of the Virgin and the great cornice of the altarpiece. The latter had been executed by the carpenter Francesco Bartolo on designs by Giuliano da Sangallo, while the scenes of the predella are the work of one of Ghirlandaio's pupils, Bartolomeo di Giovanni; this is confirmed by the records and the workmanship of the fine, slender figures which are characteristic of him.The predella, with the Martyrdom of St John the Evangelist, the Annunciation, the Marriage of the Virgin, the Deposition, the Presentation in the Temple, the Baptism of Christ, the Consecration of the Church of the Innocenti, had been dismembered at the time of the restoration of the great altar (1615). In the 19th century the seven panels were in the Sala delle Adunanze. Later they were reunited with the painting, which was now devoid of Sangallo's fine cornice that was destroyed in the restoration of 1786.The picture shows one of the seven predella paintings

19409-stillif4.jpg	Still-life became an extremely important and much-painted genre in 17th-century Holland, and numerous different ways of interpreting the subject developed, amongst them some with a moralizing intention and representing a reflection upon life and its pleasures. Heda was one of the best painters of still-lifes of serving tables and food, to which he gives a monumental feel and at the same time a certain compositional restraint, which suggests to us that we should apply a similar restraint towards our consumption of the food.Heda's style is characterized by its use of a monochromatic palette of green, grey and silvery tones. His compositions are balanced and never overcrowded, depicting a tabletop on which various items of food, objects and luxurious vessels are casually but carefully arranged. Pewter (a metal used for jugs and plates), silver and glass were the materials most painted by the artist

03487-miracl5.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezi�res, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them.This canvas depicts the most important moment in the history of the relic of the Holy Cross: the ceremony at which it was offered to the Scuola di San Giovanni Evangelista by Philippe de M�zi�res in 1369. The event, which takes place inside the church of San Giovanni Evangelista, is seen from outside and documents the appearence, today completely changed, of one of the most typical architectural features of Venice: the brick building, fronted by a portico decorated with frescos and surmounted by a terrace with a richly ornamented surrounding balustrade, which contained the cemetery. Inside the church the polygonal apse can be glimpsed, together with tall, narrow windows and on the altar a polyptych which is nery reminiscent of the one included by Gentile Bellini in his painting of the 'Miraculous Healing of Pietro de' Ludovici'. In this 'telero' Lazzaro Bastiani was evidently attempting to emulate the choral grandeur achieved by Gentile Bellini and the fascinating evocation of Vittore Carpaccio. But his interpretation of the Venice of the time remains little more than prosaic and rather suggests an analytical report. The interest of the painting therefore lies principally in its value as an irreplaceable historical document offering evidence of an urban Venice which has now disappeared for ever

05507-sixtus2.jpg	Originally, in the register above the history paintings, the decoration of the Sistine Chapel consisted of twenty-eight portraits of early popes who had died as martyrs. (Four of them, the portraits of the first four popes on the altar wall, have not survived). The two rows of popes do not appear in chronological order, the sequence moves back and forth between the north and south wall to form a zigzag pattern. It is assumed that the papal portraits were executed by the assistants of the four masters (Botticelli, Perugino, Ghirlandaio and Rosselli) entered into contract for the decoration. However, it is possible to identify specific stylistic features in many of the portraits, and it therefore appears that Botticelli designed an unusually large share of them, seven portraits including that of Sixtus II.The portraits of the popes are imaginary. As can be seen in the figure of Sixtus II, a namesake of the pope who commissioned the work, they are full length figures placed in niches and painted, so as to be seen from far below, high up on the walls of the room.

15584-03corona.jpg	With some altar paintings the intention was to venerate the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Heaven, and this meant that the traditional Sacra Conversazione was not suited to the task. In cases such as this the painters divided the picture horizontally so that they could show the Coronation of the Virgin taking place above a row of saints. Vertical panels with rounded tops were particularly well suited to such compositions. Two panels on this theme by Ghirlandaio, both dating from about 1486, have survived. Though at first sight both works appear completely different, both are in keeping with the traditional form for this type of picture.In the Coronation in the town of Narni, the gold background, which jars with the other colours, and also the number of saints and angels crowding the picture, are unusual for Ghirlandaio. It is possible that the clients from the provinces in Umbria had requested this conservative structural method. In both works Ghirlandaio's workshop is considered to have painted a large proportion of the work, but despite this the painting in Narni, Ghirlandaio's largest panel painting, was so successful that it was later copied more than once.In this panel Christ and his Mother appear on clouds amid the hosts of heaven. The angels are making music while Christ places the crown of the Queen of Heaven on the bowed head of the humble Virgin. In the lower register, many holy man and women are kneeling around St Francis and taking part in prayer in the solemn ceremony

26635-03_7pr3.jpg	Isaiah is altogether different in character. He seems to listen intently. His forehead may express bewilderment yet he is clad in the green cloak of hope. As he listens, his genii point excitedly into the distance whence the great voice addresses him. The powerful left arm is raised as though commanding stillness or silence. He has an intimation of the mystery of the Son. The naked feet are crossed, and the entire figure expresses veneration, expectation and readiness. What is the significance of the half closed book which he marks with his inserted finger? Surely, that the book is nothing; books may fail, the voice alone is infallible. Note how the contours of the figure form a circle from which only the head and one hand emerge. The left arm, the left hand, and the head together with the genii, describe an oval superimposed on the circle. The face, with lips parted in expectation, bears an expression of rapt attention; the hair of indeterminate colour, and the vigorously drawn neck emerging from light-toned draperies in blue, green and red, symbolizing faith, hope and charity, indicate that this exalted figure is poised on the threshold of two worlds; it is intent of hearing, it is rapt in attention, and its genius points at Noah's offering.Above the Prophet to the left we see an ignudo with a jubilant expression. He and the blithe youth to the right above Daniel prove that Michelangelo - was he not the contemporary of the happy saint Filippo Neri? - was not altogether a stranger to joy

40930-04wings.jpg	The Mannerist tendency in the old duchy of Brabant (Antwerp-Brussels), had some points of contact with the more sedate Bruges style. It is not always clear, however, whether a particular work was painted by Bruges masters who had settled in Antwerp or in Bruges itself. Alongside the pure Antwerp and Bruges styles, a kind of Bruges-Antwerp fusion can be distinguished, symbolizing the growing attraction of the rising metropolis.

39706-08urbin.jpg	The Venus of Urbino was painted for Guidobaldo della Rovere, the heir of Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. If the pose of this Venus brings to mind that of Giorgione's Sleeping Venus in Dresden (which the young Titian had completed after Giorgione's death) the intent of the painting is quite different. Titian's Venus has nothing to do with Giorgione's idealised image of female beauty, it is normally interpreted as an allegory of marital love. There have been some suggestions that there might be a connection with the wedding of Guidobaldo della Rovere and Giuliana Varano in 1534.This is an extremely fine composition. It invites us to dwell on more than just the warm, golden figure of this young woman with her cascading curls and the attractive, carefully studied movement of her arm. Observe the way the sheet has been painted, with masterful blends of colour, the small dog lazily curled up asleep, the amusing touch of the two maids rummaging in the chest, the world outside the window, and the malicious, but at the same time ingenious expression of the young Venus. There is an intimacy of this scene of almost domestic simplicity which places the whole composition in a warm, human, temporal reality

05065-bacchus.jpg	Bor's early style was informed by the older generation of Utrecht painters, such as Abraham van Bloemaert and Jan van Bijlert, while in Rome he was exposed to Italian art and the works of his fellow members of the Schildersbent.  From the 1630s onward we see the influence of the Haarlem painters Salomon de Bray, Pieter de Grebber and Jacob van Campen, but it was the last who had the greatest impact on Bor and there are a number of pictures that have at different times been given to both artists.

14517-lallegro.jpg	The painting was inspired by lines 11&#151;16 of the poem L'Allegro by John Milton. It was written in conjunction with Il Penseroso, and both poems explore contrasting themes that had been essayed by neo-Platonists during the Renaissance: the former describing the active life and the latter the contemplative. L'Allegro and Il Penseroso date from about 1630 and are in Milton's early lyrical style. Themes from John Milton's oeuvre achieved great popularity during the nineteenth century. They exerted a particular fascination for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.The painting was commissioned by Queen Victoria on the basis of a larger picture entitled Euphrosyne, which had been exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1848. The composition is not an exact replica of the larger painting and only repeats the central group. It was intended as a birthday present for Prince Albert on 26 August 1848

43065-montigny.jpg	This painting portrays Cornelis Montigny de Glarges, aged 43, half-length, in a brown coat and white lace ruff. He came from a wealthy Dutch family, and was educated at the University of Leiden. He was clearly very well connected in Haarlem and Leiden: he maintained an album amicorum from 1622 until 1679 in which friends including the still-life painter Floris van Dyck, and the draughtsman and engraver Jacob Matham, the portraitist David Bailly, as well as poets, historians, scientists and philosophers such as Jacob Cats, Samuel Ampzing, Theodor Schrevelius, Constantijn and Christiaan Huygens and Ren� Descartes inscribed poems, drawings and messages of goodwill.Several of these friends of Montigny de Glarges also sat to Frans Hals, but while the pose of the present sitter reminds us of Hals, it is actually more extreme than in any of Hals' portraits, with the sitter's shoulder cocked elbow pointing straight out at the viewer, while his face is almost full-frontal. Although Verspronck was certainly influenced by his older townsman, his technique is entirely different and much more restrained, and his lighting more complex and theatrical

13893-breadcon.jpg	In the culinary culture of the aristocracy and the patrician middle classes, banquets consisted of six to eight - sometimes even nine - courses and were always concluded by a dessert. Interest in desserts came to a climax at a time when numerous delicacies had been introduced as new luxuries. This was especially true for sugar confectionary, which appeared in still-lifes around 1600 for the first time. The introduction of sugar marked a radical revolution of taste. Initially it was only used for pharmaceutical purposes, but it soon replaced honey as a sweetener and a food.The crystalline structure of the candied sugar was rendered especially accurately by Georg Flegel in his confectionary still-life. His painting shows candied fruit on a table in the foreground, including two figs on the right, encrusted with large sugar crystals. Some of the fruits have been cut up in the shape of letters, for example a large 'O' can be made out as well as a crumbled 'A' beside the loaf of bread. A straight piece of sugar is lying across the loaf like a cross-beam and is being approached by a disproportionately large bee. The earthenware bowl with the blue pattern contains candied fruit dusted with icing sugar, and a brimstone butterfly, whose wings also show traces of sugar, has alighted on it.Flegel added a religious dimension, because the seemingly innocuous arrangement is full of Christian allusions. For example, the letters 'A' and 'O' (Alpha and Omega) as the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet are a reference to Apocalypse 1:8 and 21:6, where Christ is referred to as the beginning and the end. The cross formed by the loaf and the piece of sugar emphasizes this aspect even further. Finally, as a reminder of the Eucharist, there is the bread and wine in the dainty glass, with decorations resembling amphora handles which drop down in the form of grape-like clusters at the bottom. The redemptive work of Christ is called to mind by the butterfly, an ancient symbol of the human soul as well of the resurrection, as new life comes forth from a seemingly dead chrysalis. The heart on the right is a specially shaped piece of bread, made from communion wafer dough, and is apparently meant to remind the viewer of the heart of Christ.In Flegel's art, sugar has entirely taken over the religious connotations of honey, which was understood as a symbol of 'spiritual sweetness' during the Middle ages

15097-kinship.jpg	According to a late medieval legend Anne was three times married and by each marriage had a child called Mary. Each Mary married and produced offspring. This was one attempt to reconcile the conflicting statements by the evangelists concerning the family of Christ. The three husbands were Joachim (the father of Virgin Mary), Cleophas (whose daughter Mary married Alpheus and had four sons, James the less, Joseph the Just, Simon, and Judas Thaddeus), and Salomas (whose daughter Mary married Zebedee and was the mother of James the Greater and John the Evangelist).The subject of The Family of St Anne (Holy Kinship, Holy Company) is seen frequently in the art of northern Europe from the 15th century and shows the Virgin and Child surrounded by numerous members of this sizeable family. In Geertgen's painting St Anne's entire family is portrayed. On the left is the matriarch herself, with a book on her lap. Beside her is the Virgin Mary with the infant Christ.

12412-forestla.jpg	Like other members of the Barbizon School, Dupr� began his career as a porcelain painter, working in the factory of his father Fran�ois Dupr�. Gradually becoming more influenced by naturalistic landscape painting, he took lessons from Jean-Michel Di�bolt, and began making sojourns to paint natural settings in the provinces. Dupr�'s work differed from others' in the Barbizon School because he did not strictly associate himself with the area around the Forest of Fontainebleau, instead preferring the village of L'Isle d'Adam north of Paris, and his work tended to be more romantic.

The plastic values of the painting are toned down compared to those in the copper engraving, and the interior detail is gentler. Eve is gazing seductively across at Adam. In her left hand she is receiving the apple from the serpent, and in her right she is holding a branch from the Tree of Knowledge from which hangs a cartellino, a small inscribed plaque with the signature and phrase ""Albertus D�rer alemanus faciebat post virginis partum 1507"" (The German Albrecht D�rer made this after the Virgin gave birth 1507)"

42835-05helen.jpg	The subject of the painting is the story of the vision, or more correctly the dream, which, according to legend, brought St Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine, to discover the True Cross in Jerusalem. The cross, which appears before her supported by a winged putto presenting his back to the audience, could be said to be the materialization of her dream. St Helena is seated in an attitude of repose, her head resting on her left hand, and her eyes closed. She wears a sumptuous gown, in sixteenth-century style, partly covered by a cloak fastened with a precious clasp. A jeweled crown secures the veil covering her head.This painting is Veronese's second version of the subject of St Helena, and it is quite different from the first version in the National Gallery in London both artistically and in content. St Helena is now crowned and wearing the splendid dress of an empress. Brightly gleaming columns with a statue between them ennoble the location of the event. However, in comparison with the London picture the choreography of the picture is rather superficial and calculated. The dating of the picture remains problematic. In her dress, she seems a figure taken wholly from the repertoire of the Feasts. Only the powerful colour contrasts and selective distribution of light, which resemble most closely the figure of Judith (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), generally dated to around 1582/83, justify the late dating

22927-00moros.jpg	The Palazzo Morosini Sagredo is a large building with a Gothic fa�ade overlooking the Grand Canal. It was built by the Morosini family, possibly during two separate phases between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It was acquired by the future doge Nicol&#242; Sagredo in 1661. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, his descendents commissioned the renovation of the interiors. Andrea Tirali was brought in to design the monumental staircase at the back of the building, which was completed in 1732. Carpoforo Mazzetti and Abbondio Stazio were hired to create the stucco work for the small rooms on the top floor, and some of the most renowned painters of the day painted the ceilings of the principal rooms.For the decoration of the large staircase, the young Pietro Longhi was employed, who completed the project in 1734. The frescoes shows the influence of Emilian painters, particularly Giuseppe Maria Crespi, with whom he studied in Bologna.The fresco completely covers the ceiling and the walls of the large stairwell, extending even to the wooden shutters of the windows that open onto it. It depicts the story of Jupiter's root of the Giants, sons of the Earth who had rebelled against the gods, who had cast them out of Olympus. Jupiter appears at the centre of the ceiling, caught in the act of hurling his lightning bolts against the Giants. He sits astride a large eagle that holds other lightning bolts in its beak. Beneath him, arranged in a circle on the clouds, various other Olympian gads witness his victory

10905-cambyse.jpg	David's first paintings probably date from the years between 1480 and 1484. They reflect a Dutch influence in his early training. Soon after he arrived in Bruges, however, in 1487 and 1488, the municipal authorities requested him to paint a series of panels for the deputy burgomaster's room in the town hall. This major commission took the form of a large diptych that was first mentioned in the city archives as a Last Judgment, but which in fact depicts The Judgment of Cambyses. The subject is taken from Herodotus: the judge Sisamnes, who had been guilty of prevarication, was arrested and punished by Cambyses, the King of Persia. For his crimes, Sisamnes was condemned to be flayed alive. David represents this scene with a cold and exemplary cruelty. Like the paintings Dieric Bouts made for the town hall in Louvain, David's panels were intended as a stern warning to judges against the temptation of corruption

29239-virginia.jpg	The story of Virginia is told by Livy. Appius Claudius, a decemvir - one of a board of ten legislators dating from the 5th century B.C. - secretly desired a virgin, the daughter of an honourable centurion. He conspired with one of his dependents to obtain her. The man was to lay claim to the girl as a former slave and bring the case before Appius who would give judgment in the dependants favour. So it fell out, not without an outcry led by Virginia's betrothed. But before the girl could be led away her father snatched a knife from a butcher's shop and stabbed her to death. The theme occurs in Italian Renaissance and Baroque painting, and shows Appius on the judgment seat.This painting is probably the pendant of another of the same dimensions depicting the death of an ancient heroine: Horatius Slaying His Sister after the Defeat of the Curiatii (private collection)

05249-05patmos.jpg	St John the Evangelist sits on a hill in the foreground of the painting. He holds an open book in his left hand and a writing quill in his right hand. From the hill the view extends across a river landscape reminiscent of the Lower Rhine, but meant to be the island of Patmos, where John received the Revelation of the Apocalypse. An angel points towards the sky, where the Woman of the Apocalypse has appeared. Since the Middle Ages this heavenly vision has been identified with the Madonna. The bird at the bottom left is a falcon - a reference to the symbolic animal of the Evangelist, the eagle. The bird guards its master's writing tools, which a demon is trying to steal. Demons also throng the dark reverse of the panel.Perhaps influenced by earlier representations of this subject, Bosch for once restrained his predilection for demonic spectacles. There are, to be sure, several ships burning in the water at lower left, and a little monster can be seen at lower right, both details probably suggested by St John's Apocalypse, but neither seriously disturbs the idyllic landscape in which the saint enjoys his vision

10702-pardon.jpg	In 1886, Dagnan-Bouveret began a series of paintings on the theme of the Breton custom of the 'pardon', an annual pilgrimage associated with the feast day of the patron saint of a local church.  Clothed in traditional Breton costumes, pilgrims would gather on the eve of the feast day for confession, and then rise for early morning mass and a day of prayer.  Following the worship services, they walked in procession around the church where others who wished to offer prayers of gratitude could join in, often carrying objects such as crutches that were no longer needed. This unique combination of theatricality, unsullied rural custom, and Christian piety were appealing not only to Dagnan-Bouveret, but also to the countless other artists who would travel to Brittany in the closing years of the nineteenth century.The present painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1887 and at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1889

28930-tailor1.jpg	The painting represents a tailor resting during his work.Like Moretto's earlier likenesses of Brescian noblemen sympathetic to the Holy Roman Emperor and Titian's portraits of the emperor and others, early aristocratic portraits by Moroni use the full-length, life-size format. By the 1570s, however, the fashion for portraiture had spread from nobles to the professional classes. Yet this sympathetic depiction of a tailor at his work remains unique. It has been plausibly suggested that Moroni executed the painting in exchange for services rendered - perhaps a suit in that fashionable Spanish black coat proffered by the tailor. The tailor wears a less stylish costume of red and buff, albeit with a Spanish ruff.The realism of the painting, dispassionately even-handed in its description of objects, details of costume, physiognomy and expression., should not blind us to its artful geometric structure. The three-quarter length format is justified by the table. Instead of creating the usual barrier between sitter and spectator, it forges a friendly link between them through the angle at which it is set, and because of the unaffected way it enables the tailor to pause before cutting his cloth in order to address the viewer

39598-3martyr.jpg	"At the close of the 1520s, Titian completed what used to be considered one of his finest works, The Death of St Peter Martyr. Tragically, it was destroyed in 1867  by fire in the Chapel of Rosary, where the painting was deposited at the time of the fire. The painting presently displayed in the Basilica is an 18th-century copy by Niccol&#242; Cassala.A vivid ekphrasis by Aretino describes how ""you would comprehend all the living terrors of death"" in the face and flesh of the man on the ground, and perceive ""the pallor of vileness and the whiteness of fear"" while contemplating his companion in flight. Aretino's description also brings home how realistic and shocking the image must have seemed to contemporaries. Such violence had never been seen in an altarpiece before, nor had any saint been portrayed in such a humiliating position, but Titian's solution is polemically Venetian in the importance of the landscape, whose trees soar and stir in sympathy with the drama below"

21703-4figures.jpg	The early years of the three Le Nain brothers, Antoine, Louis and Mathieu, are ill-documented, and their individual artistic identities are submerged under the surname with which they signed their works. They were born in Laon between 1600 and 1610 and were working in Paris by 1629; Antoine and Louis died within a day or two of each other in May 1648 but Mathieu survived until 1677. All three became members of the French Royal Academy at its formation in 1648. In circumstances which have not yet been clarified, Mathieu seems to have enjoyed the personal protection of Louis XIV for 'his services in the armies of the King', and from 1658 aspired to the nobility.Although the Le Nain first made their reputation with large-scale mythological and allegorical compositions and altarpieces (many of which were lost during the French Revolution) and continued to receive commissions of this type, they are now chiefly known for their small and striking paintings of 'low-life', especially those depicting peasants. Recent scholarship has associated their new kind of realistic rustic genre, neither romanticising nor satirising country dwellers, with an emergent class of bourgeois landowners whose ideals of the dignity of agricultural labour and of the partnership between owners of land and tenant farmers they seem to reflect.Four Figures at Table is one of many 'peasant meals' painted by the Le Nain. The strong light falling from the upper left emphasises the darkness and stillness of the humble but respectable interior - brightened only by the well-washed linen - at the same time as it delineates form, texture and expression. It has been suggested that the picture depicts the Three Ages, the old woman's lined face, marked by resignation, contrasting with the interrogatory glance of the young woman, the wide-eyed eagerness or apprehension of the little girl and the contented indifference of the boy cutting the bread. But an allegorical interpretation seems neither necessary nor probable; the painting speaks to us directly of shared human destiny, borne with dignity.What looks like a pentimento, a painter's change of mind, in the face of the little boy has been revealed by X-radiography to be a crimson ornament in the costume of a bust-length portrait of a bearded man painted underneath. This figure is not a sketch, but a finished, or nearly finished, work. He wears a ruff and a grey doublet with cream braiding. Whether the sitter refused the portrait, or was painted in preparation for a larger picture or an engraving, we do not know, but it seems that not long afterwards, and in the same studio, this prosperous citizen was effaced by four country people at their frugal meal

18369-1604grec.jpg	On 18 June 1603 El Greco signed a contract to make and decorate an altarpiece for a miraculous image of the Virgin of Charity belonging to the Hospital de la Caridad in the small town of Illescas halfway between Toledo and Madrid. According to the contract the main altarpiece and the decoration of the vault were to contain four canvases: The Madonna of Charity, The Coronation of the Virgin, The Annunciation and The Nativity. This project was executed in collaboration with the artist's son, Jorge Manual Theotokopoulos. Under a separate contract a further painting, St Ildefonso was made.All the portraits The Madonna of Charity are of men of Toledo of El Greco's time. The ruffs had grown to rather exaggerated proportions in the twenty years from the time of the Burial of the Count of Orgaz, and their introduction into the painting was censured by the Hospital authorities. At some time they were painted over, but have been recently restored. El Greco's son appears on the extreme right, at about the same age as in the portrait in Seville.Presently the painting is located in a side altar balancing the painting of St Ildefonso

35653-15sketch.jpg	Architect and sculptor Daedalus had built the Cretan labyrinth for King Minos in order to imprison the minotaur. He too was then imprisoned in it by the monarch's order. Wishing to leave the island with his son Icarus, he made two pairs of wings similar to those of birds, using feathers attached with wax. Forgetting his father's advice, Icarus flew too close to the sun, melting the wax of his wings and falling into the sea. Daedalus watches his son's fall despairingly, unable to save him.The Fall of Icarus is another of the sketches that Peter Paul Rubens produced from 1636 onwards for the decoration of the Torre de la Parada. In it he chooses to illustrate the most dramatic moment of Ovid's narrative, when Daedalus looks towards Icarus falling headlong into the void. The painter confers a highly human dimension to his work by representing the painful loss of a son. At the same time he concentrates on the movement of the two bodies, contrasting with the calmness of the sea and the mute intensity of the sun. Icarus is exposed in full light, whilst Daedalus' body is handled in darker tones. This play of light and shadow allows the artist both to place Icarus in the forefront of the picture and to insist on the vulnerability of his flesh. This sketch represents the destiny of man, as does the Fall of Phaethon, also conserved in the museum. Archive documents tell us that these two paintings with a similar theme were placed facing each other in the first room on the ground floor of the Spanish royal hunting pavilion. This strict placing forms an exception, as Rubens' mythological works do not appear to have been arranged according to any pre-established concept. The final picture was painted by Jacob Peter Gowy (Madrid, Prado), and is much more anecdotal than Rubens' sketch. A city is visible to the back of the composition, with two small figures walking on the beach, probably Daedalus and Icarus before starting their flight. Contrary to the Ovid text, which evokes a day of bright sun, the sky is cloudy and the sea choppy

28837-cesaresc.jpg	Moretto worked largely in Brescia, although he assimilated Venetian painting technique early in his career. Given its proximity to Milan, Brescia was culturally and religiously dependent upon the Lombard capital being part of its archdiocese in spite of belonging to Venice's mainland empire.This painting probably depicts Count Fortunato Martinengo Cesaresco (1512-1552), a member of a branch of Brescia's most important noble clan. He was a leading literary figure in the city, founder of the Accademia dei Dubbiosi, and friend of Lodovico Dolce and Pietro Aretino, among others. He married in 1542, and this could well be a painting done at the time of his betrothal. Lavish details combine to evoke an opulent interior and a wonderfully patterned painted surface

17532-1neptun1.jpg	The impact of Gossart's stay in Rome in 1509 took another decade to surface. Between 1516 and 1524 , he again worked for Philip of Burgundy. The Neptune and Amphitrite is the only extant part of a programme of mythological paintings made for Philip's Suytburg (Souburg) castle near Middleburg in Zeeland. The choice of Neptune, god of the sea, and his wife, a Nereid or sea-nymph, was appropriate for the Admiral. These startlingly large nudes (the first nudes in the history of Flemish art) have few precedents in Northern Renaissance art. D�rer's Adam and Eve inspired the poses but not their ample bodies.

44306-solomon.jpg	Solomon was the son of David and Bathsheba, and third king of united Israel; his wisdom was proverbial. Solomon's rein saw the construction of the Temple at Jerusalem.The ostensible purpose of the visit of the Queen of Sheba was to satisfy her curiosity about the travellers' tales she had heard concerning his wisdom and the magnificence of his court. She came with a great camel train bearing gifts of spices, gold and precious stones. In return the king bestowed on her 'all she desired, whatever she asked, in addition to all he gave her of his royal bounty.'In this panel from the Heilspiegel Altarpiece, Witz painted a gold background with filigree ornamentation and placed both his figures before it. The blue, red, green, and white of the clothing and the restrained ochre of the hands and faces may be the only colours, but they radiate light when set against the intense gold of the background, whose effect is increased still further by the elaborate inlay pattern. Witz recognized that an abstract gold background sharpened the contours of a form and made it almost tangible.

39389-1annunc.jpg	"The painting is on the wall of the Sala Inferiore of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco. With its unusual perspective that places the viewer in mid-air, looking down into the house of Mary, this Annunciation is one of the most intimate works of the cycle in the room. Tintoretto multiples the perspective details, such as the straw-bottomed chair below the angel, which emphasizes the poverty of the Virgin.Of the eight phases into which the Venetian Theatine monk Giovanni Marinoni (1490-1562) divided the story of the Annunciation, Tintoretto's painting shows the second, following the angel's greeting: ""And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be"" (Luke 1:29). In late medieval painting north of the Alps, Mary's conception is often shown as a depiction of the infant Christ flying toward the Virgin on a divine ray of light, like a naked putto. As if to follow the path of the heavenly child's flight exactly, Tintoretto multiplies this motif into a whole phallic swarm of putti.The announcement of the imminent divine maternity is given by the Angel to Mary in surroundings where everything is realistically described down to be the smallest detail: the dilapidated brick base and column; the two-coloured floor of large marble tiles; the straw-bottomed chair which clearly shows the passing of time; the work basket and its contents at the Virgin's feet; in the background the large bed covered by a canopy. No less realistic, even if in a theatrically scenographic sense, is the outside setting where Joseph is busy with his work surrounded by carpenter's tools hung outside the hut. Such objective description of the surroundings is contrasted with the visionary intensity of the miraculous apparition of the heavenly messenger and the joyful evangelical song, which break in from the left. They are preceded by the Holy Spirit in the form of a snow-white dove with unfolded wings, almost perpendicularly above the Virgin's head.In some details the hand of Domenico Robusti, Tintoretto's son, has been correctly recognized"

08168-noahsark.jpg	When studying in Genoa under Giovanni Battista Paggi (documented in 1626&#151;27), Castiglione was in contact with the colony of northern artists in the city, above all with the Flemings Lucas and Cornelis de Wael, as well as with Anthony van Dyck. From these painters Castiglione developed a realistic style of great immediacy, concentrating above all on animals and still-lifes set mostly in landscapes with religious staffage. This expertise is clearly seen in the painting depicting Noah's story.Before the Flood, Noah was charged by God to build an ark and to save a male and a female of every species (Genesis VII, 1&#151;9). Castiglione skilfully depicts only part of the event and part of the wooden ship, so that the immensity of its size and the enormity of the number of animals is left to the viewer's imagination. Noah arranges the entry of the animals, which have assembled in two lines parallel to the picture plane. Curiously they consist only of European indigenous animals, many of them domestic

19685-westerk.jpg	A prolific Dutch specialist of the newly developed theme of townscape, van der Heyden was in his day better known as an inventor: he organised municipal street lighting in Amsterdam and patented the first fire engine equipped with pumpdriven hoses. With seemingly endless patience and a talent for technical drawing, he painted architectural vistas, real and imaginary, in the greatest and most minute detail. In this picture, for example, one can read some of the tattered posters on the wooden hoardings protecting the young trees in the foreground; one of them advertises a sale of paintings. At the same time, however, he was able to subordinate detail to the whole, and what makes this painting so especially magical is the luminous sky, the light of which reflects from the rosy brick and yellow cobblestone as much as from the sluggish water and, glinting through the leaves, permeates the entire scene.The picture is exceptional in van der Heyden's work by virtue of its large size, about three times the scale of similar compositions by him. It was commissioned by the governing body of the Westerkerk to hang in their meeting room in the church, and the patrons must have specified the dimensions.Unlike older Netherlandish churches, the Westerkerk was purposely built to accommodate Protestant worship. It was designed by Thomas de Keyser, father of the painter, and completed only in 1638. By choosing a viewpoint from across the canal, van der Heyden simultaneously locates it companionably along the city street and isolates it, screening neighbouring buildings and closing off the edges of the painting with foliage (the mature tree on our side of the canal on the left was an afterthought). Lively incidents are added for human interest, although the scale of the figures is less secure than the architectural composition, and they, like the reflectionless swans, may have been painted in by another artist. Such collaboration between a view painter and a figure specialist was quite frequent at the time. An additional point of interest for the modern viewer is that Rembrandt was buried in the Westerkerk in 1669

07559-42loreto.jpg	In 1603 money was given by the heirs of one Ermete Cavalletti for the decoration of the family chapel in the church of San Agostino, not far from the Piazza Navona, at the centre of Caravaggio's Rome. By the end of 1604 this painting was installed in a spot where it has been ever since. In the winter of 1603-04 Caravaggio had been in Tolentino, not far from the shrine of Loreto, and he may have gone there to see the supposed Holy House of Nazareth.He has made simple devotion affecting. Two pilgrims - pellegrini in Italian - kneel in prayer before the statue beside a pillar, while the Madonna and Child, living to the eyes of faith, look down on them in quiet attention. (The painting is also called Madonna dei Pellegrini.) The woman has a ruckled bonnet and the dirty soles of the man's feet are so close to the spectator that they cannot be avoided. The haloes on the sacred figures and their raised position remove them from our world, but their beauty contains no hint of arrogance - they gaze at the world with gentle sympathy.Some have seen in this Madonna the latest woman in Caravaggio's life Lena or Maddalena, over whom he had a fight. She is painted with love, but has only one rich passage in the left arm of her dress; elsewhere colour is toned down. Her craning neck was to be almost a mannerism in Caravaggio's works of this period, but here the pose is convincing

19894-9morette.jpg	Born about 1480, the French ambassador Charles de Solier remained in London from April 3 to July 26, 1534, during which time Holbein must have painted this portrait. As the name of the man is not written on the painting, it was forgotten over the centuries, and until the 19th century even the painter was not known. Consequently, when Augustus III of Saxony (elector 1733-1763) acquired the panel in 1746, it was described as a portrait of the ruler of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, Il Moro (duke 1481-1499), painted by Leonardo da Vinci

32901-3libera.jpg	"The story in the New Testament says that King Herod took Peter prisoner and intended to have him killed. In prison the Apostle was chained to two guards, but an angel of the Lord freed him despite the close watch. The fresco is dated 1514 on two painted tablets in the picture.The composition of this fresco clearly reflects the order and unity of the Mass of Bolsena. But the story is broken down into three distinct episodes, taken from the Acts of the Apostles. The first shows the dismay of the guards; the second the appearance of the Angel of Freedom in the saint's cell; the third, the bewildered Peter led by the hand of the divine messenger. The barred cell is on an upper level (like the altar in the Mass) and is reached by steps to the left and right. A group of agitated figures occupies the stairway at the left. Here, a soldier - whose armor reflects the light of the moon asks his sleepy and bewildered comrades what is going on. At right, the angel leads the stunned and still-sleepy St Peter past another sleeping guard. Here, for the first time, Raphael attempts a ""night effect"", using both the natural light of the moon and the autonomous light of the angel.Raphael's assistants played a greater role in painting the Eliodoro cycle than in the Stanza della Segnatura. This is clearly a consequence of the growing number of commissions which the Romans granted to Raphael. The hand of Giulio Romano, one of his most faithful pupils, is visible in the episode showing the Liberation of St Peter.This painting is the last fresco that can be attributed to Raphael with any certainty. The large cycles which follow (except for the Sibyls of Santa Maria della Pace) were entrusted mainly to assistants."

17813-717goya.jpg	After the restoration of Ferdinand VII in 1814, Goya was commissioned to paint several portraits of him for ministries and public buildings. For these he seems to have used the same study of the King's head, possibly the drawing in the Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid. The pose, the setting and the costume are varied to suit the occasion. The effect &#151; perhaps intentional - is that of a living head on the body of a dummy. In this ceremonial portrait, the King appears in the uniform of a Captain General with a military camp in the background - a conventional formula, since he had taken part in no military campaign, having spent the war years in France. The broad painting of the costume and decorations and the sketchy treatment of the background direct attention to the head of the King which stands out as a grimly realistic character study

10567-pardigon.jpg	This landscape painting has a very much more representational and colourful quality than the Iles d'Or. For Cross it is an important picture because he created a companion-piece for it, showing approximately the same section but extended by one figure and with its theme  as the evening sun instead of the midday light. There is a distinct three-dimensional gradation leading from the pine on the hill to the group of trees situated further back and over the sea to the chain of hills. The dissolving of a southern landscape into intensive dabs of colour reveals here the close relationship between Neo-Impressionism and Fauvism, in whose emergence this painting played an important part

40219-madre2.jpg	"Towards the end of the 15th century, a new kind of Mother-of-God icon appeared in Cretan icon-painting. It quickly became very widespread and remained extremely popular with artists and patrons until well into the 17th century. This type is known as the ""Madre della Consolazione"" (Mother of Consolation) and is distinguished by a striking Italian influence. As in many Italian paintings of the Madonna, we find the fine, diaphanous veil beneath the maphorion (overdress) of the Mother of God instead of the Eastern cap or bonnet. Western too is the way the garment of the Virgin is fastened over the breast with a clasp, and the incuse patterning of the haloes. Typically Venetian is the opulent golden pattern of the Virgin's garment, which can be seen in similar form on many Venetian Trecento paintings, especially those by Paolo Veneziano and his successors. The Christ-child is holding an open scroll with the (in places heavily abbreviated) Greek inscription: ""The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me"""

00773-1annunc1.jpg	In a loggia of columns and arches, the angel appears to Mary. Shown in profile, he occupies the larger part of the painting, his richly painted wings extending out through the colonnade, their upper tips marking the centre of the picture. He declaims to the Virgin, 'the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee' (Luke 1, v. 35). She, demure, with a dove fluttering above her head in a burst of golden light, inclines towards him and responds, 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word' (Luke 1, v. 38). Beyond them the picture space extends into the Virgin's chamber, and further, hidden space is hinted at by the bed curtain there which serves also to set off Gabriel's nimbus.Outside the loggia is a delicately painted garden, enclosed by a palisade, symbolic of Mary's virginity. Carved in a roundel above the centre column is a half-length effigy of Isaiah, who had prophesied the birth of a child to a virgin. The pink entablature of the loggia points to the second reference to the Old Testament, in the top left corner, where Adam and Eve are expelled from Paradise.Undoubtedly Angelico's first truly great painting, this Annunciation formed a prototype for a noble line of derivatives

It was signed by Gozzoli on 23 October 1461 and adumbrates not just the various parts of the altarpiece, but also the artist's obligations as regards the frame, the gilding, and the quality of the pigments to be used.The altarpiece was dismembered on the suppression of the confraternity in 1802 and its various elements dispersed. (The predella may have already been detached by this time.) The panel with the Madonna and Child among Saints is now in the National Gallery, London; the scenes from the predella are in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin (St Zanobius Raising a Child from the Dead), the National Gallery of Art in Washington (The Dance of Salome), The Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan (St Dominic Raising a Child from the Dead), the Museum of Art, Philadelphia (Purification of the Virgin) and Hampton Court (Fall of Simon Magus), while the right-hand pillar with three saints is in the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence.The Fall of Simon Magus is a subject taken from The Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine and it involves a contest between a sorcerer at the court of Emperor Nero and Saint Peter. Nero is seen enthroned on the left while Saint peter and Saint Paul are on the right. Simon Magus, endeavouring to prove his magical powers, attempts to launch himself from a wooden tower towards heaven, but even though supported by demons his experiment fails and he falls to the ground

19888-6chesema.jpg	Robert Cheseman (1485-1547) was an influential figure in Middlesex, where he was responsible for marshalling levies. He more than once raised troops for Henry VIII's campaigns. Along with other minor figures at court, many of whom were to rise with the fortunes of Thomas Cromwell in the 1530s, Cheseman was the sort of patron on whom Holbein concentrated during the first few years of his second English sojourn. Such clients were less in evidence once Henry and his royal entourage had adopted 'the Apelles of our time'.These English sitters had more limited intellectual aims in mind for their portraits than the foreign merchants or ambassadors in London. The need for clear, effective portrayal, shorn of symbolism (and expensively painted detail) perhaps accounts for the innovatory use of the information about the sitter, that floats in gold lettering on the blue background, a feature more familiar in miniatures. The artist's regressive abandonment of spatially interesting, illusionistic backgrounds may be another indicator of the undeveloped taste of English clients - a full native understanding of perspective construction did not arise until Inigo Jones' theatre-design work around 1615. Cheseman was the chief falconer to the English king Henry VIII, an honourable position. He had himself painted holding a falcon that he is stroking on his hand with a tender gesture. The head of the bird is capped, because the falcon is not supposed to see anything until the falconer sets him at a target. Cheseman  appears to be looking for just such a target, his gaze apparently scanning the distance, beyond the pictorial field.The very fine portrayal of the falcon shows Holbein's great power in observing nature; the bird's presence, signifying Cheseman's wish to show his social status, neatly serves to illustrate human nature

38563-gallery.jpg	"In 1646 Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria was appointed Governor of the Low Countries and took up residence at the Coudenberg Palace in Brussels. He already owned an attractive collection of paintings, which he constantly expanded by buying Flemish paintings and, principally, works by the top Italian masters. In 1651 Teniers was appointed court painter and curator of the Archduke's gallery. In this capacity it is very likely that he was charged with acquiring in England the Italian paintings of the illustrious Hamilton collection and those of King Charles I, as it is certain that he undertook a trip across the channel in the same year. The Archduke, very proud of his sumptuous Italian collection, charged Teniers with reproducing the 244 most prestigious works in reduced format. These copies were to serve as models for the engravings illustrating the Theatrum pictorium Davidis Teniers..., a monumental collection published at Antwerp in 1660. Also asked to paint a grand view of the collection, the artist undertook this first task with great talent and considerable mastery.This painting, dating from 1651, is the very first of a numerous series of views of the Archduke's collection that Teniers was to paint. This harmonious, symmetrical, linear and very precise composition shows us part of the Governor's very recent Italian collection. Dressed in the fashion of the Spanish Grandees, he is standing under the central arcade and studying a drawing presented to him by the painter. Other sketches and ""objets d'art"" are spread out on a stone table supported by a bronze base representing Ganymedes and the eagle, a work that Emperor Rudolf II commissioned from the famous sculptor Adriaen de Vries in Prague. The elegantly-dressed figure to the left, holding a statuette, is probably a courtier.Space is too short here to give a complete listing of the works decorating the Archduke's gallery. It is not difficult to identify these masterpieces, which the Archduke took with him to Vienna when he left Brussels in 1656, as Teniers was careful to indicate the artist on each picture frame. Most of these paintings are still in Vienna, where, with Leopold Wilhelm's other collections, they form the main core of the Pinakothek of the Kunsthistorisches Museum."

David's confidence in surpassing his rival, coupled with his aggressive and ambitious nature, make it very possible that he chose to paint his own Socrates when he learned of Peyron's plans. The force and clarity of David's version was thrown into even sharper relief by the lack of drama and focus in Peyron's work, and both the public and critics declared David's work to be far superior. David eclipsed his long-time rival once and for all, and from then on Peyron had to be content with a subordinate role in the art world

35750-1morning.jpg	To the seventeenth-century German mystic Jacob Boehme, Runge owed the concept that flowers can symbolize different human states. With their cycle from first bud to death, their response to light, and as manifestations of God's purpose on earth, flowers were for Runge the most revealing of all natural forms. Together with small children and musical instruments they formed the allegorical base of his most ambitious work, a series on the theme of Times of Day. This was intended to take the form of four huge oil paintings, and to be experienced in a Gothic chapel to the music of choirs and poetry by his friend the writer Ludwig Tieck. This grand plan never materialized; the designs were published in some rather unsatisfactory engravings in 1806 and 1807, while only one of the four subjects, Morning, was developed in oil, in two versions (the larger was later cut into fragments, having failed to satisfy the painter himself).The painting represents a supreme statement of the nature mysticism associated with the Romantic movement, and is undoubtedly the masterpiece of Runge's short life. He began work on it in Dresden, where he had been greatly moved by Raphael's Sistine Madonna in the picture gallery, and his tightly structured, vertical compositions have some of the qualities of altarpieces. As in the earlier Nightingale's Lesson, they are surrounded by hieroglyphic borders, combining Christian and mythological symbolism. Individual plants, minutely scrutinized like botanical specimens, are integrated into visionary patterns. In Morning, Runge was able to incorporate his researches into colour theory, based on association and the revelatory power of light. The small version contains a passage of sublimely lovely pure landscape painting &#151; the summer meadow on whose carpet of flowers a baby wakes at dawn.

07952-stephen.jpg	This small panel showing the martyrdom of St Stephen reveals a very different side of Annibale's art, and one that fully confirms his consummate skill in applying the stylistic means appropriate to the theme.Before the walls of the city, a group of men has gathered to execute Stephen, a deacon of Christian faith. The martyr is already on his knees and bleeding. He pays no heed to the stones being brandished menacingly against him, for already an angel is floating towards him bearing the crown and palm frond of the martyr. It is a celestial messenger from the golden realms of heaven which can be seen beyond the parted clouds, revealing a glimpse of God and Christ, who - visible only to the saint - have appeared to witness his martyrdom. A number of individual movements over a broad area have been skilfully drawn together against a sweeping landscape background.The great finesse of this painting with its meticulous draughtsmanship and its strong yet delicate colority reveals a mastery of compositional organization capable of lending superb form to a dramatic event

24461-pisa_cen.jpg	"Vasari wrote: ""Masaccio can be given the credit for originating a new style of painting ... he produced work that is living, realistic, and natural.""Masaccio's innovations were not technical, for his work on panel uses traditional materials and methods, as do his paintings in fresco. Inspired by the ideals of Giotto, by contemporary interest in ancient Roman remains, by the recent experiments of his friends the architect-sculptor Brunelleschi and the sculptor Donatello, he relied above all on observation of nature. His study of perspective was allied to an equally profound analysis of light. The lutes of the two angels at the Virgin's feet are demonstrations, obviously studied from the model, of the joint effect of foreshortening and directional illumination. The peg box of the instrument on the right faces inwards, the other is turned towards us. The strong light shining from the upper left helps define rounded and flat surfaces and right angles, and the shadows and penumbras cast by the angels' hands look so natural that we almost take them for granted.The painting is the central panel of a large, 19 pieces winged altar executed for a chapel of the Carmelite Church in Pisa. Ten other panels of the altarpiece are in various museums. The painting has been cut down at the base, and has lost its original frame, although the arch at the top, firmly locating the throne behind it, is Masaccio's. The silver-leaf backing of the Virgin's red robe has tarnished, the red itself has darkened, and the paint surface is abraded and disfigured, revealing the green undermodelling of the Virgin's face; the original effect would have been much more decorative. Yet decoration could never have been Masaccio's main interest. The Virgin, as voluminous as a Roman statue, sits on a massive throne incorporating the three orders of columns of Roman architecture. The wavy pattern at the base is copied from Roman sarcophagi. The Child himself, naked and plump like a sculpted Roman putto, wears an elliptical halo on his head; its foreshortening defines his position on his mother's lap.Masaccio's egg tempera medium is deficient, when compared to contemporary Netherlandish oil paintings, in its ability to differentiate texture and lustre. But his grave vision of the structure of things seems all the weightier for lacking surface blandishments"

10045-agatlucy.jpg	This panel of Sienese in origin has been attributed both to Cozzarelli and Matteo di Giovanni, who was probably the teacher of Cozzarelli around 1470.

14909-early11.jpg	The significance of this still-life seems to have been highly personal and it was probably painted either while Gauguin was still in Copenhagen with his wife's family or just after he arrived back in Paris with Clovis. The canvas in the background can be identified as one from his collection by the artist Armand Guillaumin, with whom Gauguin had painted in the summer of 1881. The mandoline was one of the possessions that he took on all his travels and the vase is very similar to those that Gauguin started to make the following year.At the same time, the work is an exercise in formal arrangement, with the arabesques of the objects on the table being offset by the horizontals and verticals in the background.

39411-campo.jpg	The Scuola Grande di San Rocco is the best preserved, as regards the architecture and fittings, of Venice's six Scuole Grandi (Major Guilds) which for many centuries, together with the minor Confraternities, formed the thick network of brotherhoods of a religious nature. These were set up to help the poor and the sick, or to protect the interests of individual professions, or to help the weak and needy members of non-Venetian communities living in the city.The guild dedicated to San Rocco of Montpellier who died in Piacenza in 1327 and whose remains are thought to have been brought to Venice in 1485, was legally recognized in 1478. Its aim was to relieve the suffering of the sick, especially those stricken by the epidemics.The present building of the Scuola was begun in 1517 by Bartolomeo Bon who designed it and supervised the work until 1524.

44000-00beaun2.jpg	As long as the polyptych hung in its original place, it was traditional to open the wings on Sundays and solemn feast days. But since it has been restored, it is now kept in a neighbouring room which is air-conditioned to prevent any further deterioration due to the heat generated by the three hundred thousand visitors who come to see it each year. The panels were sawn in half across the thickness of the wood a few years ago, and both front and the reverse are now exhibited simultaneously, side by side.The reverse of the panels of the polyptych depict the donors. Nicolas Rolin is an old man, whose nose is too long and whose hair has been cut short. Guigonne de Salins lowers her eyes and gestures with her joined hands towards her book of hours; on her head she wears a starched net veil. Behind each of them, an angel is carrying a shield emblazoned with their respective coats-of-arms.

24469-trinity.jpg	"This is the most famous work of Masaccio beside the frescoes in the Cappelle Brancacci. There are various opinions as to exactly when this fresco was painted between 1425 and 1428. It was described in detail by Vasari in 1568, who emphasized the virtuosity of the ""trompe l'oeil"" in the architectural structure of the painting: ""a barrel vault drawn in perspective, and divided into squares with rosettes which diminish and are foreshortened so well that there seems to be a hole in the wall.""Only two years after Vasari's book was published, the erection of a stone altar caused the fresco to be covered up by a panel of the Madonna of the Rosary painted by Vasari himself. Thus the fresco remained unknown for further generations from 1570 to 1861 when owing to the removal of the 16th century altar it was again uncovered. After being removed and placed on the internal facade of the church between the left and the central doors, it was put back in its original position in 1952, as a result of the discovery, beneath the 19th century neo-Gothic altar, of the lower section of the fresco with Adam's skeleton and the painted altar table, once part of the whole work.The reconstructed work was taken up by critics as the symbol and revelation of Brunelleschi's principles in architecture and the use of perspective, to the point that some believed Brunelleschi to have had a direct hand in the work.The most likely interpretation of the Trinity is that the painting alludes to the traditional medieval double chapel of Golgotha, with Adam's tomb in the lower part (the skeleton) and the Crucifixion in the upper part. But it can also assume the significance of the journey the human spirit must undertake to reach salvation, rising from the earthly life (the corruptible body) through prayer (the two petitioners) and the intercession of the Virgin and saints (John the Evangelist) to the Trinity.A close-up view of the skeleton in the sarcophagus also revealed the ancient warning, in clear letters: I WAS WHAT YOU ARE AND WHAT I AM YOU SHALL BE"

35500-30mythol.jpg	This is a joint work by Rubens an Jan Brueghel the Elder for which Brueghel painted the landscape and Rubens the figures.The painting represents a scene from Ovid's Metamorphoses. The lustful shepherd-god Pan pursued the shy, virginal nymph Syrinx, who ran to a river to escape him, calling on her 'sisters of the stream' to turn her into a reed. Just as Pan attempted to seize the nymph, she was transformed and he was left holding not a beautiful maiden but a bunch of reeds. From these he made his pipes, ever since called the syrinx, whose lovely tones reminded him of his lost love.Rubens, for whom Pan and the nymphs symbolise positive forces of nature, has based his Syrinx - modestly covering her loins with one hand and seemingly fending off the fast-closing Pan with the other - on the ancient Medici Venus, famous since the 16th century. Jan Brueghel the Elder, renowned for his life-like depiction of plants and animals, nestles the scene in a lively and luxuriant landscape

17991-00chapel.jpg	As early as 1442 Pope Martin V had given the Medicis permission to build a private chapel with a portable family altar. The chapel, in the first floor of the Medicis' private residence, was built by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo (1396-1472) between 1446 and 1449 and dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It comprises an almost square main room and, one step higher, an equally nearly square chancel. The two are separated from each other by two Corinthian pillars.Cosimo de' Medici chose Benozzo Gozzoli to decorate the chapel. The pictorial program of the chapel is also structured in two parts: the Procession of the Magi in the main room and the Adoration of the Child in the chancel with the Angels worshipping on the side walls. The ceiling is decorated by a diamond-pointed ring in a halo with a loop that bears the motto of Piero de' Medici, semper, and within it inside a glory the monogram of Christ, JHS, as used for St Bernardino of Siena.The Procession of the Magi extends across the east, south and west walls of the main room above the encircling benches. These three walls were painted in about 150 working days, and each represents one of the Three Kings. The east wall leads off with the youngest king, the story continues on the south wall with the middle king, and ends on the west wall with the oldest king. An unusual feature of this depiction is that the procession does not arrive at the manger. The adoration of the Christ Child was reserved for the contemporary observers present in the room, and their prayers were said within the important framework of the procession of the magi taking place on either side.The Procession of the Magi moves towards Filippo Lippi's altar painting of the Adoration of the Child. (The original, which was replaced with a copy in 1494, is now in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin.) Until the expulsion of the Medicis in 1494, the chapel was used to house the so-called Reliquiario del Libretto. It contains relics of the Passion and is now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence. Worth mentioning are the double walls, the chapel's secret escape routes which could also be used as a hiding place and place of refuge. The double walls explain the good state of preservation of the frescoes, which were thus protected from damp. Originally it was relatively dark in the chapel, for the two small oculi only admitted a little light. In the torch and candlelight that illuminated the room, the shining gold and metal layers on the paintings must have had a powerful effect.In 1659, the Riccardi family bought the Palazzo Medici and undertook some structural changes. This included, in 1689, the building of an exterior flight of stairs leading up to the first floor. For this purpose the entrance to the chapel had to be moved. During the process, two sections of wall were cut out of the south western corner, in the procession of the oldest king. After the stairs were finished, the cut out elements were mounted on a corner of the wall projecting into the room. During the course of this, the oldest king's horse was cut up and mounted on two different segments of the wall. The empty section of wall above the new door now contains a landscape in the style of Benozzo. In addition, two windows were built on either side of the door, of which only the one on the left still exists. A large window that was integrated into the apse wall in the 19th century was bricked up again in 1929

24506-healing.jpg	Both the events depicted in this fresco are recounted in the Acts of the Apostles: the healing of the cripple in Jerusalem (3: 1-10) and the raising of Tabitha in Joppa (9: 36 43). Masolino sets both events in the same town although they had actually taken place in different cities and at different times.This detail shows the left side of the fresco with the scene Healing the Cripple.In the square there are two elegantly dressed characters, in the centre of the scene, who separate but also provide the link between the two miraculous events. The presence of these two figures, and also the characters depicted in the background in front of the houses, makes the two events look like normal everyday occunences in the life of a city. The square resembles a contemporary Florentine piazza and the houses in the background, although none of them is strictly speaking an accurate portrayal of an existing building, convey the idea of Florentine architecture, as we still know it today. Even the paving of the street, different from that of the square, is a note of pure realism: the cobblestones, decreasing in size as they recede., also serve to emphasize the perspective of the composition.And there are other elements which contribute to this description of everyday city life: the flower pots on the window sills, the laundry hanging out to dry,the bird cages, the two monkeys, the people leaning out of the windows to chat with their neighbours, and so on.In the past the loggia to the left had been considered by critics to be architecturally fragile and unconvincing. But now, thanks to the restoration, we can make out the structural elements: from the smooth capitals of the pilasters, to the red plaster inside the courts.And even in the righthand loggia, where the miracle. of the raising of Tabitha takes place, the classical, Albertian colour pattern of the surfaces and the entablatures increases the solidity of the architecture.Throughout the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th, scholars attributed this fresco to Masaccio, until 1929 when it was re-attributed to Masolino. Some critics claimed that there were sections painted by Masaccio. In 1940 it was suggested that Masaccio was responsible for the entire architectural background of the scene, including the figures in the background. This theory was accepted by almost all later scholars.Since the restoration, now that the pictorial techniques can be clearly distinguished, we can rule out any intervention by Masaccio at all, at any rate in the actual execution

42295-0713vela.jpg	Exceptional powers of observation and an unprecedentedly vibrant technique make Vel�zquez the greatest Spanish painter of his century. As court painter to King Philip IV of Spain, Vel�zquez was sent in 1649 to Rome, then the centre of the international art world. He wished to pay another visit to a country that was so rich in art, and he had also been commissioned to buy pictures and casts of classical statues in Rome for Philip IV's collections. He met the most famous Italian artists of the time in the capital, and tried unsuccessfully to entice some of them to Madrid. He also showed his own skill in many portraits painted while he was in Rome. He made here two of his greatest portraits, one of Pope Innocent X (Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome) and another, of his studio assistant Juan de Pareja, a Sevillian of Moorish descent.In the portrait of Juan de Pareja, a wide white collar with a jagged border contrasts effectively with the black of the model's hair and beard and his copper-coloured complexion. The dark eyes glow with great expressive force.According to an eye-witness, this half-length portrait of Pareja was displayed in the Pantheon in Rome during the celebrations of the Feast of St Joseph on 19 March 1650, and met with unreserved admiration from artists of many different nationalities. one connoisseur remarked that while all the rest was art, this alone was truth. It won admission to the Roman Academy for the Spanish court painter, serving Vel�zquez as a kind of entree, and he could expect its success to bring him commissions to paint some very distinguished people. Sure enough, the Pope himself was soon sitting for him, and so were members of the papal household

19729-hardwick.jpg	This portrait, called the Hardwick Portrait, was executed by the workshop of Hilliard. It concurs with others of the 'Armada' type, painted after 1588, in which the Queen is characterised by a rigid and hieratic expression and depicted almost as an impersonal image. It is thought that it was Bess of Hardwick (by then Countess of Shrewsbury), who masterminded the design of the embroidery on the Queen's dress, and possibly worked on it herself, intending it to be a spectacular New Year's Day gift to the Queen. It is typical of the extravagant and sometimes bizarre late-Elizabethan style of embroidery which mixed together all manner of motifs taken from the natural world.This portrait of the Queen was brought from London to Hardwick in 1599

Raphael had sketched this fresco, but its execution was entrusted to Lorenzo Lotto. Civil law is juxtaposed with religious law to the right of the window: Gregory IX approves the collection of decretals made by Raymond Penaforte. The historical pope is actually a portrait of the pope who commissioned the work, Julius II, alongside other members of the College of Cardinals: Giiovanni de' Medici and Alessandro Farnese are the throne assistants, and Cardinal del Monte is at far left.

32637-barge.jpg	Adam Pynacker is said to have spent three years in Italy. Although no documentary evidence support the statement, the subtly observed reflections of the light clouds in the luminous morning sky upon the mirror-smooth water of his outstanding Barges on a River suggest that he had firsthand contact with the landscape in Italy.The picture is unusual in his oeuvre. More characteristic are paintings of prominent white birches and beeches, elegant reeds, and clumps of thistles streaked with silvery light, seen against distant views of blue mountains. After working in Schiedam, a port near Rotterdam that was probably his birthplace, and possibly in nearby Delft, he settled in 1661 in Amsterdam where he began to produce large-scale landscapes for patrician homes. Toward the end of the decade the demand for his landscapes of this type apparently dwindled. The works of his last years, often variations on earlier compositions, are cabinet-size with colours that are rather harsh and metallic

From the infant amusing himself wit a young goldfinch, our gaze shifts to the Virgin's sad face, then to the resigned faces of Joseph and John the baptist, before finally plunging into the agitated gloom of the firmament, in front of the ominous cross looms.Formerly the painting was attributed to Rosso Fiorentino

26386-1self_po.jpg	Meytens's earliest self-portrait, a young painter's portrait with a turban, in the painters' gallery of Florences's Uffizi, was made during his Italian residence in 1727. This was followed in 1735 by a half-figure self-portrait, which can be found in two versions, in Sibiu's Muzeul Brukenthal, and in Ludwigsburg Gallery. The Budapest self-portrait belongs to a later period, and shows a slightly changed, somewhat more corpulent man. His face is still youthfully smooth, but already fattish, and he wears an Allonge-wig. His pose refers to his courtly position and special honours. A gold chain on his breast holds the medal he got in 1730 from Frederic, King of Sweden during his activity in Stockholm, and he ostentatiously shows with his right hand the medallion portrait of Empress Maria Theresia.Another half-figure portrait, now kept in the Viennese Gem&#228;ldegalerie der Akademie der bildenden K�nste, as well as a painting in a Stockholm private collection, show the master some years older and of even more authority. Compared to these portraits and to the one engraved by Johann Gottfried Haid in 1756, our painting can probably be ascribed to the beginning of the 1740s

Compared to Augustine's start at the School of Tagaste, Benozzo gave the scene an appropriate distance from the observer. The arrangement and scale of the figures underline the perspective indicated by the floor tiles. The parallel lines converge on the figure of the saint. The two listeners sitting to the right of him are repeated on the left as almost mirror images, thereby supporting the balance of the spatial composition. The pictorial space opens out towards the teacher. The dog sitting on the floor in the foreground is given a predominantly negative status in the Bible.

39806-06charle.jpg	The painting commemorates the emperor's victory over the Protestant princes at the Battle of M�hlberg on 24 April 1547. The dominant red in the foreground, visible on Charles' helmet decorations, his sash and the horses trim, was the colour of the Catholic faction in the many religious wars of the 16th and 17th centuries.This is one of Titian's most dramatic and monumental portraits, conveying not so much the personality of the sitter as the high ideals of his imperial office. At the Battle of M�hlberg the Emperor had defeated the Schmalkadic League of Protestant princes, and in Titian's picture he is portrayed as the archetypal Christian knight victorious against heresy - a kind of modern St George. Apart from the brilliant creation of a memorable image, Titian shows his skill in the consummate handling of textures, such as the diffusion of the evening sunlight through the landscape and the captivating sheen of the armour

39616-1resurr.jpg	The Polyptych of Resurrection in SS Nazzaro e Celso in Brescia was commissioned by Altobello Averoldi, papal legate to Venice, in 1518/19. The format of five panels is old-fashioned, but the dynamic relation between Christ and St Sebastian, predicting the triumph of both, anticipates the Baroque. Titian openly vies with sculpture in the two main figures, taking inspiration from the recently discovered Hellenistic statue of Laocoon and - in the case of Sebastian - one of the slaves from Michelangelo's tomb for Julius II.Titian's impulse to capture bold bodily movements is not easily accommodated within the traditional structure of a polyptych, which necessitated depicting different pictorial elements on a number of panels. It is certain that this antiquated form was used the request of the client, the papal legate Altobello Averoldi. He is depicted (bottom left panel) with the patron saints of the church, St Nazaro and St Celso, to whom he donated the altar.New Mannerist tendencies are also apparent here, possibly transmitted to Titian through the work of Pordenone, and these elements subtly contribute to the dramatic intensity of the work. The landscape background is of the very highest quality, with recognizable view of Brescia.

28612-3etreta1.jpg	�tretat, a Norman fishing village popular among artists of Courbet's generation and, later, the Impressionists. Its great cliffs, rising so precipitously from the beach and from the waters provided a striking contrast to sand-bound or storm-tossed boats below, and with the ever-changing sea and sky.One of the main features is a rock formation known as Porte d'Aval (or Aiouille), where a natural flying buttress appears to support an equally natural, crenellated tower. This sense of implicit architecture suggests a great city lost in primeval times. There are two other formations called Porte d'Amont, and the Manneporte.

35433-58religi.jpg	The Golden Legend, drawing on the apocryphal gospels, tells how the Virgin Mary was brought up as a child in the Temple at Jerusalem 'with other virgins'...and was visited daily of angels', since it had been foretold to her parents, Joachim and Anne, that their daughter was to be consecrated to the Lord as the 'chosen vessel' of Christ's Incarnation. The theme became popular in the 16th century and remained so after the Counter-Reformation in spite of some disapproval by the Church because of its apocryphal character. Mary is seen in earlier examples teaching her young companions, sewing the priest vestments or being ministered to by angels who bring bread and water. But the favourite theme, especially in Counter-Reformation art, depicts her education in the strict sense, at the knee of her mother Anne, learning to read.You can view other depictions of the Education of the Virgin in the Web Gallery of Art

03339-savonaro.jpg	"Girolamo Savonarola (1452-1498), born in Ferrara, was for some time prior of the Convent of San Marco. Inspired by an aversion for worldly things, and the highest religious ideals, with his example and his obscurely threatening and prophetic sermons he condemned first the corrupt way of life of Florence then the church hierarchy in Rome. Ignoring numerous reprimands and contemptuous of danger, he was condemned to death: together with his fellow friars, Domenico da Pescia and Silvestro Maruffi, he was hanged and burnt in Piazza Signoria on 23 May 1498.Fra Bartolomeo, who entered the Dominican order, probably painted this portrait of Savonarola while the latter was still alive. We see the sharp profile of the ascetic painted against a black background under a dark hood. The Latin inscription on the panel below the portrait proves that the monk was considered to be a prophet: ""Portrait of the prophet Jerome of Ferrara, sent by God."

34968-2mustai1.jpg	The best preserved Carolingian fresco cycle can be found in a remote valley in Graub�nden, in the monastery church of M�stair. The church is dedicated to St John the Baptist, and it is generally believed to have been founded by in about 790, and probably by Charlemagne. One can assume that the frescoes were painted soon after the completion of the monastery church. Located in the apses, the paintings remained undiscovered until 1896 and were finally completely uncovered by 1950. Parts of the frescoes had been painted over in the twelfth century by artists belonging to the School of Salzburg.The artists who executed the paintings did not belong to Charlemagne's court school. Extensive commissions were taken on by itinerant artists who came from Italy and were trained in Byzantine style. The Byzantine influence can be found not only in the shapes but also in the treatment of the pictorial narrative, that is the manner in which the individual scenes are emphasized by the articulation of the architectural elements around them

18240-0601grec.jpg	The problem of identification surrounds this portrait, usually identified as the famous sculptor Pompeo Leoni, the major sculptor at the court of Philip II, the son of Leone Leoni, who had been employed in a similar capacity by Philip's father, Charles V. A serious objection to this identification is the fact that the marble bust of Philip II included in the painting is significantly different from those attributable to Leoni.The sitter is depicted as a practitioner of a liberal art. He is elegantly and modestly dressed in black. His dark, penetrating eyes and high brow imply his intellectual capacity. The hammer is poised to suggest his mental deliberation. El Greco has ingeniously applied the conventional formula of the self-portrait, in which the artist turns to face the viewer while working at the easel. Wittily, the viewer can imagine the sculptor looking at the sitter (Philip II) posing for his bust portrait.The portrait was surely known by Vel�zquez, whose 1635 portrait of the great Seville sculptor Juan Mart�nez Monta&#241;�s seems to reflect it

16834-monteluc.jpg	In 1505 the nuns of the convent of Monteluce near Perugia commissioned Raphael for a painting of the Coronation of the Virgin. On the death of Raphael (1520) only some drawings were ready. In 1523 Raphael's assistants Giulio Romano and Giovan Francesco Penni were contracted to execute the altarpiece which was finally completed in 1525. The altar represents a compound, iconographically unusual subject, the Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin. The work is made up of two parts, painted on different occasions and then joined together. The most likely hypothesis is that the upper panel with the Coronation of the Virgin (after a sketch by Raphael) is the work of Giulio Romano, while for the lower part with the Apostles gathered around a tomb covered in flowers an altarpiece by Giovan Francesco Penni was used

32782-22grandu.jpg	The Madonna del Granduca (1504) in the Pitti Gallery in Florence shows the pre-eminent influence of Leonardo. Its simple composition is a prototype for the future Madonnas of Raphael's last Florentine period. The figures of the Virgin and Child emerge from a dark background (an element evidently derived from Leonardo), bound together by a sweet sentiment which derives largely from the gesture of the Child who, while looking toward the spectator, presses against his Mother The painting belonged to the 17th century Florentine painter, Carlo Dolci, and then to Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Lorraine from whom its name derives.In spite of the fact that this painting is in part changed by the drastic nineteenth century restoration which included the repainting of the background and of the dress, it has still remained one of the finest creations of Raphael in his early period, at the time, when having come to Florence after his first formation under Perugino, he became acquainted with Florentine art at the beginning of the Cinquecento; and as is clearly seen in this work, was especially impressed by the painting of Leonardo. In the Madonna del Granduca both the Peruginesque and the Leonardesque influences are fused and assimilated by the young artist into a marvellous harmony which extends to the whole composition, from the spacing of the two figures in the space with that sense of flowing rhythm to the magic of the colour which softly dissolves into delicate shadow.Raphael's greatest paintings seem so effortless that one does not usually connect them with the idea of hard and relentless work. To many he is simply the painter of sweet Madonnas which have become so well known as hardly to be appreciated as paintings any more. For Raphael's vision of the Holy Virgin has been adopted by subsequent generations in the same way as Michelangelo's conception of God the Father We see cheap reproductions of these works in humble dwellings, and we are apt to conclude that paintings with such a general appeal must surely be a little 'obvious'. In fact, their apparent simplicity is the fruit of deep thought, careful planning and immense artistic wisdom. A painting like Raphael's 'Madonna dell Granduca', is truly 'classical' in the sense that it has served countless generations as a standard of perfection in the same way as the works of Pheidias and Praxiteles. It needs no explanation. In this respect it is indeed 'obvious'. But, if we compare it with the countless representations of the same theme which preceded it, we feel that they have all been groping for the very simplicity that Raphael has attained. We can see what Raphael did owe to the calm beauty of Perugino's types, but what a difference there is between the rather empty regularity of the master and the fullness of life in the pupil! The way the Virgin's face is modeled and recedes into the shade, the way Raphael makes us feel the volume of the body wrapped in the freely flowing mantle, the firm and tender way in which she holds and supports the Christ Child - all this contributes to the effect of perfect poise. We feel that to change the group ever so slightly would upset the whole harmony. Yet there is nothing strained or sophisticated in the composition. It looks as if it could not be otherwise, and as if it had so existed from the beginning of time

25934-foundati.jpg	History was not kind to the Emilian painter Melozzo da Forli, since his only work that survives in excellent condition is this group portrait executed in fresco for the Vatican Palace. The reigning pope, Sixtus IV, seated on the right, is shown in the company of several individuals, including two of his nephews. The standing figure in the centre of the composition facing Sixtus can be identified as his nephew Giuliano, later Pope Julius II. Melozzo's manner recalls that of Mantegna, although it is somewhat less insistent and more approachable.The fresco represents the historical event of the foundation of the library in 1475 and the nomination of its first head, Bartolomeo Platina. He is kneeling in front of Pope Sixtus IV, the cardinal standing beside him is Giuliano della Rovere, the future Pope Julius II. The man standing beside the throne is Apostolic Protonotary Raffaello Riario, and behind Platina are Girolamo Riario and Giovanni della Rovere. Platina points his finger to the Latin inscription below

16645-creation.jpg	"This extraordinary panel is widely admired for its brilliant colours, curious iconography, and mystical vitality At the left, God the Father, supported by 12 blue cherubim, flies downward, pointing with his right hand at a circular ""mappamondo"", which fills the lower half of the scene. The representation of earth is surrounded by concentric circles, including a green ring (for water), a blue ring (for air), a red ring (for fire), the circles of the seven planets, and the circle of the Zodiac. On the right, in a separate scene set in a meadow filled with flowers, Adam and Eve walk to the right against a line of seven trees with golden fruit. Their heads turn back toward a naked angel, who expels them from Paradise. Below them spring the four rivers of Paradise, which extend to the base of the picture.This panel is a fragment from the predella of an altarpiece painted for the church of San Domenico in Siena and now in the Uffizi in Florence. Another panel from the same predella is also in the Museum's collection. The influence of the International Gothic style, especially French miniature painting, can be seen in the figures of the angel, Adam, and Eve, and in the details of flora and fauna."

14166-022love.jpg	Fragonard repeated the compositions of the two small pendants known as Love as Folly, and Love the Sentinel numerous times during his career, two pairs are in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. The various versions of the compositions are usually dated to the early 1770s on the basis of style. Their light colour scheme, rapid brushwork, and lighthearted subjects are similar to numerous paintings, often in oval format, that Fragonard produced in the years around 1770. During this period he was at work on his most celebrated cycle of decorative paintings, the large canvases called the Progress of Love, painted around 1771-72 at the request of Madame du Barry for her pleasure pavilion at Louveciennes outside Paris and now in the Frick Collection, New York. The present works related closely to two of four overdoors associated with this commission.These compositions and their variants typify the kind of quickly painted, small-scale decorative pictures that Fragonard frequently produced during his career

26156-38sorrow.jpg	The Man of Sorrows is shown half-length against a heavily darkened, greenish-blue background. His figure cuts across a grey, moulded stone frame painted in trompe-l'oeil, which gives it the appearance of emerging from the painting three-dimensionally. This is an established illusionistic effect already used by Van Eyck for his niche figures (Annunciation, Madrid, Fundaci�n Thyssen-Bornemisza) but which was first applied to living figures by Memling in the Portinari portraits in New York. The devotional type of the suffering Christ who displays the wounds inflicted by his death on the Cross in order directly to engage the compassion of the believer is a familiar one in fifteenth-century Northern European art. The Man of Sorrows with the angels of the Last Judgment (1444-46) by Petrus Christus (Birmingham, City Art Gallery) is a direct precursor. Memling developed several other variations on this traditional typological theme

13767-gonzaga.jpg	After the death of her husband, Alfonso II, duke of Ferrara, in 1598, Margherita Gonzaga returned to Mantua. There, following the example of other virtuous noble widows, she dedicated herself to pious and charitable activities, the most impressive of which was the founding of a new convent dedicated to St Ursula. Margherita obtained permission for Antonio Maria Viani, Vincenzo I's  Prefect of Building Works, to be allowed to take on the remodeling of the convent and to plan the new construction of the attached church. Some years later she asked Ferdinando Gonzaga, the son of Vincenzo to allow Fetti to work for her at the convent. He executed several works for the church and convent, the two most important are the big lunettes representing The Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes and Margherita Gonzaga Receiving the Model of the Church of St Ursula from Antonio Maria Viani, now in the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua.

05456-7adorati.jpg	Botticelli probably executed this painting while still in Rome. An intimation that the picture was perhaps done during Botticelli's stay in Rome can be seen in the groom in the background on the right who is attempting to bring his horse under control; Botticelli probably adapted this motif from the classical sculptures of the Dioscuri, the horse-tamers, in Rome.In contrast to Botticelli's earlier versions of the Adoration, the Virgin and the Christ Child now form the painting's main focal point, uncontested by any of the figures accompanying them. As in the Adoration done for Guasparre del Lama, those present here are arrayed around the Virgin in a semicircle; in this picture, however, Botticelli has opened up the semicircle towards the observer, so that the latter's gaze may reach the Virgin unhindered. At the same time, all those involved, their postures and gestures, are directed towards the Mother of God, lending the painting a dramatic unity which the earlier Adorations lacked. The artist's recording of the figures' various reactions demonstrates once again the importance for Botticelli of Alberti's treatise on painting. The art theoretician recommended for the edification of the observer not only the greatest variation in the possible palette of emotions but also the depiction of people of differing age, together with alternation in the perspectives offered by the figures, who should be presented from various sides in three-quarter and half profile or from the front. Botticelli's wealth of variation in the fashioning of his figures fulfilled all of these demands, yet without losing the central focus of the picture's content.

12387-youngman.jpg	Pierre Dumonstier (Dumoustier) was a member of a large painter family working in the 16th-17th centuries. They carried on the tradition of the Clouets into the middle of the 17th century. About a dozen members of the family are recorded and several of them held court appointments.In this portrait the artist used very soft brushstrokes, therefore the structure of the canvas can be seen through the paint. He demonstrates an astonishing freedom, preferring simplicity and faithfulness to the model over idealization, and makes no effort to conceal his rapid painting manner. The resulting impression of freshness and modernity is intensified by the audacious composition with its cut-off edges

On a very dark night with deep shadows and without any indication of artificial light, a soldier wearing a helmet and armor appears from the left. He is turning his face so far round to the maid that it gets swallowed up by the darkness. The maid herself, her face obscured by the soldier's shadow, is peering at the soldier from close quarters. She is pointing her left hand at St Peter, who is holding both hands against his chest in a gestion of confirmation. For the apostle, Caravaggio has chosen a model who would be ideal for an old satyr or for Socrates. The artist usually  introduced heads like this for executioners.

38655-boy_flea.jpg	With Pieter de Hooch and Johannes Vermeer, Gerard ter Borch is one of the most outstanding of Dutch genre painters. Their paintings are based on close observation of their contemporaries and their surroundings, and yet elements from everyday life are often combined to suggest a particular mood, create an intriguing situation or point a moral.Ter Borch, the son of a painter, was born in Zwolle and trained there in the studio of his father and also in the Haarlem workshop of the landscape painter Pieter Molijn. In his youth he travelled widely in Europe - to Germany, Italy, England, France and Spain. By 1654 he had settled in Deventer in his native province of Overijssel, where he achieved great professional success. He also became one of the town's regent class, serving as a councillor and painting a group portrait of his fellow regents.In the genre scenes of his early years ter Borch depicted the life of soldiers but after settling in Deventer his paintings often showed elegant interiors in which small groups of figures talk, drink and make music. In this painting ter Borch shows a humbler setting and a mundane subject and yet he treats with the same delicacy and refinement the depiction of the differing textures of fur, hair, wood and felt. As with the painting of the lace-maker by Netscher, the painting gives an almost monumental quality to an everyday situation.

05803-3entombm.jpg	One of the leading Netherlandish artists of his time, Bouts lived in Leuven, where he furnished paintings for the town hall, and executed both private devotional pictures and altarpieces.The Entombment is remarkably well preserved considering its fragile technique. The picture was probably part of a series of scenes from the life of Christ forming a large shuttered altarpiece, and may have been painted on a lightweight cloth support, rolled like a carpet for export to Italy, where it was recorded in the nineteenth century. Like many such works, it has painted borders, which would have served as a guide to re-stretching the picture once it reached its destination.The paint layers, composed of pigment mixed in a water-soluble glue medium, were applied directly onto the fabric, so that they sank into it. The retention of moisture by the canvas enabled the painter to blend the brushwork to achieve smooth transitions, an effect which Bouts has used with greatest subtlety in the landscape. Details, however, had to be added with a light touch so as not to redissolve the first paint layers, and the modelling of the faces, for example, is reinforced with rapid hatching. Although the colours would never have had the brilliance of oils, some pigments have discoloured: parts of the sky which were protected by an earlier frame can be seen to be more blue than those below, which have accumulated surface grime.The burial of Christ after the crucifixion is described in the Gospels and retold in more pathetic detail in the devotional literature of the time. For greater immediacy, the figures are dressed in contemporary clothes. Bouts carefully differentiates the grief of each one. The three Maries are shown from the front, from the left and from the right, their eyes all downcast. One wipes her tears, another covers her mouth, the third holds Christ's arm to place it gently in the tomb. She is supported by John who casts a lingering last look at his Master. Joseph of Arimathea holds Christ's shoulders, reverently touching the body only through the linen cloth, like a priest at Mass holding up the host. Nicodemus, a secret follower of Jesus, lowers the feet into the tomb, while the repentant sinner, Mary Magdalene, looks up into the face of Christ - the only one of the women to lift her eyes. Christ's body is carefully turned so that we may see the wound in his side and the blood, which also refers to the Eucharist. The artist's intentions are clear. He sought to arouse, in a viewer kneeling at the altar preparing to receive the body of the Saviour, those same feelings of grief and wonder which we can still see in the painted figures

44061-2lamenta.jpg	"The latest studies attribute this Lamentation directly to Rogier van der Weyden, a pupil of the Master of Fl�malle and one of the most important and influential of the Flemish Primitives. The style and pictorial qualities of the painting match those of other Van der Weyden panels that are documented by archival material. A few authors, however, believe this Lamentation to be by his workshop, because of the various versions that exist of this composition, some of which have definitely been produced by assistants. Van der Weyden had so much work that he left the reproduction of popular compositions like the Lamentation to the other painters in his workshop. Dendrochronological research - the dating of a wooden panel based on the growth rings - places this version at around 1441, i.e. relatively early in the painter's career.Depicted is the lamentation of Christ under the cross, a scene that does not appear as such in the Bible. To the left we see John the Evangelist, barefoot and robed in a red mantle. His right hand supports the Saviour's upper body, which is resting against the Virgin's knee. With his left hand he is comforting Mary. The Mother of God supports her Son's limp head and presses her cheek against his. At Christ's feet Mary Magdalen kneels in veneration, alongside her an ointment pot, her customary attribute. The skull in the foreground refers to the location, Golgotha, literally ""place of the skull"". Apocryphal texts frequently interpret this as the skull of Adam, whose fall brought death on the human race, and whose original sin Christ died to expiate. The withered trees to the left and right are also taken from medieval Passion stories, certain of which tell that all trees withered when the Saviour gave up the spirit.The emotional intensity of the Lamentation witnesses to the influence of 'devotio moderna', with this type of tableau intended to move the viewer to compassion. Closer contemplation of the Passion would then lead to the imitation of Christ, or place the viewer into the right frame of mind to receive communion"

The fate of the hair-covered members of the Gonzalez family is noted for its reputation as a natural wonder. They were considered animals, who were both marvelled at and presented as gifts. Father and son, at least, turned their condition to a certain prestige and material advantage.Born around 1537 on the Canary Island, the hispanized and baptized Pedro was presented in his infancy as a gift to the French King, Henry II. The king arranged his marriage to Catherine who did not suffer from the syndrome.

20259-singeri6.jpg	"Singerie is the French word for ""Monkey Trick"". It is a genre depicting monkeys apeing human behaviour, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild satire. Singeries were popular among French artists in the early 18th century, though the term is most usually reserved for a type of decorative painting associated with French Rococo. It originated with the French decorator and designer Jean Berain, who included dressed figures of monkeys in many of his arabesque wall decorations. The emergence of singerie as a distinct genre, however, is usually attributed to the decorator Claude III Audran, who in 1709 painted a large picture of monkeys seated at table for the Ch&#226;teau de Marly. In France the most famous such rococo decor are Christophe Huet's Grande Singerie and Petite Singerie decors at the Ch&#226;teau de Chantilly.The six canvases by Huet, which depict monkeys dressed up as humans and engaged in various country leisure activities, originally formed part of the decor of a salon in the Ch&#226;teau de La Norville. The salon had paneling by the sculptor Nicolas Pineau, which framed the six singeries. In his design, Pineau positioned four of the canvases - The Fishermen, The Dance, The Picnic, and the Concert - as overdoors, while installing the remaining two - The Painter and The Sculptor - above pier glasses"

02621-06arella.jpg	In this painting, a bulbous glass vase of flowers stands on a bare rock outcrop, a feature that links the bouquet with the outdoors, despite the fact that it is viewed against a nondescript background of a light, neutral colour.Arellano's flower pieces are carefully orchestrated in terms of colour. His arrangements are usually composed of flowers in the primary colours - red, yellow and blue - with white blooms. The artist also habitually painted with high quality pigments and achieved saturated hues of considerable intensity, which gave his paintings great impact and a high degree of legibility when they shared the wall with other works in the richly decorated interiors of contemporary collectors. Unusually among Spanish flower painters, he frequently employed the expensive mineral pigment lapis lazuli in his blue flowers.Although Arellano absorbed some of the lessons of Italian and indeed Flemish flower painting, this mature work demonstrates that he developed a style that was entirely his own. The existence of a simplified replica of this painting (Madrid, Caja Madrid) demonstrates that the painter repeated successful compositions for the wide market to which his art appealed.

19865-4more.jpg	Sir Thomas More (1477-1535) was  humanist and statesman, chancellor of England (1529-32), who was beheaded for refusing to accept King Henry VIII as head of the Church of England. He is recognized as a saint by the Roman Catholic church. He was the most important patron of Holbein during his first stay in London.Along with Colet and Linacre, More was one of the moving spirits of the revival of learning and letters in the early years of Henry VIII's reign. The King himself seemed to presage a new civilized age and was keen to attract foreign artists and intellectuals to embellish his extrovert court; Erasmus himself was tempted to stay in England but finally refrained.Holbein presents the public figure, robed in authority (for all his saintly reputation More was ferocious enough to condemn heretics to be burnt). The determined severity of countenance betrays little of the retiring scholar, although this is suggested in the figure's slight stoop. More was certainly concerned with the impression he made, insisting on having the flamboyant cuffs on his official costume replaced by ascetic plain ones.When this portrait was painted in 1527, More held the office of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He had been knighted in 1521. It is not known whether the golden chain of office made of S-shaped links was bestowed on him on this occasion or earlier, in 1517, when he first entered the king's service, the chain indicating the willing submission of the wearer. It is typical of Holbein's method that the half length figure composition repeats the tried-and-tested composition of the Venus and Lais pictures. The colours used in More's portrait, however, give the composition an entirely different mood.The fine drawings made prior to the painting show a new delicacy of touch prevalent in the artist's manner after his visit to France; greater attention to the texture of material, fur and velvet was the painterly consequence. The emergence of complementary red and green tonalities to stress spatial values is apparent, but is more straightforward here than its usage in Holbein's second English period.In the Royal Collection, Windsor, there is a preparatory drawing for this painting. Several copies of the painting exist in different collections. The copy in the Prado, Madrid, was made by Rubens during his stay in England in 1529/30

22568-3druisa.jpg	The scene depicting St John the Evangelist Resuscitating Drusiana is on the left wall of the chapel. This miracle is described in the Golden Legend.

The event takes place in the foreground, there are groupings of onlookers left and right. The background is like a theatre backdrop, a cityscape filled with towers, gates, and church fa�ades that are more evocative of central Italy than classical antiquity.

20448-pom_occo.jpg	The escutcheon hanging from the branch tells us that this is Pompeius Occo: a man from East Friesland who had become an Amsterdam banker and merchant with international connections, a humanist and a prominent citizen, and also King Christian II of Denmark's diplomatic representative in the Netherlands. Jacobsz portrayed the banker as a self-assured individual. His attributes - a skull and a carnation - are references to Occo's religion, in which this earthly existence is merely transient but there is hope of eternal life.

38511-2coral_f.jpg	For many years of his life Agostino Tassi was exiled in Livorno, and, as a further punishment for some unknown crime, he also spent some time on a galley. His firsthand knowledge of the sea, boats, shipyards and fishing is evident in his paintings. He might even have observed coral fishing while living in Tuscany. From at least 1612 he knew and admired Adam Elsheimer's work, but it was only in c. 1620 that he began to be strongly influenced by the German painter. Here the light shining on boats and sails, the radiant glow of fire, the accents of red and the careful reflections in the water are all derived from Elsheimer's example. During his lifetime Tassi was celebrated for his nocturnes. Possibly The Coral Fishers was meant to be a night scene, since the silvery glow that permeates the canvas could be interpreted as moonlight. Stylistically the painting is rather close to the lunettes in Palazzo Chigi-Odescalchi, documented in 1623, and to two drawings (Mus�e du Louvre, Paris), which in the past were attributed to Filippo Napoletano.In comparison with The Embarkation of a Queen, The Coral Fishers is much more painterly. For instance, both the figures and the boats, which are carefully delineated in the Embarkation, are here rendered with a quick touch of the brush. The device of the screen of trees occupying a large part of the composition was a favourite of Tassi's in the 1620s and 1630s and reappears in the early works of Claude Lorrain

14557-05nighto.jpg	Fuseli did a total of four variations on The Nightmare, probably his best-known theme. The example in Frankfurt is the second variation. Though the motif was not inspired by any specific literary model, it would be unthinkable without a knowledge of ghost stories, especially English ones. The figure of the woman lying asleep or unconscious is extremely elongated and distorted, not because Fuseli could do no better, but in order to visualize the horrible oppressiveness of the gnome crouched on the woman's breast, a nightmare and incarnation of unconscious terrors. In the gap between the curtains in the background appears the ghostly head of a blind horse, which anticipates the demoniac aspect given this animal especially in later French Romanticism

23635-colonna.jpg	The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).The modernization of the interiors was begun in the Appartamento Estivo on the ground floor of the palace. The picture shows one of the halls where the walls are decorated with wall-high simulated openings presenting views of either Arcadian, idyllic countryside or stormy and peaceful seascapes. The painted architecture is the work of Giovanni Battista Magno, while the fourteen landscapes are by Gaspard Dughet

19249-stillif8.jpg	This signed and dated canvas depicts a serving table with plates of sweets, olives and cheese, a glass vessel of water, and a terracotta jar. In this still-life, the painter subtly manipulated a series of forms (edibles and utensils) all derived from primary geometric shapes (circles, spheres and cylinders) and played these against the reticular articulation of the tablecloth and the receding rectangular tabletop. Tabletop still-lifes were produced by such early seventeenth century Northern artists as Nicolaes Gillis, Floris van Dyck and Clara Peeters. Van der Hamen was beginning to make table-top still-lifes at the end of his life.

These scenes had usually been boudoir pictures, however, private paintings and therefore private subjects. In the nineteenth century these subjects enter more frequently into the public sphere. Views of the (wholly invented) Harem offered a sexually exoticized, and some argue inherently politicised, new subject in Orientalism, a new genre.Chass�riau painted three Harem interiors after his trip to North Africa, the first dated 1849, and the last 1854; the painting here is dated between these two dates.

06051-preachin.jpg	Breenbergh made contact with Lastman straightaway after his return to Amsterdam from Rome. That he was impressed by Lastman's paintings can be seen in the distinct Lastmanian character of the crowd of figures in his The Preaching of St John the Baptist. But his own contribution to the painting of the religious subject (one of the most popular in seventeenth-century Holland, probably because of the importance the Dutch placed on preaching the word of the Gospel) is new, and more significant. It is evident in his skilful integration of the figures into the vast panoramic Italianate landscape, his full control of light and atmospheric effects, and the pronounced accent provided by huge imaginary classical ruins inspired by the remains of the Colosseum

03569-03reale.jpg	Beaumont's contribution to the painting of the Palazzo Reale includes, in addition to four living rooms, two galleries, of which the Galleria della Regina, later named after him, is one of the largest (60 m long) and the most magnificent of its kind. In 1833, it was separated from the palace complex, and has since served as the Armeria Reale, housing the Savoyard weapon collection.The subject of the ceiling painting in the Galleria is the legend of Aeneas, the mortal son of Venus who escaped from the burning Troy with his father and his son, and after many trials and misadventures landed at last at the mouth of the Tiber. There he became through his son Ascanius the progenitor of the gens Julia.The scenes in the large picture panels documents the most important stations on Aeneas's adventurous path.

This is corroborated by the Duke of Urbino, who, in a letter he wrote on May 2nd 1536, simply described it as the ""lady in the blue dress"". The painting gains its opulent, sensuous appeal mainly from its masterful combination of colour values, from the blue dress with red sleeves, through to the flesh tones and the golden brown, skillfully plaited hair"

17190-cypres01.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 612, JH 1731.After leaving Holland and moving to France, van Gogh had attempted to situate himself in relation to such Parisian painters as Bernard and Gauguin. He had corresponded and exchanged work with the former and, in a sense, studied with the latter in late 1888. He felt that they all three shared a dissatisfaction with Impressionism and its successors and a common purpose in creating what he called 'la peinture consolante' - painting of consolation. In June 1889 van Gogh painted a picture he called Starry Sky, an imaginative composition, not painted from nature or the motif but composed from various sights and scenes of Brabant and Provence. He offered it to Bernard and Gauguin as his demonstration of a new form of religious painting. Both ignored the picture and thus overlooked van Gogh's most ambitious painting in his French period, which had been conceived with reference to their joint concerns. Van Gogh responded to this cruel blow by angrily rejecting their work and the directions they had encouraged him to take.

28707-anthony.jpg	The Scuola del Santo in Padua, the house where the brotherhood of St Anthony met, was on the edge of the square in front of the church in which the famous Franciscan saint was buried. This lay confraternity united mainly traders, merchants and artisans who assembled for regular services and mutual social welfare. The Sala Capitolare served for the meetings of the male members, and the older room on the ground floor was allocated to the women. A lavish decoration of the upper hall was begun in 1508 with painted ornaments on the coffered ceiling. At the same time they added wood paneling, armoires, and benches that covered the lower part of the walls. The remaining surface of the walls above this was divided into fields by wooden pilasters, and beginning in 1509it was frescoed by various painters - in the tradition of the older 'scuola' decorations in Venice and Padua. Within a few years a cycle of at least twelve episodes from the life and work of St Anthony had been completed.The painters of the fresco decoration were Giovanni Antonio Requesta (known as Corona), Filippo da Verona, Tiziano Vecellio, Francesco Vecellio, Girolamo Tessari (known as Girolamo del Santo), Bartolomeo Montagna, and Domenico Campagnola. The room owes its fame in the history of Italian art to three of the paintings: the frescoes Titian produced for the brotherhood in 1511.Scenes with St Anthony are found on all four walls of the room. The history cycle paintings immediately to the left and right of the altar on the altar wall show Anthony using his eloquence for the well-being of Padua. In the left fresco he is seen soon after his arrival in Padua, preaching to establish peace among the citizens of the city; in the right painting he is calming and converting the tyrant Ezzelino, who represented a threat to Padua from outside. These frescoes were executed by Corona.To the left of the altar wall, on the long entrance wall, follows a series of miraculous cures by Anthony. The scenes are: The Miracle of the Jealous Husband (Titian); The Healing of the Wrathful Son (Titian); St Anthony Heals a Child who Has Fallen into Boiling Water (Girolamo del Santo, divided into two by the window); Resurrection of a Murdered Man (Bartolomeo Montagna); The Death of St Anthony (18th-century addition); Resurrection of a Drowned Girl (Domenico Campagnola); Resurrection of a Drowned Child (Domenico Campagnola).The end wall (opposite to the altar wall) shows the saint's three most famous miracles: The Miracle of the Newborn Child (Titian); The Miracle of the Miser's Heart (Francesco Vecellio); The Miracle of the Host (Francesco Vecellio).The right wall to the altar (the second long wall) depicts, between three windows, four events that took place only after the saint's death: St Anthony Appears to the Blessed Luca Belludi (Filippo da Verona); The Death of St Anthony (Girolamo del Santo); Recovery of the Relic of St Anthony's Jawbone (Bartolomeo Montagna); Miracle of the Glass (Girolamo del Santo).The picture shows Bartolomeo Montagna's painting on the second long wall. In 1350 Cardinal Guido di Monfort removed the saint's jawbone from his grave, and is kept in a reliquary bust to this day

39562-02adulte.jpg	Christ and the Adulteress depicts the gospel story in which Christ was challenged by the Pharisees to condemn a woman caught in the act of adultery. Although formerly widely considered to be by Giorgione, it is now generally held to be by the young Titian. Its revolutionary character is clearly evident when seen against the background of the artistic tradition represented by Giovanni Bellini. Fifteenth-century compositions, even those with narrative subjects, tended to be calm and static. Here, by contrast, poses and gestures are bold and vehement, the figures possess a new physical robustness, and the colours of the draperies are glowingly sensuous. Whereas fifteenth-century pictures were typically painted on the smooth, glassy surface of primed and polished wood, this - like virtually all of Titian's subsequent work - is painted on the more uneven surface of canvas, and the oil paint applied with more visible brushstrokes.This painting was originally some 50 cm wider than it is now, as is evident from an early copy which shows the additional figure of a man wearing highly fashionable striped hose; the portrait-like head survives as a fragment, also now in Glasgow

The juxtaposition of young and old, which is a frequent motif in Dutch art, is in this case quite fortuitous.

Nevertheless the people portrayed are in one respect different from the tillers of the land usually seen in Dutch peasant genre : they are drawn on a larger scale.

34204-apollo.jpg	"""Oh, what is my repentance ! Oh, a flute is not worth all that ! Despite his cries, his skin is torn off his whole body; (..) his naked muscles become visible; a convulsive movement trembles the veins, lacking their covering of skin."" (Ovid: Metamorphoses, Book VI, verses 386-390). This is how Apollo punishes Marsyas, the satyr who dared to question the superiority of the melody of the divine lyre over the worldly sensuality of his flute.This masterpiece by Jusepe de Ribera was painted in 1637, when his style had reached maturity. The passage from Ovid's Metamorphoses depicted here is the fruit of the aesthetic atmosphere that prevailed at Naples, considered the capital of painting of the time. It is in this context that the painter highlights the confrontation between the divine and the earthly, with the form of representation underlining the content. From his Caravaggesque beginnings, Rivera preserved the expressiveness and the modelling provided by chiaroscuro. But the contrasts characterising this manifestation of Neapolitan Baroque are no longer limited to the clashes of light. De Ribera goes further, achieving a sense of the tragic through every item in the canvas. Like Caravaggio, he made use of popular sources and of real life situations in order to represent the expression of faith. In this way his paintings of figures who, like Marsyas, could have come from the alleyways of Naples, had already achieved renown right across Europe.The figure of the god is marked by the classicism which was then in fashion in Naples. His anatomical perfection, his youth and his idealised beauty are surrounded by flowing, airy draperies which accentuate the diagonal thrust of the composition. In the spirit of the baroque, the roughness of Marsyas' body and the shape of the tree contrast with this classicism. As in his famous depictions of martyrs, Ribera places the victim foreshortened in the foreground. The structure is balanced by a group of forest inhabitants who watch on powerless as the god bears down on his victim"

39078-01planet.jpg	Giovanni Battista Tiepolo was the most famous Italian painter of the 18th century. His greatest achievement was the decoration of two rooms in the palace, or Residenz, of Carl Philipp von Greiffenklau, prince-bishop of W�rzburg, carried out between 1751 and 1753. This painting is the oil sketch presented by Tiepolo on April 20, 1752, for the vast fresco over the staircase of the palace. It shows Apollo about to embark on his daily course across the sky; the deities around him symbolize the planets, and the allegorical figures on the cornice represent the four continents of the world. Numerous changes were made between the oil sketch and the fresco, but this painting shares with the completed ceiling the feeling for airy space, sun-washed colours, and the prodigious inventiveness for which Tiepolo is admired

22798-triptych.jpg	The Virgin Mary sits as the Virgin of Humility on the flowery grass carpet of a hortus conclusus, the enclosed garden of Paradise. This garden is surrounded by a fortified wall, thus turning Mary into a fortress of virginity. The flowers on the lawn, the white and red roses around the Virgin's head and the red rose she is giving to the Child are common symbols of her virginity, her joy and sorrow, as well as the future suffering of Christ. Small dark blue angels crown her as the Queen of Heaven. In keeping with the Cologne tradition, the scene is flanked by standing saints, in this case St John the Evangelist and St Paul. With Lochner's Virgin of the Rose Garden (Cologne, Wallraf-Richartz-Museum), this compositional type may be considered the archetype of Memling's paradisiacal Virgins (e.g. in the Prado, Madrid). The coronation of the Virgin by dark blue angels is another motif developed by Memling, as in his Kansas City Virgin or the St John altarpiece (Memlingmuseum, Bruges).It is difficult to make out whether the work was partly executed by Lochner himself. The wings are usually attributed to another hand. The work could have originated in Lochner's studio in c. 1445-50

19907-05edward.jpg	Edward VI (1537-1553), king of England and Ireland from 1547 to 1553, was King Henry VIII's only legitimate son; his mother, Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, died 12 days after his birth. Although Edward has traditionally been viewed as a frail child who was never in good health, some recent authorities have maintained that until several years before his death he was a robust, athletically inclined youth. His tutors found him to be intellectually gifted, a precocious student of Greek, Latin, French, and theology. On Jan. 28, 1547, Henry VIII died and Edward succeeded to the throne. He died in 1553 at the age of 15.Edward stands behind a parapet and against a monochrome background of bright blue that has turned greeny-brown over the centuries. He raises his right hand in a quasi-majestic wave to the viewer, while in his left hand he holds a priceless gold rattle that is reminiscent of a royal sceptre. The rich, lustrous red gown with gold brocaded sleeves also indicates the princely status of the child.The baby prince looks considerably more mature than his two years would warrant and, as in the previous portrait, his pose echoes the regal authority of his father. The gesture of the hands, found in Renaissance depictions of the infant Christ blessing onlookers, has another resonance. Holbein may have intended to legitimize the English Crown's new religious role by endowing it with the forms religious art could no longer pursue in Protestant England.Painted on oak panel, the apparently conventional design is enlivened by the shadow behind and to the left, and the rich red, brown and gold colour combination gives a mellow impression of prescient childhood. The skill in the foreshortening of the right hand's extended fingers distracts somewhat from the flat facial features - a characteristic of Holbein's royal portraiture

34045-2renoi25.jpg	Renoir was especially close to Monet, both personally and in his aesthetics. For him, though, the human figure rather than landscape was always the main focus of attention. For his female models he always sought out girls of ampler proportions in his Montmartre neighbourhood, many of them sempstresses by trade. They liked posing, and had nothing against indulging a lover who could pay,either. Renoir liked them. Without troubling over questions of morality and society, he glorified the beauty and sensuality he saw in them.Renoir admiration for French 18th-century masters such as Watteau, Boucher and Fragonard, whom he copied in his own youthful days as a porcelain painter, lay behind erotic pictures such as Anna. This nude is entirely natural, neither coquettish, nor provocative. Renoir's colourist subtlety tenderly recorded nuanced shades in the flesh of this woman sitting on the edge of a lilac patterned armchair in front of a sketchy background of what seem to be white undergarments against darker plum black. The interplay of lighter and darker areas is as important in lending the composition its baroque dynamism as are the turned and arrested position of the body or the red highlighting on the chair, lips and the corners of the eye

24894-crucifix.jpg	The mysterious author of this Crucifix (no. 434 in the Uffizi) is one of the most interesting personalities in 13th-century Florentine painting, although recent studies lead us to believe that he had some artistic training in Lucca, almost certainly at the workshop of Bonaventura Berlinghieri.This Cross follows the Byzantine iconographic formula for the 'Christus patiens'. There is a Byzantine influence also in the style, which is, however, basically Western in its dramatic vigour. Referred by some critics to the Florentine school, it is perhaps a work by the painter of the panel with St Francis and scenes of his life in the church of Santa Croce at Florence (Cappella Bardi). This master interprets with a new, passionate vigour the schemes given by the Lucchese Bonaventura Berlinguieri in his St Francis at Pescia.In this panel the artist concentrated on the dramatic moment of the agonies of Christ, giving life to an extraordinary expressive force and great emotional impact. Nevertheless, the most  interesting innovations concern the unusually numerous scenes of the Passion of Christ - four on each side of the Cross. In them the anonymous master shows that he possessed a marked compositional capacity, enabling him to produce very crowded, bustling representations, animated by lively, gesticulating characters.

35495-27mythol.jpg	In Greek mythology Silenus is a rural god, one of the retinue of Bacchus, a gay, fat old drunkard who was yet wise and had the gift of prophecy.In Rubens' painting he is shown drunkenly tottering, his belly swollen with meat and drink, and supported by a disparate collection of dotards, drunkards, blacks, children and young women. The careless inebriation of this bacchanal is expressed by a thicker touch that conveys the unwieldy weight of the drinkers' gait.The composition was originally conceived with half-length figures, but was later enlarged by Rubens himself.

With Spitzweg Biedermeier painting as such comes to an end. He is still describing this world, but with the objectivity and distance of the observer. He can invest the seemingly idyllic scenes and subjects with a humour that is often biting. The Poor Poet is and apt example of this.Three versions of the Poor Poet are known. It is thought that Etenhuber (1720-82), a poet living in impoverished circumstances in Munich, was the model. Spitzweg shows the poet writing in bed to keep warm, for there is snow outside on the roofs and he has no wood to heat the stove.

20670-excavati.jpg	Antiquity was the great theme in British painting in the last decades of the 18th century.  Its influence can be traced in two areas particularly - in literature, which often comes close to the macabre, and in the excavations of antique sites, which were followed with intense interest at the time. Thomas Jones' painting , documenting one of these excavations, gives an example of the latter. It may be the site of the Villa Montalto in Rome, where the Termini railway station now stands. Sites like these attracted the British travelers on the Grand Tour, and soon a fever for collecting developed that dominated elegant taste throughout Europe

If the elements of the composition are first and foremost objects of painterly interest, they also symbolize victory over the earthly life through faith. The bread and wine can be interpreted as Eucharistic symbols of the Body and Blood of Christ, red currants are a familiar symbol of the Passion, and cherries were considered heavenly fruits of Paradise.

13967-idealand.jpg	The Ideal Landscape near Rocca Canterana of the year 1818 is one of Fohr's best-known paintings. To a greater extent than many other Nazarenes, Fohr turned to the tradition, cultivated since the eighteenth century, of a stylised depiction of nature derived from the classical ideal. The composition shows a rocky pastoral landscape in the central mountains of Italy. In the foreground, a path winds past craggy rocks and old, gnarled trees. Walking along it is a festively clad country girl with a child in her arms, holding the hand of another child balancing a jug on her head. To the right, under the trees, a group of pilgrims passes into a defile, in the direction of a distant, illuminated valley. Ahead of the girl, two shepherds follow the path into the picture, where a peaceful, hilly region rimmed by steep mountains opens out.This painting stands in the tradition of the Arcadian landscape, which emerged in the Renaissance and inspired countless variations on the theme of a paradise on earth - a paradise that, in this case, due to the presence of pilgrims, also makes allusion to the Christian Heaven. By depicting the various stages of walking and wandering, Fohr evokes the transience of all earthly things and the journey into the future, which is the true goal of human existence

Among van der Heyden's numerous depictions of the town hall, not one shows a frontal view of its full fa�ade.

37826-zkite.jpg	Carl Spitzweg, at once master of the fairy tale or the bittersweet anecdote, became one of the most popular of all German painters. Occasionally, he could abandon his illustrational mode in favour of a more spontaneous manner. A major example is found in a small, vertical sketch, Kite Flying, that is close to Constable and the Impressionists in its fresh observation of light, time and motion.
