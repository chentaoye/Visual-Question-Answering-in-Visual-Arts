38910-01martyx.jpg	To the testament of Andrea Stazio, a Venetian nobleman who died in 1722, we owe a cycle of paintings of great importance in the history of Venetian art. The will provided that twelve canvases should be painted for the church of San Stae (Venetian for St Eustace). All similar in size, they depict episodes in the lives of the Apostles and their martyrdom. The commission was given to twelve different Venetian painter, ranging from the aged Nicol&#242; Bambini, then seventy-one, through to Giambattista Tiepolo, almost at the start of his career.All the paintings were completed within a few months, in 1722 and early 1723. The artists were the following in alphabetic order: Antonio Balestra, Nicol&#242; Bambini, Gregorio Lazzarini, Silvestro Manaigo, Giambattista Mariotti, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giambattista Piazzetta, Giambattista Pittoni, Sebastiano Ricci, Giambattista Tiepolo, Angelo Trevisano and Pietro Uberti. They vied with each other to transform the church into a remarkable showcase of currents and developments in eighteenth-century Venetian art.Tiepolo's painting is part of the cycle of the Apostles which as a 'collective exhibition' fortunately remained intact in the choir of the Baroque church San Stae, giving an outline of Venetian painting of the period. The subject of the painting is the martyrdom of St Bartholomew, whose tormentors are on the point of flaying him alive. The awfulness of the scene is matched by the extremely powerful composition which places the writhing body of the saint along the diagonal between the two henchmen. The eerie contrast between light and shade makes the scene all the more vivid. The expressive gesture with which the despairing saint stretches his arm heavenward transforms the picture into a wonderful depiction of divine grace, the existence of which is already signaled by the bright light emanating from above.This painting was inspired by Piazzetta and is placed opposite his St James in San Stae, and it is almost its mirror image. As in the other work, the structure dynamically offsets conflicting forces, rendered by means of a chiastic arrangement of diagonals and clear contrasts of light and shade

26259-winckelm.jpg	Johann Winckelmann is an archaeologist and an art historian who is regarded as the father of modern archaeology because of his studies of the excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy.He wrote the formative essay, Gedanken �ber die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst (1755; Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks, 1765), in which he maintained, 'The only way for us to become great, or even inimitable if possible, is to imitate the Greeks.' His essay became a manifesto of the Greek ideal in education and art and was soon translated into several languages.

00944-00humil1.jpg	Fra Angelico's earliest paintings are generally dated in the early 1420s. However, it seems likely that several were executed before the 1420s, for they interpret themes associated with Lorenzo Monaco in a style and sensibility closely related to that of the master. They may be attributed to Angelico because of their analogies to paintings from the 1420s known to be by him. A crucial painting for understanding this early period is the Madonna of Humility in St. Petersburg.The theme of the Madonna of Humility originated  in the mid-fourteenth century and surged in popularity through the first few decades of the fifteenth century. It was portrayed time and again by Lorenzo Monaco and his workshop. It shows the Virgin, humbly seated on the ground instead of majestically enthroned, tenderly holding the infant Jesus on her lap. The attribution of this Madonna to Angelico is substantiated by a comparison with the central panel of the San Domenico di Fiesole Altarpiece

39582-15trevis.jpg	The interesting spatial composition of this picture was undoubtedly Titian's own idea, as is the treatment of the figure of Mary, who is wearing a wonderfully draped garment with wide folds, made of a heavy lustrous silk. Numerous scholars have expressed their doubts about the figure of the angel and the kneeling donor Broccardo Malchiostro. In 1526, the citizens of Treviso, animated by a strong dislike of Malchiostro and outrage that he should have had himself so obviously portrayed in an altarpiece &#151; something that was not customary in either Venice or Treviso &#151; smeared pitch across the painting, and the work had to be renovated

05559-10smarco.jpg	Botticelli painted this altarpiece, which is the largest of those works still in existence and which was created for the church of the Dominican monastery of San Marco in Florence. The guild of goldsmiths, which was responsible for the maintenance and decoration of this church, ordered the altar for their own chapel. It was dedicated to their patron saint Eligius. The lavish use of the expensive gold paint was probably due to the identity of the clients, who wanted to make a sumptuous display of their profession. The gold background in the upper part of the painting marks the dividing line between the heavenly and earthly spheres. Nonetheless, both worlds meet within the confines of a single picture, something which was extremely unusual in the painting of the age.The four saints - John the Evangelist, the Fathers of the Church St. Augustine and St. Jerome, and St. Eligius - are standing in a semicircle on a meadow. Behind them, on either side of a lake, is an extensive landscape. As is typical of Botticelli's economical and schematic composition, it is merely a decorative addition to the monumental figures. The coronation of the Virgin in a glory of seraphs and cherubs is all the more lavish. God the Father and the Virgin are enthroned on an airy carpet of clouds, setting them apart from the dancing groups of angels. Two artistic qualities become clear in this heavenly scene: Botticelli's exceptional feeling for the ornamental structuring of forms and his artistic inventiveness. He fits the heavenly aureole into the semicircular top of the picture, which reflects the domed architecture of the Eligius Chapel. He playfully groups the whirlwind round dance of the angels about the heavenly scene and this creates an illusion of depth

17478-4carond1.jpg	The left wing of the diptych represents Jean Carondelet while the right the Virgin and Child. It is signed at the bottom of the right wing: 'Johannes Melbodie Pingebat', and dated at the bottom of the left wing:'Fait l'an 1517. On the frames: various inscriptions referring to the Virgin or indicating the donor.Carondelet is represented half-length, praying before the Virgin; on the back of the portrait is his coat-of-arms, and on the back of the Virgin is a trompe-l'oeil skull, with a pious inscription and the date.Carondelet was born at D�le in 1469, and died at Mechelen in 1545; he was the son of Chancellor Carondelet. He was a church dignitary, holding various offices and benefices, and played a political r�le in the Low Countries. Having entered the Church, he acquired various important posts. From 1497 he was a member of the Grand Conseil pour les affaires du Justice. In 1517 he went to Spain with Charles V, and returned with him to the Low Countries in 1519. In 1531 he became President of the Privy Council. In addition, he acquired numerous ecclesiastical dignities; in 1493 he was Archbishop of Palermo and Primate of Sicily. He was a scholar and a humanist, and a friend of Erasmus, who dedicated his Saint Hilarius to him; evidently he had a liking for having his portrait done, since there are two others of him by Gossart, another by Van Orley, and one by Vermeyen.This work dates from Gossart's mature period; it shows his preoccupation with the sculptured form which he acquired through contact with Michelangelo and antique statues in Rome in 1508. In this year he accompanied Philip of Burgundy, natural son of Philip the Good and Admiral  of the fleet, who was sent as a private ambassador to Philip II. It is assumed that the artist based this painting on some antique bust - Euripides, Socrates, or Julius Caesar. The artist was torn between the Flemish tendency towards naturalism and Italian idealization, as can be seen in his portrayal of the Virgin. For this reason the donor portrait is superior to the other wing, both in truth of life and in pictorial quality; it is, moreover, in a better state of preservation

30114-grotesqu.jpg	Some of the Roman paintings found in the Domus Aurea and elsewhere correspond quite precisely what Vasari and others determined to be the typical features of grotesques. These paintings inspired several ceiling designs 'all'antica' in the first part of the sixteenth century. The desire to revive not only the forms of ancient Roman architecture but also their decoration may help to explain the success of these paintings. In particular, Raphael and the specialist in his workshop, who mastered the genre completely, helped the grotesque style to spread quickly in Rome. This style enjoyed a long-lasting success, which can still be demonstrated even after mid-century. Nevertheless, quite early on the genre developed independently and distanced itself increasingly from ancient models.

Her elderly parents have accompanied her to the bottom of the steps. Many old and young witnesses are present.

30260-s_conver.jpg	In contrast with Lotto, Savoldo, Romanino and Moretto, Jacopo Negretti, known as Palma il Vecchio, worked wholly within the tradition of Venetian painting. Influenced in his early years by the example of the great painters of the fifteenth century, he soon absorbed the lessons of Giorgione's revolution and subsequently fell under the spell of the personality of Titian, with the result that in his paintings of the early 1520s figures and landscape are both rendered in the most sumptuous of colours, both inhabit a calm, restful, sentimental atmosphere whose climate is unchanging and unchangeable. The masterpiece of this phase of his career is undoubtedly this 'Sacred Conversation' which was perhaps the painting which Ridolfi quotes as hanging in the house of the Widmann family in 1648.The canvas reveals utter fidelity to Titian's style of around 1520, above all in the head of St Catherine and the landscape with its castle which some critics believe was finished by Titian himself when the artist from Bergamo died and left some parts of the picture unfinished: for example the left hand of St Catherine and the right hand of St John the Baptist. The spacious, monumental cadence of the rhythms of the figures offers the coloured passages the chance to spread in sumptuous zones defined by the polished refinement of his line, while shapes acquire a clean, plastic integrity through the effect of the limpid play of chiaroscuro. The opulent use of colour to bind the figures together gives clear evidence of Palma il Vecchio's propensity for the recreation of reality in an ideal model, unmoving and unmoved

14259-6corona.jpg	The Sienese Francesco di Giorgio was a dominant painter, sculptor, and engineer of his generation in his native city. Additionally he was a leading architect and designer of castles and fortifications, so it is understandable why there are few paintings by his hand. Like his Florentine and Umbrian contemporaries, he was a student of perspective, which is imaginatively employed in the platform upon which Christ is crowning His eternally young mother.This large and crowded altarpiece was Francesco di Giorgio's most ambitious undertaking in his work as a painter. About 40 characters, each one visually identifiable thank to the artist's careful graphic research, crowd into the main scene. Christ is crowning the Virgin on a strange podium which is held up by angels. Above them, Francesco uses steep perspective to include a whirlwind image of God the Father.The altarpiece depicting the Coronation of the Virgin was painted for the Chapel of Sts Sebastian and Catherine of Siena at Monte Oliveto, hence the prominence of those two in the lowest zone of the picture. Considering Francesco di Giorgio's activity as an architect, it is surprising that there is so little convincing structure to the composition and that the spatial relationships are so difficult to decipher. No single, consistent optimal point of sight where the perspective operates effectively seems to have been planned. As a result, while one might expect to see the two kneeling saints from above or the central group of Christ and Mary from below, they are all seen almost straight on. Christ, the dominant image on the central axis, is in the act of crowning the kneeling and proportionally somewhat smaller Mary. His left arm, thrust across the body, forms a wedge below the nearly diamond-shaped head. A swirling God the Father, surrounded by zodiacal signs and angels, supervises the uppermost zone.Mary and Christ rest upon a flat cloud bank shown in sharp foreshortening (although the figures themselves are not foreshortened). On a ledge in the same zone, seated figures - including St John the Baptist cross-legged on the left and crowned King David holding his lyre on the right - and handsome angels imply a semicircular distribution in space, a compositional innovation that will find reverberations in the following decades. Along the sides, hosts of saints are piled up in the narrow vertical strips, recalling a Sienese tradition that goes as far back as Duccio di Buoninsegna's Maest&#224; of the early Trecento. The spaces are hard to reconstruct; the surfaces are overcrowded; the colour strong although unnatural.Francesco had his artistic and cultural roots in Siena. But just as Sassetta experienced outside, non-Sienese influences, so too did Francesco di Giorgio. His personal style was modified and molded by impulses from two North Italian painters active in Siena, Girolamo da Cremona and Liberale da Verona, both of whom reflected Mantegna's innovative formal style. In addition, Francesco di Giorgio was keenly aware of what was unfolding in nearby Florence. Critics often point out the influence of Filippo Lippi and of Verrocchio, as well as that of the Pollaiuolo shop. Donatello and Ghiberti had left works in Siena which are also reflected by Francesco di Giorgio. The twisting, winged, nude putti of the Coronation, who help support the cloud bank, are modifications of Donatello's tiny angels in the Sienese Baptistry.Francesco di Giorgio constantly disregards the structure of figures or their anatomy. Bodies are usually heavy, arbitrary, and abstract, without special attention to the light sources; for example, the St Dorothy standing on the extreme right edge of the picture with the flowers gathered in her garment. Her long face, accentuated by a strong chin and a wide-eyed expression, is curiously personalized, suggesting deep intensity and even an affliction, often found in Francesco's somewhat melancholy vision. Like Botticelli, his world consists more of fantasy and imagination than of a demanding observation of nature. In the Coronation of the Virgin the unity of the picture is sacrificed to an abundance of detail

38017-minerva.jpg	Stella's art, although sometimes influenced by Poussin in terms of its composition, was often very much more light-hearted. Although he sometimes used Poussinesque figures in his larger compositions, Stella never interested himself in the moral and intellectual side of Poussin's art.The mythological story depicted in this painting is the following.Minerva (Greek Pallas Athena) was one of the major deities of ancient Greece and Rome, and, like Apollo, a benevolent and civilizing influence. In Greek mythology she was the daughter of Jupiter (Zeus), and sprang fully armed from his head. The familiar figure in armour with spear, shield and helmet, the patroness of institutions of learning and the arts, seen in civic heraldry, sculpture and painting, is only one of her many aspects. In an early form she was a war goddess, hence her weapons. She was the patroness of Athens, and the Parthenon was her temple.Ovid describes (Met. 5:250-268) how Minerva visited the Muses on Mt Helicon, their home, to listen to their song and story and to see the sacred spring, the Hippocrene, which flowed from a rock after it had been struck by the hoof of the winged horse, Pegasus. The scene is a wooded mountain-side where the company of Muses are playing their instruments or perusing books. Pegasus is seen in the background.

34930-10berze.jpg	The early twelfth-century wall-painting in the apse of the chapel of the summer retreat of the abbots of Cluny at Berz�-la-Ville - probably a replica of one originally found in the apse of the now-destroyed abbey church of Cluny III - has as its unusual theme the Twelve Apostles combined with the Traditio Legis. In this Christ grants to St Peter the authority to govern the Church, symbolised by the handing over of a scroll; thus Peter is identified as the precursor of the popes.The wall-painting is dominated by the figure of Christ in Majesty in a mandorla. He hands St Peter a scroll granting him authority to govern the church, and is surrounded by the Twelve Apostles. The style of the wall-painting is characteristic of that in Rome and southern Italy at the beginning of the twelfth century, and exhibits the strong influence of Byzantine painting

32331-turco1.jpg	The picture shows a detail of the wall decoration in the Salone Turco in the Palazzo Colonna. The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).Under the sons of Filippo II Colonna (1663-1714) more additions were made to the palace. A new wing was erected between 1730-33 by Nicola Michetti. Of this wing only the corner pavilion has survived unchanged, and in it is one of the loveliest interiors from the Roman Rococo, the Coffeehouse. The most important eighteenth-century additions were completed under Cardinal Girolamo II Colonna (1708-1763). He commissioned Paolo Posi to build a gallery in the highly theatrical style of the eighteenth century. The cardinal's favourite painter was Stefano Pozzi who, together with his brother Giuseppe (1723-1765) and the landscape painter Giovanni Angeloni (1740-1788), painted the doors, mirrors, and wall panels of Girolamo's apartment, the so-called Salone Turco, with cheerful and decorative arabesques and small-format scenes

13908-heliodor.jpg	This Flemish painting refers to a different cultural current from the grand Antwerp works of the Baroque. Whilst the Southern Low Countries were succumbing to Rubens' genius, Li�ge artists were looking towards contemporary Italian and French painters. Returning to Li�ge in 1646 after a long stay in Rome, Florence and Paris, Bertholet Fl�mal imported the Poussinesque ideas that he had soaked up during his trip. Hence there flourished, not far from Antwerp, a Franco-Roman current of which Bertholet Fl�mal is the best representative. (Other artists of this school were Gerard Douffet, J. W. Carlier, Gerard de Lairesse.)Typical of this art, Heliodorus Driven from the Temple must have been intended for an amateur collection. The subject, which prefigures the conversion of St Paul, is taken from the second book of Maccabees (3.22-30). The general Heliodorus had been sent to Jerusalem by the King of Syria to confiscate the sacred treasure of the Temple. Having entered it with his guards, he was carrying out his heinous deed when a horseman and two young men appeared to him. According to the Bible, the horse reared above Heliodorus, whilst the two messengers of God flogged him, at which point the Syrian troops fled. It is this precise moment that Fl�mal illustrates.The main scene, set against a background of imposing antique architecture, groups the various protagonists. The fiery horseman and the general knocked to the floor are inspired by Raphael's fresco adorning the Stanza dell'Eliodoro in the Vatican. The painting captures this precise moment, with the main group thrown into relief by the lively colours, mixed with white highlights and strong shadows. We also note the painter's consummate art in the modelling of the draperies, with their typically tight folds. The composition is balanced, with the central group in the foreground offset on both sides by two secondary groups in the background. To the left prostrate Jews implore heaven to avoid the profanation of the holy place, to the right Heliodorus' soldiers flee empty-handed. The large red curtain, hanging in what is otherwise a void, imparts a sense of space to the composition.Fl�mal never signed or dated his paintings. There is no doubt as to the attribution of this one, which is so characteristic of his art, and can be situated in his mature period, in the late 1650s and early 1660s

09615-cupid.jpg	This is one of the six erotic paintings on mythological themes made by Correggio for Federico II Gonzaga, Lord of Mantua.Correggio's artistic formation was unusually dependent on his geographical origins. Working in Parma, within the larger triangle of Venice, Milan and Rome, he drew on the disparate pictorial traditions of these cities as well as on the Mantuan works of Mantegna and on prints from across the Alps. The blurred contours, veiled transitions from rosy shadow to gold and white highlight and from flesh to feather, and the elusive mood of 'The School of Love' recall Giorgione, but Leonardo's influence is also evident in the exquisitely silky hair, the dreamy smiles, the complex pose of Venus. X-rays reveal major alterations: Mercury and Venus may even have exchanged places. This method of working directly on the canvas derives from Venice. Yet Correggio draws these various elements together in an entirely individual way, partly through his method of composition.

08624-presenta.jpg	"At Jerusalem, it had been revealed to a man named Simeon that he would not see death before he had seen the Messiah. He therefore came to the Temple, led by the Spirit, and as his parents brought in the infant Jesus, Simeon took him in his arms and said: ""Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace ... for my eyes have seen thy salvation"". There was also a very old woman prophetess, Anna, who served God day and night in fasting and in prayer. She too gave thanks to God (Luke 2. 25-38).Philippe de Champaigne places the Gospel story on the Temple steps in front of a portico with Corinthian columns. In the centre, Simeon carries the Child. The way he looks up to heaven and his expressive hand movement testify to the old man's emotion and joy. To the left, Mary and Joseph follow the scene closely, whilst to the right, among the onlookers, the prophetess Anna, symbolising the Synagogue, points to the Messiah with her finger. The two monumental groups of figures are balanced on either side of a central axis, leaving little space for the background d�cor. Philippe de Champaigne is concerned for historical accuracy and respectful of Christian virtues. Nothing is gratuitous for him. The placing of each figure, the gestures and the colour of the garments are governed by a strict symbolism, learned from reading theologians in the spirit of the Council of Trent.This large canvas, painted in 1648 for the high altar of the Church of Saint-Honor� in Paris, is very characteristic of the art of this French painter. Philippe de Champaigne, who was born in Brussels, effectively took French nationality in 1629. The painting is from his mature period, when he had perfectly assimilated the various influences on him. His Flemish training had provided him with an outstanding and fluid mastery of painting technique, and a taste for realism - as seen in the facial and hand expressions - which saved him falling into academism. Indeed, he draws part of his repertory of gestures and attitudes from the model book of Dutchmen Abraham and Frederik Bloemaert. Antique art and Raphael, whom he particularly admired, were other reference points. The clear, light colours are typical of French painting of the 1640s and 50s."

11983-syrinx.jpg	The painting is a depiction of a mythological episode, the story of Pan and Syrinx, as told by Ovid (Metamorphoses, I: 691). The dynamic gesture of Pan, seizing Syrinx with one hand and parting the reeds with the other, and the close-up, di sotto in su viewing point, emphatically set the picture within a spectacular Baroque aesthetic that is typical of the artist's style. The contrast between the milky flesh of Syrinx and the tanned tonality of the satyr, whose body melds into the background from which he emerges, lends a marvellous rhythm to this pair of figures

15951-pieta.jpg	Celebrating the eloquent expression on faces of figures and their gestures, Vasari remembers the altarpiece in the Florentine church of San Remigio: the scene is grouped in the lower part of the painting, with the dead Christ, the Virgin, Mary Magdalen and other saints crying him. On the left the saints Remigio and Benedict with two kneeling women in modern clothes, probably the donors of the picture.The painting is mentioned by Vasari as a work of Giotto di maestro Stefano called Giottino, and not otherwise documented. Certain critics have identified this with Maso di Banco, the author of the stupendous frescoes in the Bardi Chapel at Santa Croce, but it is more probable that we have here a personality of equal worth but distinct. Certain Lombard elements (e.g. the costume of the two figures of the donors) tend to indicate a painter who was familiar with northern painting: and Giottino's father, Stefano, did, in fact, migrate from Florence to Lombardy

20937-lampligh.jpg	Kersting concentrated exclusively on interiors, a genre established in seventeenth-century Netherlandish art. His pictures often show humble, even Spartan working and living quarters, redolent of the concentrated spiritual life led by their inhabitants, who are often occupied with reading. This was Kersting's favourite subject apart from portrayals of his friend, Friedrich, and quite in tune with his unemphatic but delicately coloured compositions.In the present picture, it is the mental world of reading that determines the overall impression. The concentration of the man immersed in his book is echoed in the simplicity of the furnishings and the way the bookshelves serve to delimit the room formally. The light cast by the reading lamp on the empty back wall, where it congeals into strange configurations, becomes an outward expression of the inward illumination that, at that period, forged knowledge into a weapon of the educated German middle class against censorship and suppression of freedom of opinion

15806-laidtabl.jpg	The aesthetically conservative principle of tables arranged strictly parallel to the horizontal edges of the painting was followed by Nicolaes Gillis and Floris Claesz van Dijck. (Predecessors were probably family paintings such as Marten van Heemskerck's.) Their still-lifes are classified as 'ontbijtjes' (breakfast still-lifes). Onbijt(je) was a light meal which could be taken at any time of the day. Strictly speaking, most of the paintings by Gillis and van Dijck are dessert still-lifes, developed at roughly the time by Osias Beert and Clara Peeters.All these artists show a table with a table runner and a carefully ironed, white damask tablecloth whose creases, regardless of the laws of perspective, run in parallel lines towards the back of the painting. A relatively high viewpoint was also chosen, apparently to afford a good overall survey of the objects, which are arranged side by side, or in a circle, hardly ever touching or overlapping. The precious drinking vessels and pieces of textile show very clearly that the arrangement is that of a privileged household.In accordance with etiquette, fruit, pies, nuts and confectionery were served as a dessert. Cheese, which had a central role in Gillis's and van Dijck's art, was also part of the dessert. Gillis and van Dijck build up pyramids of hard cheese in two or three layers: at the bottom there is half a large cheese with a rich, yellow hue, indicating that it is still very young, while on the top the cheeses are smaller and more brownish, almost grey in colour, showing that they are older and more mature. The irregular traces of cuts with a knife - the only piece of cutlery on the table - are rendered extremely well

03046-1young.jpg	The artist is one of the most original and creative figures of the German Renaissance. Born in the village of Schw&#228;bisch-Gmund in south-west Germany, his family established close connections with Strasbourg. It was here that Baldung worked for most of his life, apart from four years in Nuremberg spent in D�rer's workshop (1503-c. 1507) and five years in Freiburg-im-Bresgau (1512-17) where he painted his masterpiece, The Coronation of the Virgin, for the high altar of the M�nster. Baldung was a prolific artist and his oeuvre comprises numerous prints and designs for book illustrations and stained-glass, as well as paintings and drawings. He was the most individual of D�rer's assistants and his style and treatment of colour are remarkably expressive. The range of subject matter in Baldung's work matches his technical dexterity: religious and mythological themes, in addition to a fascination for witches, are vividly, almost shockingly, handled. In achieving this emphatic style, Baldung was influenced by Gr�newald, Cranach, and artists of the Danube school. It is clear that he was inspired by the spirit of the Reformation and this encouraged an element of dualism in his work, most evident during the 1520s. Strasbourg was sympathetic to Reformist ideas and the artist himself was buried in the Protestant cemetery.Portrait of a Young Man with a Rosary is an early work; it is, in fact, the first dated portrait in Baldung's oeuvre, painted on his return to Strasbourg two years after The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian (Nuremburg, Germ&#228;nisches Nationalmuseum). The style, combining linearity with a perfectly controlled understanding of the liquidity of paint, is clearly dependent upon D�rer, especially his portraits including that of Burkhard von Speyer in the Royal Collection, painted while D�rer was in Venice from 1506 to 1507. However, the liveliness of the almost quixotic characterisation is typical of Baldung. At the upper edge in the centre, as part of the signature, is an image of an owl attacking a bird on a branch, which perhaps symbolises the conflict between good and evil or day and night. This piece of symbolism should perhaps be seen in the context of the rosary held by the sitter.The painting was part of the collection of Italian, German and early Netherlandish pictures formed by Prince Ludwig Kraft Ernst von Oettingen Wallerstein (1791-1870), which Prince Albert accepted as surety for a financial loan in 1847. The collection was put on display in Kensington Palace in 1848 in order to encourage a buyer, but this ploy failed and so the pictures came into the possession of Prince Albert. In 1863 Queen Victoria presented twenty-five of the best paintings to the National Gallery, London, in memory of the Prince Consort and in accordance with his wishes. Like several other paintings in the Oettingen Wallerstein collection, Portrait of a Young Man with a Rosary previously belonged to Count Joseph von Rechberg (1769-1833)

42394-cannonsh.jpg	Willem van der Velde the Younger was first trained in the Amsterdam studio of his father, Willem the Elder, who was a distinguished ship 'portraitist'. Willem the Elder specialized in pensehilderijen, pen drawings of ships on panel or canvas made in a manner similar to engravings. Subsequently his son completed his training with Simon de Vlieger, the marine painter, in Weesp. Willem the Younger then joined his father in his studio and continued to live and work in Amsterdam until 1672. In that year, the so-called rampjaar, the French invasion of the Netherlands caused such economic chaos that painters found it difficult to earn a living. (Vermeer was also among the many Dutch artists who experienced financial hardship at this time.)Both father and son moved to England and in 1674 were taken into the service of Charles II: the warrant of appointment states that each is to be paid a hundred pounds a year, in addition to payments for their pictures, the father for 'taking and making of Draughts of seafights' and the son for 'putting the said Draughts into colours'. One important early royal commission was for designs for tapestries commemorating the Battle of Solebay. They lived for the rest of their lives in England, working in their studio at the Queen's House, Greenwich, for Charles II, James II and members of their courts.This study of a man-of-war firing a cannon - as a signal, rather than in battle - was painted in about 1670, shortly before van de Velde left Amsterdam for London. Rather than a seascape, it is essentially a 'portrait' of the ship. In his later years Willem the Younger employed numerous assistants and the quality of his work declined, but this picture is entirely from his own hand and displays the remarkable atmospheric effects of which he was capable.The firing of guns depicted in the present painting was known as a salute shot, a naval tradition well established by the late sixteenth century. A ship, upon entering port, would discharge all its guns to show that they were empty and because the reloading process was so time-consuming, the ship was effectively defenceless as it came into range of the shore batteries. It was, therefore, a recognised indicator of friendly intent. These salutes always involved an odd number of guns as naval superstition held odd numbers to be lucky and an even number of guns was fired only in times of mourning

34993-15clemen.jpg	Apart from the evocations of early Christian models, on which almost all painting in the city of Rome  was based, it was ultimately the local factor of antiquity that determined the character of Romanesque painting in Rome more strongly than anywhere else. The most significant examples of this style are the murals in the lower church of San Clemente, the church dedicated to the pope whose relics are stored there. The scene depicting the miraculous rescue of a child from the sea of Azof by St Clemens was painted by an artist whose style is marked by unusual contours, shining highlights, and especially decorative arrangements. From the depth where the pope's body had been submerged, the legend goes, a marble chapel had arisen. Once a year the masses of water receded, making the chapel accessible to pilgrims. One day a mother last her small child there, but found him again the next year, unhurt. Below this scene we see a medallion portrait of Clemens, flanked by donor figures

32065-cremona4.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. He painted the scenes above the next arch, and continued the cycle on the right wall, where he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.Romanino was commissioned for the next four scenes of the Passion on the right wall. In December 1519 he was commissioned to fresco the three remaining bays of the nave as well. However, the contract was revoked in 1520 and it was awarded to Pordenone. Above each arch there is just one broad field in which he painted Pilate Judges Christ; Carrying the Cross; Christ Nailed to the Cross. In each composition an immense, dense, violent jostling of figures is developed in a relief-like style and from a viewpoint slightly below the action.The narrative folds into the wall of the fa�ade, where the trilogy of the procession to Calvary comes to a close in the enormous fresco of the Golgotha by Pordenone

30404-longneck.jpg	This was painted for the church of Santa Maria dei Servi at Parma. It is the masterpiece of the culminating period in the art of Parmigianino, done almost the same time as the frescoes of the Steccata at Parma. The painter worked upon the picture for six years, but this notwithstanding, it remained unfinished. It is a work of intense if somewhat aloof poetical feeling, this effect mainly arising from the splendid abstraction of the forms, so smoothly rounded under the cool and polished colour.The painting takes its subject from a simile in medieval hymns to the Virgin which likened her neck to a great ivory tower or column. Appropriate to the traditional understanding of the Virgin as an allegorical representation of the Church, this imagery was also exploited in poems. Thus the exaggerated length of the limbs of the Virgin and her son, as well as the presence of columns in the background of the painting, are not contrived merely for their decorative value, but clearly signal the painting's religious meaning

31276-mary_mag.jpg	"The old attribution to Mantegna was corrected in 1874 when the painting was given to Piero di Cosimo. Most scholars have seen the piece as belonging to the first years of the sixteenth century, the last phase of the artist's production; when he was influenced by the Leonardesque movement. A more precise dating has placed this work to 1501, the time of Leonardo's return to Florence. Some scholars, on the other hand, placed the date at around 1490, setting the work among the earliest of a group carried out between 1485 and 1505. In the pictures of this group, the artist reveals a stylistic attachment to Filippino Lippi, toning down the colours for a ""northern accent"", in the manner of Hugo van der Goes.The Magdalene's face has a portrait quality that is notable, especially as such treatment runs counter to the strict observance of the iconography of the saint."

34436-vases_fl.jpg	The symbolic use of flowers in the late Middle Ages is reflected in the paintings by Ludger tom Ring the Younger. The picture shows white lilies in the one painting and golden brown irises in the other. Both vases bear the same Latin inscription, running diagonally downwards. The complete sentence would have read 'IN VERBIS IN HERBIS ET LA[PIDIBUS DEUS]' (God is in words, in plants and in stones). This aphorism summarizes the link, derived from the Bible, between the preaching of God's Word and botanical symbols of salvation. The artist seems to intended these paintings as wall decoration for a pharmacy, as the aphorism can be regarded as a motto which reflects pharmaceutical theory and practice as proclaimed by Paracelsus a quarter of century earlier.The artist studied with his father Ludger tom Ring the Elder, then travelled to the Netherlands, and to England in 1550. He painted mainly portraits, but also still-lifes that were influenced by Dutch artists.

He was one of the most intriguing of the second-rate artists to emerge in the first decades of the sixteenth century. In the Venetian milieu dominated by Titian, he was capable of preserving his singular tone, his powerful, immediate realism, his particular style which incorporated elements from Sebastiano and Titian and sometimes from other artists such as Palma Vecchio and Lorenzo Lotto.This painting, which was attributed to Lucas van Leyden in the seventeenth century, was meant for private devotion and meditation, as its size suggests it

01048-copperco.jpg	The painting, known as the Banquet of Copper Coin, is the earliest example of a group portrait of guardsmen seated round a banquet table. It shows a rather primitive juxtaposition of single portraits. The stiff somewhat geometrical composition is characteristic of the early group pictures, and so is the bird's-eye view of the table. The arrangement is simple. Fifteen of the seventeen guardsmen have been lined up in two rows, with only a weak attempt to bind them together. Some of the men are looking towards the spectator, some of them elsewhere. This variety of movement slightly relieves the monotony of the setting, but it endangers the unity. The relief-like arrangement in planes parallel to the surface is characteristic of the Renaissance style. So is the accentuation of the straight horizontal and vertical directions, both giving a certain architectural firmness to the composition.After the middle of the sixteenth century painters of group portraits adopt a freer arrangement within a more natural space construction

19681-veere.jpg	Jan van der Heyden, who specialized in the painting of townscapes, was born in Gorinchem but moved as a child to Amsterdam. He is said to have been trained by a glass-painter, an apprenticeship which taught him to paint with the extraordinary degree of precision evident in his topographical views. He lived and worked in Amsterdam throughout his life but travelled widely in Holland, Flanders and the Rhineland. He painted many of the towns he visited, producing more that one hundred views of identified places in Holland, as well as of Brussels and Cologne. From the end of the 1660s he was also involved in projects to improve street-lighting and fire-fighting in his native town and provided the illustrations for books on these subjects. In addition to town views, he painted a few landscapes and still lifes.In the seventeenth-century Veere, a small town in the province of Zeeland, on the strait between Walcheren and Noord Beveland, was an important port which carried on an extensive trade with Scotland. It is seen here from the south-west with the tower of the Great Church prominent on the left: the church was extensively damaged by fire in 1686. Traditionally the figures have been attributed to Adriaen van de Velde but in fact are probably by van der Heyden himself. The artist painted a number of views of the town of Veere seen from slightly different points of view but none are dated and there is no record of when van der Heyden visited the town. There is relatively little development in van der Heyden's meticulous and delicate style and his paintings are therefore difficult to date with any precision, but this view was probably painted around 1665

23560-c_pilate.jpg	For four years, between 1648 and 1652, Nicolaes Maes, a native of Dordrecht, was one of Rembrandt's pupils; indeed, he was one of his most distinguished pupils. At the beginning of his career he faithfully followed his master - like Rembrandt he painted Biblical subjects, developed an intimate manner of expression and employed warm colouring - but later, disengaging himself from Rembrandt's entourage, he became popular with the citizens of Dordrecht as a painter of genre scenes and portraits. His portrayal became more elegant but at the same time more superficial, his use of lines harder, his colouring cooler.This picture is an early work which, when it was acquired for the Esterh�zy collection at the beginning of the nineteenth century, was ascribed to Rembrandt. It is an unusual example of Maes's work, partly because the subject has been taken from the New Testament - not the artist's usual practice. The two works which come closest to this picture are Christ Blessing Children in the National Gallery in London and Christ Mocked, once in St. Petersburg, and we know of no other works by the artist which show any relationship to this picture. There is no reliable evidence as to the circumstances in which it was painted, though, hypothetically, it might be the painting by Maes mentioned by seventeenth-century sources as being in collections in Amsterdam and Dordrecht.It is assumed that the boy at the left is the self-portrait of the young artist. The head of Pilate and that of the man with red beret are also portraits

32204-09deathg.jpg	The first important commission Poussin received was from Cardinal Francesco Barberini at the end of 1626, for the Death of Germanicus. The picture, now in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, was completed early in 1628 and immediately became famous. The subject was inspired by the 'Annals' of Tacit. This was the first of the deathbed scenes that Poussin was to favour throughout his life. The figures are arranged in a frieze-like composition which was almost certainly derived from the arrangement of figures on classical sarcophagi. Already, too, there is a preoccupation with classical antiquity and its intensely moral approach to life. In his pictures Poussin was to become obsessed by morality, and with man facing the supreme trial: how to face death with equanimity

34232-morrapla.jpg	The Morra Players was painted during Ricchi's time in Bergamo, and in any case after his return from France. His output at this moment was defined by figures presented in strong chiaroscuro that seem to stand out markedly from the background, at once influenced by French Caravaggism, which typically used candles as a source of light, and by the work of the Milanese painter Morazzone.The composition of the Morra Players and its emphatic use of chiaroscuro to describe profiles and salient points of physiognomy, finds a number of echoes in paintings from the artist's Bergamo period. One parallel lies in his choice of physical types: aged, humble figures are shown with very long fingers, highly prominent chins, and eyes half-absorbed by the penumbra, while the faces of the young people have more regular, almost suave features

22560-1dragon.jpg	Towards the end of his life, Filippino returned to Florence where he obtained a lucrative and challenging assignment, the Strozzi Chapel in Santa Maria Novella. The conditions in Florence were by then very different, because Leonardo had returned from Milan and Michelangelo, after a successful five-year stay in Rome, was also  in the city. Filippino rose to the occasion and produced his most engaging work in the fresco. Opting for large format scenes rather than the relatively constricting system that he faced in the Brancacci Chapel, for example, he filled the space with a nearly surrealistic collection of real and invented imagery.Even in their chronology, the dramatic frescoes in the Strozzi Chapel mark the end of an era. The balance and harmony upon which all of Florentine Humanism had been centred were now broken. The rhetorical gestures, the charged expressions, the unreal colours, but above all the ambiguity between architecture and figures, already belonged to a new age. The calm certainties of the 15th century were disappearing, giving way to the more troubled, questioning details common during the 16th century.The eccentric altar in the painting deserves a note to itself. At the foot of the altar steps crouches the dragon that the saint is exorcising. The composed and measured  perspectives that Tuscan painters preferred almost to the end of the 15th century, their regular architecture and classical rhythm are here abandoned in favour of an eclectic and deliberately confused rag-bag of architectural motifs. These are bizarrely interwoven in a way that breaks every rule. The overall effect is one of instability that also infects the groups of characters. There is a sense of unending clash between sculpture, reliefs, votive offerings, coloured statues, and lifelike details. We are seeing nothing less than the air of tension that followed the death of Lorenzo the Magnificent

00018-abbati1.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Alongside history paintings, the early period of the Macchiaioli notably included the Castiglioncello School of landscape art, of significance in the 1860s in particular. (The school was named after the Tuscan coastal town where the artists gathered to work.) The painters of this school, among them Giuseppe Abbati, Odoardo Borrani, and Giovanni Fattori, constituted a homogenous subgroup within the Macchiaioli. At first Abbati's art was to the fore, subsequently that of Fattori.Abbati was very taken with the clear, serene light of that part of the country, and with the colours, and he was the most regular of the visitors. A typical painting of the 1860s was his Landscape at Castiglioncello

30221-4ducale3.jpg	The present decoration of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Palazzo Ducale was realized after the disastrous fire of 1577 during which all the structures of the ship's-keel Gothic ceiling and the wall-paintings were destroyed. An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings. The canvases were dedicated, thematically, to the Glorification of Venice, in remembrance of the numerous military undertakings in the East or on the mainland by the Venetian ground troops. On the ceiling great importance was given to the victories of the Venetian army in conquering the mainland; along the wall to the dispute between Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa, who reached an agreement in Venice with the political mediation of Doge Sebastiano Ziani; and to the events of the Fourth Crusade, led by Doge Enrico Dandolo in the early years of the 13th century.Palma Giovane's Reconquest of Padua by Andrea Gritti is one of the thirty five panels on the ceiling of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio

19816-kaishei1.jpg	The picture shows the inner view of the wings of the Kaisheim Altarpiece.At the dawn of the sixteenth century the most important painter in Augsburg was Hans Holbein the Elder, active in the city as early as 1490 and throughout the first quarter of the new century, although he might have spent extended stays in Switzerland after 1516. Early in his career he produced altarpieces for the Dominican church in Frankfurt and the Cistercian monastery of Kaisheim, near Donauw�rth. His work in Kaisheim (completed 1502) consisted of painted organ wings as well as a high altar, the wings of which survive in Munich, although the central shrine is lost. The exterior wings display eight scenes  of the Passion, from the Agony in the Garden to the Resurrection, each of them framed by simulated coloured stone arches with leafy Gothic ornament. Even more decorative are the intricate, gilded ogive arches of the interior wings, which narrate the Life of the Virgin from her youth to her death, from nay scenes from the Gospels in between. The donor of the altarpiece, the Cistercian abbot Georg II Kastner, makes a cameo appearance kneeling beside his coat-of-arms in the Circumcision scene at the lower left.Holbein's Mary scenes from the altarpiece show his mastery of coordinating dignified groups of tall, slender figures within clearly defined but narrow and deep spaces

10772-adorati1.jpg	The enigmatic subject matter of this painting and its pendant Preaching of a Monk (Mus�e du Louvre, Paris) have left room for different interpretations of their significance. The use of skulls and crucifixes in the meditation represented evokes a form of devotion that grew in popularity during the Counter-Reformation and that was closely associated with the Capuchin branch of the Franciscan order. It was also proposed that the pendants are imaginary capricci involving monks, in which the artist gave free play to his imagination. Such paintings can be found in the oeuvre of the contemporary Venetian painter Alessandro Magnasco, and it is likely that Dandr�-Bardon drew on his knowledge of this artist's work to create his pendants.Formerly the painting was attributed to Jean-Honor� Fragonard

13083-abraham.jpg	The subject of this picture is taken from the Old testament (Gen. 18:1-19). While Abraham sat at the tent door in the middle of the day three men appeared before him. Realizing that they were angels he bowed down before them, fetched water and washed their feet; then with the traditional hospitality of the nomad he brought them food. The angels prophesied that a son would be born to Abraham's wife Sarah. But Sarah laughed at the idea because by now they were old and 'well stricken by age'. However she afterwards bore Isaac so the prophecy was fulfilled.In art, the three visitors are usually represented as angels with wings. Abraham's dwelling, contrary to the text, is a building rather than a tent. The angels were regarded as symbol of the Trinity and their prophecy was made a prefiguration of the Annunciation.

18379-1706grec.jpg	The two saints, who were strongly associated with each other as the most influential leaders of the early Church. In this portrayal they are shown engaged in an animated discussion. The older, white-haired Peter, wrapped  in a golden coloured cloak inclines his head thoughtfully to one side as he looks towards the text being expounded. In his left hand he holds his attribute, the key to the kingdom of Heaven. His right hand is cupped as if weighing up an idea. Paul presses his left hand down firmly on the open volume on the table, his right hand raised in a gesture of explanation as he looks directly at the viewer.St Peter and St Paul appear separately a great number of times in El Greco's oeuvre and they are depicted with remarkable consistency. Peter is always shown with white hair and beard, and he often wears his yellow cloak over a blue tunic. Paul is always shown slightly balding, with dark hair and beard, wearing a red mantle thrown over a blue or green tunic, which is here just visible at the neck.There is an earlier version of this composition in the Hermitage, St Petersburg.

25910-stillife.jpg	Judged the most talented student in the Spanish Royal Academy in 1745, Mel�ndez was expelled in 1748 as a result of a public dispute between the Academy and his father, also a painter. The expulsion prevented the artist from receiving commissions for altarpieces or large narrative pictures. In the last twenty years of his life he executed a hundred or so still lifes, for which he has now become famous. Although nearly half were first recorded in the Spanish royal residence at Aranjuez, they may not have been commissioned by the king directly from the painter, who died in poverty.This picture is one of a group of the artist's largest and finest works, perhaps made in connection with his second petition to the king to become court painter. Like most of Mel�ndez's still lifes, it focuses attention simultaneously on the geometrical forms of the homely and characteristically Spanish objects depicted - oranges, walnuts, a melon, wooden sweet boxes and barrel, terracotta jugs - and on their surface texture, and both shape and texture are revealed through the strong light falling from the upper left of the painting. The colours are restricted to black, white and a range of earth tones, relieved only by the brilliant orange. The spectator's viewpoint, so close to the picture surface, is located just above the smaller of the two jugs. Only the cracked walnuts allow us a glimpse of their edible flesh, among the unpeeled fruit and the sealed containers of sweetmeats, olives and oil, tantalisingly displayed humble products of Spanish soil and industry, ennobled by the artist's brush

25150-anthony1.jpg	In 1940, several panels, until then universally attributed to Sassetta, were reassigned by Longhi to another hand, today generally known as the Master of the Osservanza (active c. 1430-50). The most striking are scenes from the Life of St Anthony which were commissioned by the Augustinians. They held Anthony (251&#151;356) in special esteem as the founder of Christian monasticism, whose example converted St Augustine (Confessions, Book VIII).This panel depicts Anthony's second temptation on a rock-strewn path. The deep wilderness is uncanny, punctuated by fire-blasted trees and a sequence of still beasts &#151; a rabbit, two deer, another rabbit &#151; leading back to the sinister lake and the dark tower, surveyed by ominous crows. Anthony, now white-haired, throws up his hands in frozen horror. The focus of his gaze was originally a heap of diabolic riches, overpainted in a restoration.The theme of Anthony's tribulations has called forth some of the greatest images in European art - from Bosch's Lisbon Triptych and Gr�newald's Isenheim Altarpiece, to the 20th-century artists Ensor and Beckmann. Yet the Sienese images remain perhaps the most 'schizoid' and inward of them all

17015-nuenen35.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 163, JH 687.In December 1884 van Gogh set himself the task of painting and drawing a large series of portraits of the peasants in Brabant. In this group of works he did not want to portray individuals but sought to characterize a type: the peasant. Rather than seeking beauty, he was looking for models that had rough, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips. He regarded the series as preparation for multi-figure, large-scale compositions that he planned to paint afterwards.In the present painting the man depicted from the front appears against a dark background, his figure fills almost the whole canvas.

20732-educatio.jpg	The court painters Rubens and Van Dyck regarded art as an elevated intellectual activity and were firmly convinced that the creation of art was on a far loftier plane than any other manual work. Jordaens was rooted in a section of society bounded by more modest horizons. He devoted his life to furthering his personal prosperity, and considered that his material wealth and skill as an artist earned him the right to enjoy the status of a respected citizen. This somewhat bourgeois element is also reflected in his oeuvre, even in the mythological works such as The Education of Jupiter, in which the inhabitants of Olympus appear to be taken straight from everyday life, in spite of their nakedness.

35257-6madenth.jpg	The painting was executed for the parish church of Villamagna near Volterra. Compared to the complexity of the contemporary Deposition the compositional solution of this painting, signed and dated in the lower left corner, at the foot of St John the Baptist, is regulated by a simpler scheme and a greater symmetry, an evident recall to classical tradition. Andrea del Sarto's Madonna of the Harpies is one of the most probable iconographical references for Rosso's painting as far as the general structure is concerned, and in the pose of the Virgin, who, firmly anchored to a supporting base, extends her knee forward and places her right arm around the Child clutching at her side.

33444-08oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 501.The story of Samson, which had a great attraction for the Baroque public, is prominent in Rembrandt's production during the thirties. He painted Samson Threatening his Father-in-Law (1635, Staatliche Museen, Berlin) and the Marriage of Samson (1638, Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Dresden). His Blinding of Samson more than any other work shows Rembrandt's unrivalled use of the High Baroque style to appeal to his contemporaries' interest in the sensational. It is his most gruesome and violent work.The painting represents the bloody climax of the story. Samson has been overwhelmed by one of the Philistines, who has the biblical hero locked in his grip. Samson's right hand is being fettered by another soldier, and a third is plunging a sword into his eye, from which blood rushes forth. His whole frame writhes convulsively with sudden pain. The warrior standing in front, silhouetted against the light in the Honthorst manner, has his halberd ready to plunge into Samson if he manages to free himself before the hideous deed is done. Delilah, with a look of terror mixed with triumph, is a masterful characterization seen in a half haze, as she rushes to the opening of the tent.Here again the chiaroscuro adds an element of mystery and pictorial, as well as spiritual, excitement. The whole scale of light, from the deepest shadows to the intense bright light pouring into the tent, has gained in power and gradations over the works of the Leiden period. The scene could not have been represented with more dreadful accents, and Rembrandt may have finished it with the triumphant feeling of having surpassed Rubens's dramatic effects, for this picture was also inspired by a work of the Flemish master: The Capture of Samson (now in Munich).This large painting originally was even larger. Several copies are also known.

26159-0149burg.jpg	An almost equally large version of this portrait is in the Mus�e Cond�, Chantilly. The man is depicted shoulder-length against a plain dark green background, behind a stone sill, on which his right hand rests. The chain of the Order of the Golden Fleece hangs around his neck. The identification is based on the motto and on older copies bearing the name of the subject.Probably born in about 1430, Anthony of Burgundy was a bastard son of Philip the Good and Jeanne de Presles. He was knighted in 1452 and admitted to the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1456. Both portraits are clearly based on a single prototype, whose style and conception indicate that it must have been painted by Memling. Although other opinions existed in the past, there is now a broad consensus to this effect. The Chantilly version features powerful and contrasting modelling and might have been produced before the end of the fifteenth century. The Dresden copy is weaker and might not have been executed until some time in the sixteenth century. The reverse is also fairly heavily damaged. Nevertheless, it shows the same inscriptions. It is usually the Chantilly version, therefore, which is referred to when seeking to evoke the original. In view of the costume and age of the subject, the original work must have been painted in around 1467-70, and will thus have belonged to Memling's earliest known portraits

14262-7nativi.jpg	The Nativity with two angels, Sts Bernard and Thomas of Aquino is the only signed work of the Sienese master. (It is signed 'Francisc. Georgii insit' at left bottom.)Francesco di Giorgio's interpretation of the Nativity is more closely related to depictions of the Adoration of the Child by the Virgin. Unlike those by Leonardo, Filippino Lippi, and Botticelli, this interpretation includes two saints on the left, in addition to the Holy Family accompanied by two angels. The event is set in an open landscape, with a particularly elaborate distant view in the upper left background of this lunette shaped panel. Behind the angels, a very simplified shed constructed out of a handful of wooden beams extends from an outcropping of rock.In the short time between the Coronation and the Nativity, more properly an Adoration of the Child, commissioned in 1475 and presumably finished a year later, we see a shift that may signal a new phase in Francesco's development. But the number of paintings that can be attributed to him is so small that his evolution as a painter is virtually impossible to define. The Nativity is a more confident and less crowded composition than the Coronation. The radically twisted St Joseph in the centre, with his active movement, is an ambitious restatement of the Christ from the earlier picture. The sacred figures, including St Bernard and St Thomas (not Sts Bernardine and Ambrose, as their embossed inscriptions added in the nineteenth century would have it) with Joseph and Mary, form a flattened arc in space around an alert, open-eyed Child who rests His head on a pillow, which is formally related to the picture plane.Francesco's treatment of the drapery gives the impression of having been based on careful studies, particularly noticeable in the figure of St Bernard. The figures, all on the same plane, are preceded by a bit of bare terrain. Directly behind the manger, a simple lean-to is attached to an outcropping of rock, with a segment of a classical building in a decaying state. Still farther in the distance is a well-articulated landscape with a local Sienese flavour. The two angels standing casually on the right are tall, weightless images enrapt in their own dreams.

35263-1moses.jpg	Among Rosso's paintings concerned with the representation of themes belonging to the religious iconographical tradition, this painting is a very special case, not least due to the rarity of the subject. The title of the painting refers to an episode of Moses's youth narrated in the book of Exodus (II, 16-22). The seven daughters of Jethro, priest of the land of Midian, while drawing water from a well and filling troughs to water their father's flock, are troubled by a group of Midianite shepherds who take advantage of the labours of the young women to water their own herds. Moses, sitting near the well, witnesses the scene; driving the Midianites away with threats he intervenes physically in defence of Jethro's daughters who thanks to his help can finally water their flocks. In recognition of the meritorious action performed by the young Moses, Jethro gives him the hand of one of his daughters, Zipporah.There are unequivocal references in the painting to the two cartoons made by Michelangelo and Leonardo for the decoration of the Great Council Hall in Palazzo della Signoria. Rosso's canvas reproposes the extremely articulated compositional structure of Michelangelo's Battle of Cascina, displaying a broad range of nude figure poses which reflect the artist's predilection for counterpoise. The emphasizing of gestures and clothing, and the impassioned savagery of the actions and expressions, on the other hand, are associated with Leonardo's Battle of Anghiari.

18392-1805grec.jpg	St Philip was from Bethsaida and was one of the first to be called to follow Christ. He was said to have journeyed to Scythia preaching the gospel. In the city of Hierapolis he succeeded, with the aid of the cross, in banishing a serpent or dragon which was the object of worship in the temple of Mars. As the monster emerged it gave off such a stink that many people died. The enraged priests of the temple captured Philip and crucified him. According to a tradition in the eastern Church Philip was crucified upside down like Peter.His place in art is not prominent and devotional figures and scenes from his life are fairly rare. He is represented as a man in middle years, usually with a short beard. His attribute is the cross. In this representation by El Greco St Philip turns towards the cross on which he was believed to have been martyred; the short arm of the cross appears at the top of the picture

41370-05castle.jpg	During restoration work in 1979-80 in the Sala del Mappamondo of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, a new fresco was discovered below the imposing Guidoriccio da Fogliano by Simone Martini, representing a castle on a hill and two people in the foreground. The attempt to discover the identity of the unknown author of this work has given rise to much controversy among critics. Duccio, Pietro Lorenzetti, Memmo di Filippuccio, Simone Martini were suggested. The fresco, of outstanding executive quality both in skilful choice of descriptive detail and in its overall coherence, was badly damaged by the Mappamondo, a large, revolving, circular painting by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which was placed on top of it in 1345

40124-studiolo.jpg	The painting shows one of the panels on the walls of the Studiolo of Francesco I de' Medici.The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments. Two doors, not distinguished in any way from the cupboard doors, cover the only windows: Francesco preferred to work by candlelight.The intimate scale of the project allowed Vasari and his pupils to develop their imaginative abilities, technical skill, and jewel-like delicacy of colour. Eight sculptors made the bronze statuettes, and the paintings were by twenty-four artists including Bartolomeo Traballesi. This precious chamber is the only sixteenth-century room in Europe to survive with its oil paintings intact

14438-205fried.jpg	Visions of Gothic architecture appear regularly in the artist's work from Winter Landscape with Church (1811, Dortmund), rising like a man-made enigma in a mysterious landscape scenario. An example is provided by The Cross in the Mountains, which can be dated fairly confidently to 1812, and which has long been viewed as a further development of the Tetschen Altar. The rough and rocky terrain of the foreground surrounds a spring, behind which, within an indeterminate space, rise a dark wall of fir trees and the gabled fa�ade of a Gothic church, reduced to a shadowy silhouette. A wayside calvary marks the border between foreground and back- ground. The logic of space and time seems to have been abandoned in this painting in favour of the unreality of a dream

11617-diana.jpg	The story of how this festive picture came to be painted is very unusual. Cardinal Aldobrandini commissioned it as a sequel to Titian's Bacchanals which he had recently added to his collection. The comparison with such an illustrious model brought out the best in Domenichino, especially his ability to handle light, and spurred him to take a fresh approach. Unlike Titian, the Emilian painter was willing to avoid explosive use of colour and movement. Instead he seemed content to concentrate on a serene contemplation of the beauty of girls, animals, and the countryside.In his Diana Domenichino revived antique themes and the depiction of nymphs. The subject derives from Virgil's Aeneid (V, 485) where warriors are described competing in an archery contest and shooting a tree with their first arrow, a ribbon with their second and a falling bird with their third. It was probably Mons. Giovanni Battista Agucchi, major theorist and adviser on iconography at the time, who suggested transposing the subject matter into the realm of the nymphs led by Diana. The archery theme was adopted as a metaphor for shrewd arguments that hit the mark, which was topical at the time, as the dedication of the 'Dicerie sacre' by the poet Giovan Battista Marino to Pope Paul V indicates.In capturing nature in clear compositions that predominate over the use of colour, Domenichino nonetheless adopts Venetian tones now and then in the flowing draperies, and there are extraordinary passages from green to yellow, white to blue and various shades of purple. But what opens up a new chapter in the rendering of atmosphere are his gradual and calculated changes in tone towards the pale blue mountains by using increasingly subtle glazings, which indicate a new interest in Leonardo's theories on aerial perspective (studied and taught by the Theatine monk Matteo Zacc&#242;lini, who taught Domenichino perspective in the 1620s)

20021-deadbird.jpg	In the seventeenth century, wealthy Dutch burghers could show their status by displaying hunting equipment in their hussies, or by having themselves portrayed in hunting gear. Another possibility was to display still-lifes showing the spoils of the hunt.

26722-lu11ies.jpg	"""Obed begat Jesse. Jesse begat King David. King David begat Solomon by the wife Uria. Solomon begat Rehoboam."" (Matthew 1:5-7)The lunette is between the Libyan Sibyl and Daniel.Traditionally it is believed that David is the principal figure on the left, while Solomon is the child with a veiled head behind him who holds out what may be a ritual offering on a small tray; Bathsheba is the woman on the right. If this is correct, then Jesse must be the child depicted, together with his parents, in the spandrel above.David's pose - his head and torso are seen frontally, his pelvis and legs are turned slightly to the left - stresses his physical strength and his awesome sense of dominion, and this is accentuated by the contrast with the minute figure of his son and the thin, bent one of the woman.He is wearing clothes in Oriental style: a green cap-cum-hood hanging down over his shoulders, resembles the Arab kaffiyeh; the upper part of his robe is rose, the lower part yellow. His arms are folded across his chest and, with his left hand, he holds the edge of a white cloth, possibly also having a ritual function, spread over his knees. His hand, modeled with remarkable energy, and the folds of the lower part of the robe, emerge forcefully in the foreground. David's face, partly in shadow under his headdress, expresses great concentration, though he seems to have suddenly noticed something on his left. More severe tones are used for the clothes of the woman, who, absorbed by her work on a wool-winder, is sitting sideways on and wearing a violet dress, girt above the waist by a green sash, over a white shirt with gray-blue shadows. Her headgear is also grayish, while the only bright touches are provided by the yellow ocher cloth covering the seat, and the red boots visible in the shadow at the bottom"

21275-moses.jpg	The two paintings, Eliezer and Rebecca by Antoine Coypel and the Finding of Moses by Charles de La Fosse, were commissioned in 1701 for the Cabinet du Billard at Versailles. They reveal the profound changes taking place in French painting at the beginning of the 18th century.After the reorganization of the Paris Academy in 1661 by Louis XIV (whose aim was to control all the artistic activity in France) a controversy occurred among the members that was to dominate artistic attitudes for the rest of the century. This was what has been described as the 'battle of styles', the conflict over whether Rubens or Poussin was a suitable model to follow. Poussin's art from his mature period  was an ideal model for an academic teacher because his pictures followed such a precise sequence of rules in the placing of figures and in facial expressions. OPn the other hand, the sensuality of Rubens, both in form and colour, was an ideal model to imitate when painting on a grand scale was required, especially for a palace decoration. The sides were never reconciled in theory: the views of the Rubenists and the Poussinists were too opposed; but a surprising number of painters combined the characteristics of both sources, to produce a hybrid art that set the standard for the rest of the century.One of the earliest and best of the painters involved in the battle of styles was Charles de La Fosse whose style already looks forward to the 18th century. La Fosse's colour is Rubensian, but his compositions are classically inspired. Few painters of the time had La Fosse's energy, and his most important achievement was the decoration of the interior of the dome of Les Invalides in Paris toward the end of his career in the 1690s.The Finding of Moses is remarkable for its use of light and fresh colour sense.

04745-landscap.jpg	Bloemaert lived to the age of almost ninety. He was a contemporary of Rembrandt and yet he belonged to the generation of Rembrandt's teachers. He was the leading representative of the Utrecht Mannerists and the director and founder of the Utrecht Guild of St Luke, but he continued to work well into the Baroque I7th century when a third generation of landscape painters was already emerging.His peasant landscape contains certain Mannerist elements such as the large distance between the foreground objects and the sweeping horizon, or in the way in which he has united contrasts. The aspects of Bloemaert's work adopted by Dutch landscape painters are the picturesque elements evident in his rendering of nature and architecture. The picturesque appeal of dilapidated cottages, damaged thatching, broken fences and rotten tree trunks were to become part and parcel of Netherlandish landscape painting.Bloemaert's oeuvre also forges a link between Flemish and Dutch painting. While his portrayals of mythological themes and biblical tales lean heavily on the syntax of the international Flemish Mannerists, the dramatic realism of his rural genre paintings influenced the Dutch artists.

04006-golden.jpg	The Castello di Torrechiara (Emilia-Romagna) is one of the most beautiful examples of feudal, secular architecture from the fifteenth century in northern Italy. It was erected between 1448 and 1460 on the ruins of an earlier fort. The castle is most famous for the poetic love story that was played out here and is immortalized in the paintings in its Sala d'Oro (Golden Room).The Golden Room is one of the few secular rooms dating from the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance still preserved relatively intact. The subject matter of its paintings is based on an actual love affair, that of Pier Maria Rossi and Bianca Pellegrini.Pier Maria Rossi (1413-1482) was  one of the most powerful feudal lords in the region of Parma. Although he was highly experienced in warfare, he received a humanistic education and had a certain gift for poetry. He had an imposing number of castles, but he was unable to defend his domain against the ruler  of Milan, Ludovico il Moro in 1480. He died in 1482 in Torrechiara.Bianca Pellegrini was the mistress of Rossi who spent most of his time with Bianca in Torrechiara. Bianca appears to have died a few years before her lover and was buried, like him, in the chapel at Torrechiara.The walls of the Golden Room are covered, up to a height of roughly 3 m to the springing of the vaulting ribs, with terracotta tiles. The pictorial program of the Golden Room is a monument to a love affair. The four encounters between Bianca Pellegrini and her lover depicted in the lunettes represent four different stages in their relationship.The first picture in the sequence is the one of Amor shooting arrows on the southeast wall. Pier Maria Rossi has been shot in the breast, and clasps the arrow with both hands. Again drawing his bow, Amor has turned toward Bianca, and in fact she too has been struck with an arrow, but does not appear to notice it.The second scene, on the southwest fireplace wall, shows Bianca handing a sword to Pier Maria who kneels before her. As a proper knight, he has vowed to be her protector, and clearly she has accepted him.The third scene, on the northwest wall, again shows the couple inside a shrinelike aedicula. Again he kneels before her, but this time she is placing a laurel wreath on his head, crowning him as a poet.In the fourth and last scene, on the northeast wall, the two lovers are seen for the first time from the front, standing in the side niches of a structure reminiscent of a triptych. The two castles in the background of the scene allude to the couple's actual situation: on the left is San Secondo, the chief residence of Pier Maria Rossi, and on the right is Roccabianca, the castle he built for Bianca Pellegrini.The paintings in the four compartments of the cross-ribbed vaulting supplement the subject matter of the walls but are subordinate to it. Here we see Bianca Pellegrini's progress through the realm of her beloved.The paintings in the Golden Room are attributed to Benedetto Bembo. However, due to the similarities in style between Benedetto and his brother Bonifazio Bembo, the possible authorship of the latter cannot be excluded

29369-2south1.jpg	At the north end of the transept of Santa Maria Novella two brothers who were heads of a very large and active workshop, Andrea di Cione (known as Orcagna) and Nardo di Cione provided the altarpiece and frescoes for the Strozzi Chapel, one of the most important decorative programs of the time.Dominican commitment to orthodoxy, order, and the institutional church is evident on the left wall of the chapel where a Paradise shows the elect arranged row upon row, around and beneath the figures of the enthroned Divinity and the Virgin. Both figures are crowned; the figure of God even holds a sceptre.

05500-korah.jpg	"The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Moses in the Sistine Chapel. It is located in the fifth compartment on the south wall.The message of this painting provides the key to an understanding of the Sistine Chapel as a whole before Michelangelo's work. The fresco, located in the fifth compartment on the south wall, reproduces three episodes, each of which depicts a rebellion by the Hebrews against God's appointed leaders, Moses and Aaron, along with the ensuing divine punishment of the agitators. On the right-hand side, the revolt of the Jews against Moses is related, the latter portrayed as an old man with a long white beard, clothed in a yellow robe and an olive-green cloak. Irritated by the various trials through which their emigration from Egypt was putting them, the Jews demanded that Moses be dismissed. They wanted a new leader, one who would take them back to Egypt, and they threatened to stone Moses; however, Joshua placed himself protectively between them and their would-be victim, as depicted in Botticelli's painting.The centre of the fresco shows the rebellion, under the leadership of Korah, of the sons of Aaron and some Levites, who, setting themselves up in defiance of Aaron's authority as high priest, also offered up incense. In the background we see Aaron in a blue robe, swinging his incense censer with an upright posture and filled with solemn dignity, while his rivals stagger and fall to the ground with their censers at God's behest. Their punishment ensues on the left-hand side of the picture, as the rebels are swallowed up by the earth, which is breaking open under them. The two innocent sons of Korah, the ringleader of the rebels, appear floating on a cloud, exempted from the divine punishment.The principal message of these scenes is made manifest by the inscription in the central field of the triumphal arch: ""Let no man take the honour to himself except he that is called by God, as Aaron was."" The fresco thus holds a warning that God's punishment will fall upon those who oppose God's appointed leaders. This warning also contained a contemporary political reference through the portrayal of Aaron in the fresco, depicted wearing the triple-ringed tiara of the Pope and thus characterized as the papal predecessor. It was a warning to those questioning the ultimate authority of the Pope over the Church. The papal claims to leadership were God-given, their origin lay in Christ giving Peter the keys to the kingdom of heaven and thereby granting him privacy over the young Church. Perugino painted this crucial element of the doctrine of papal supremacy immediately opposite Botticelli's fresco"

33403-04passio.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 561.Rembrandt received a commission from the court in about 1628 through Constantijn Huygens, secretary to the Prince of Orange, for five paintings of the Passion of Christ. The series started with the Raising of the Cross and Descent from the Cross. He was hired to create small versions of Rubens famous altarpieces in Antwerp, the Raising of the Cross and the Descent from the Cross. Huygens asked Rembrandt to produce paintings less than one-twenty-fifth the size of the Rubenses. It must also have been agreed between Huygens and Rembrandt that the artist would inset himself into the composition of the Descent from the Cross as one of the followers of Christ who eased the body to the ground.The two paintings, finished in 1633 are plainly modelled on Rubens's versions of those subjects. When they were delivered in 1633, a new commission followed, for three more paintings of scenes from the Passion of Christ, The Entombment, The Resurrection and The Ascension. The first to be delivered, early in 1636, was The Ascension, the last in iconographic order. If in the Raising and Descent Rembrandt had vied with Rubens, in the Ascension he had moved back in time to the Venetian master Titian. In a composition based on one of Titian's most famous works, the Assumption of the Virgin in the Church of Frari in Venice, Rembrandt created an image of earth, sky, and heaven, with mortals taking leave of a divine creature being raised by angels to the Godhead itself.The reception of the Ascension was not enthusiastic and did not lead to new commissions from The Hague. The final two pieces from the commission of 1633, The Entombment and The Resurrection, were completed in 1639. The series was finally completed only in 1646, with a commission for two other canvases with scenes from the life of Christ as an infant, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Circumcision (now lost, it is known from a copy in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig)

08283-warrior.jpg	A sense of calm and expressiveness as well as light effects are outstanding in this canvas, with the beautiful helmet and pieces of armour on foreground. This painting was for long identified erroneously as the portrait of Gattamelata.

The middle register of a depiction of the Last Judgment on the west wall of the basilica, fragments of the fresco of the Annunciation on the north wall, and two scenes from the story of Jacob on the south wall were uncovered. It is assumed that there were cycles of the Old and New Testament, respectively, on facing walls of the nave.The fragment of Esau Appears to Isaac is on the south wall of the nave. It is probable that Cavallini was influenced by the Isaac frescoes in the Upper Church of San Francesco in Assisi. The posture of Isaac in bed; drawing back as he recognizes the deceit, raising his left hand in horror, the architecture of the bed-chamber - all correspond closely to motifs found in the Assisi fresco, though the artistic realization is clearly of lesser quality

She did much to speed the Compromise of 1867 which gave some autonomy to Hungary, and her efforts to this end won her the epithet of ""The Good Hungarian Queen"".

According to the inventory of 1499 which lists the property of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco, the painting Pallas and the Centaur hung above a door in the same room as the Primavera. Its bare landscape focuses one's gaze on the two figures. A centaur has trespassed on forbidden territory. This lusty being, half horse and half man, is being brought under control by a guard armed with a shield and halberd, and she has grabbed him by the hair. The woman has been identified both as the goddess Pallas Athena and the Amazon Camilla, chaste heroine of Virgil's Aeneid. What is undisputed is the moral content of the painting, in which virtue is victorious over sensuality.This painting marks the end of Botticelli's Medicean period, from this point onwards the subject-matter of his paintings changes and becomes increasingly religious

41472-offerin.jpg	This picture shows one of the small panels that served as book covers for the semiannual ledgers of the Biccherna and Gabella, the financial and fiscal offices of the commune of Siena. The tradition of binding the ledger volumes with painted wood panels was instituted in 1257 and the oldest preserved panel covers the accounts of the second semester of 1258. The Archivio di Stato in Siena has a collection of over a hundred of these panels.The present tablet originating from the Biccherna (revenue office) depicts the offering of the city keys of Siena to the Virgin Mary in the Cathedral. It shows the Cathedral interior where part of Duccio's Maest&#224; is visible, painted as described in the inventory; above, on the left, the round window designed by Duccio can also be seen.The earliest covers usually show the camerlengo (the chief financial officer of the Republic), often a monk from the Cistercian abbey of San Galgano, as he writes in his account book, counts or disburses money, or supervises a clerk. The covers always display the coats of arms of at least four leading citizens who served as provveditori charged with overseeing the financial proceedings. The names of all these officers are prominently mentioned on the lower half of the panels, thus vouching for the accuracy of the accounts. While most of the panels of the 13th and 14th centuries are anonymous, we find among the later panels attributions to Paolo di Giovanni Fei, Giovanni di Paolo, Sano di Pietro, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and Benvenuto di Giovanni. The present panel is attributed to Pietro di Francesco degli Orioli. Some 15th century panels record important events of Sienese history, such as the coronation of Pius II on a biccherna of 1460, or the Virgin protecting Siena from an earthquake on the biccherna of 1467

05517-10primav.jpg	"In 1550, Vasari wrote that a picture which according to him announced the arrival of spring was in the Medici villa in Castello. In 1477, the estate was acquired by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, who was a second cousin of Lorenzo the Magnificent. This is why it was long assumed that the Primavera (Spring), as the painting continues to be called, was painted for the fourteen year old Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco when the villa was bought. An inventory dating from 1499, which was not discovered until 1975, lists the property of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and his brother Giovanni and states that in the 15th century the Primavera had been displayed in Florence's city palace. The painting decorated an anteroom attached to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's chambers.Such large format paintings were nothing new in high-ranking private residences. The Primavera is, however, special in that it is one of the first surviving paintings from the post-classical period which depicts classical gods almost naked and life-size. Some of the figures are based on ancient sculptures. These are, however, not direct copies but are translated into Botticelli's own unconventional formal language: slender figures whose bodies at times seem slightly too long. Above all it is the women's domed stomachs that demonstrate the contemporary ideal of beauty.Venus is standing in the centre of the picture, set slightly back from the other figures. Above her, Cupid is aiming one of his arrows of love at the Three Graces, who are elegantly dancing a roundel. The garden of the goddess of love is guarded by Mercury on the left. Mercury, who is lightly clad in a red cloak covered with flames, is wearing a helmet and carrying a sword, clearly characterizing him as the guardian of the garden. The messenger of the gods is also identified by means of his winged shoes and the caduceus staff which he used to drive two snakes apart and make peace; Botticelli has depicted the snakes as winged dragons. From the right, Zephyr, the god of the winds, is forcefully pushing his way in, in pursuit of the nymph Chloris. Next to her walks Flora, the goddess of spring, who is scattering flowers.Various interpretations of the scene exist. Leaving aside the suppositions there remains the profoundly humanistic nature of the painting, a reflection of contemporary cultural influences and an expression of many contemporary texts.One source for this scene is Ovid's Fasti, a poetic calendar describing Roman festivals. For the month of May, Flora tells how she was once the nymph Chloris, and breathes out flowers as she does so. Aroused to a fiery passion by her beauty, Zephyr, the god of the wind, follows her and forcefully takes her as his wife. Regretting his violence, he transforms her into Flora, his gift gives her a beautiful garden in which eternal spring reigns. Botticelli is depicting two separate moments in Ovid's narrative, the erotic pursuit of Chloris by Zephyr and her subsequent transformation into Flora. This is why the clothes of the two women, who also do not appear to notice each other, are being blown in different directions. Flora is standing next to Venus and scattering roses, the flowers of the goddess of love. In his philosophical didactic poem, De Rerum Nature the classical writer Lucretius celebrated both goddesses in a single spring scene. As the passage also contains other figures in Botticelli's group, it is probably one of the main sources for the painting: ""Spring-time and Venus come,/ And Venus' boy, the winged harbinger, steps on before,/ And hard on Zephyr's foot-prints Mother Flora,/ Sprinkling the ways before them, filleth all/ With colours and with odours excellent."""

44790-stfranci.jpg	Zurbar�n produced devotional works relating to the founder of the Franciscan Order throughout his career, and through their stark simplicity and profound sense of spirituality, they can today be considered amongst the most evocative and iconic sacred images produced within 17th-century Spain.In its simplicity and directness, Zurbar�n's depiction of St Francis is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, following the Council of Trent (1545-63), which encouraged a new focus on devotional life and re-affirmed the importance of the veneration of images			
19544-bullhunt.jpg	Joseph Heintz the Younger, from Augsburg, earned himself a reputation for paintings illustrating the characteristic Venetian festivals but left us only a few canvases that capture the city convincingly. Most of his paintings show an urban environment built up from coulisses, and take little heed of the laws of perspective. Heintz's compositions are dotted with numerous small, rather spindly figures, under the apparent influence of Jacques Callot. Most of these routine townscapes are based not on personal observation &#151; though Heintz spent most of his life in Venice &#151; but on older prints and paintings. Heintz's compositions served in turn as models for a large number of paintings of mediocre to very mediocre quality, Venetian festivals again being the preferred subject.

16817-1troia1.jpg	As work was coming to an end at the Palazzo del T�, Giulio Romano increased the number of new projects in various places and varying degrees of importance. One of his most significant projects in this period, though, was the decoration of Federico Gonzaga's official apartment in the Palazzo Ducale, Mantua, later called the Appartamento di Troia (Troy Apartment) after its most important room, the Sala di Troia. It was begun in 1536 and completed around 1540.The scenes painted on the ceiling and walls of the Sala di Troia narrate the Greek victory over the Trojans as it is recounted in The Iliad. The battle itself rages across the ceiling: desperate horses and warriors lie on their backs while victorious heroes stand over them. The scene is painted as a continuum interrupted only by trees painted to conceal the angular corners of the room. The paintings on the walls narrate individual stories from the war, and they are isolated in giant fictive frames. These scenes, painted by Giulio's students, include the construction of the Trojan Horse, Laoco�n and His Sons Attacked by Serpents, Hecuba's Dream, and the Death of Ajax.The room was originally decorated all the way down to the floor pavement with military trophies and faux marble, and as a whole it alludes to the military virtues of Federico Gonzaga

15565-7herod.jpg	"The cycle of the life of St John concludes in the large tympanum with Herod's Banquet, about which Vasari wrote that: ""The last scene, the one in the arch next to the vaulting, presents the sumptuous Banquet of Herod and the Dance of Herodias, along with countless servants performing various chores in the scene ; the picture also contains a large building drawn in perspective which, together with the painted figures, clearly reveals Domenico's skill.""A colossal palace architecture, carefully constructed according to the laws of perspective, rises up in the form of a series of enormous barrel and dome vaults, which in the foreground are supported by columns. Ghirlandaio was familiar with these columns with entablature blocks from Brunelleschi's Florentine churches of Santo Spirito and San Lorenzo, while the complex overall design of the building is reminiscent of the Maxentius Basilica in Rome. That classical building had been built by the Roman emperors Maxentius and Constantine as a monumental hall building with three aisles; the long central aisle was roofed by three huge groin vaults and the side aisles by coffered vaults.In contrast to his more restrained depiction of Mary's death, here Ghirlandaio uses his powers to the full, both in the extravagant architecture and the vivid, though still somewhat stiff, figure of the dancing Salome. Ghirlandaio adopted and varied this dancing figure, together with the entire composition of the scene, from Filippo Lippi's depiction of the same scene in Prato Cathedral, painted between 1452 and 1466. That earlier painting already contains the musicians on the left, the row of pots on the right and the view out onto a landscape in the center. The arrangement of the figures was altered, but scarcely improved, by Ghirlandaio. Above all, and in the face of the festive and yet gruesome events, the figures lack all sense of drama. They display neither a lively party mood nor signs of horror or repulsion. The arrangement of the banqueters around the three long laid tables is reminiscent of Ghirlandaio's earlier depictions of the Last Supper. Here too, in addition to wine glasses and bowls, red cherries are arranged on the white table cloth."

14165-021love.jpg	Fragonard repeated the compositions of the two small pendants known as Love as Folly, and Love the Sentinel numerous times during his career, two pairs are in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. The various versions of the compositions are usually dated to the early 1770s on the basis of style. Their light colour scheme, rapid brushwork, and lighthearted subjects are similar to numerous paintings, often in oval format, that Fragonard produced in the years around 1770. During this period he was at work on his most celebrated cycle of decorative paintings, the large canvases called the Progress of Love, painted around 1771-72 at the request of Madame du Barry for her pleasure pavilion at Louveciennes outside Paris and now in the Frick Collection, New York.

08282-ursula.jpg	Bartolomeo Cavarozzi's altarpiece, dated 1608, was commissioned by the Confraternit&#224; delle Sante Orsola e Caterina. That same year the confraternity had begun holding services at its newly renovated church, Sant'Orsola a Ripetta, near the Piazza del Popolo. Shortly after 1661, the society moved to San Nicola de' Funari a Tor de' Specchi, which, following building work, was reconsecrated to SS. Ursula and Catherine of Alexandria. Until the mid-eighteenth century, Cavarozzi's painting probably hung not over the high altar, but above the altar at the left. The entire neighbourhood, including the church, was destroyed between 1928 and 1936 and at that time the painting was transferred to the sacristy of San Marco.Like Pomarancio's St Domitilla with SS. Nereus and Achilleus (Chiesa dei Santi Nereo e Achilleo, Rome), Cavarozzi based his work on Raphael's St Cecilia altarpiece in Bologna, which he probably knew from an engraving. This is especially apparent in the figure of St Catherine of Alexandria, who raises one leg and holds her hand to her breast as she gazes upwards at the triangle containing the all-seeing eye of God. Pope Ciriacus, too, looks heavenwards. Behind St Ursula are a number of her one thousand followers. In contrast to Pomarancio's St Domitilla, Cavarozzi's St Ursula looks towards the viewer with an outstretched arm, presenting the Banner of the Cross.The hand with the banner is modelled on the work of Michelangelo and has its roots in his Creation of Adam in the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo himself used the gesture again in his Risen Christ in Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. The gesture is not only a call to imitate Christ and take up the cross, but also implies that only by doing so can one attain eternal life. Caravaggio, too, cited this gesture in his Calling of St Matthew in San Luigi dei Francesi. With outstretched hand and bent forefinger, Christ beckons Matthew to follow him. St Ursula's gesture has the same implication: only those willing to champion the cause of Christ and take up the Banner of the Cross in his defence can hope for salvation. Once again, Cavarozzi created a highly functional painting by adopting well-known gestures and poses, which helped viewers - in this case the members of the confraternity - to understand its meaning easily

28796-remember.jpg	In his later career, Morbelli concentrated on subjects of labour and life of the poor, frequently depicting the old people at the Pio Albergo Trivulzio, a retirement home in Milan founded in 1771 that housed more than eight hundred men and women by 1900. In order to carry out his work with the greatest possible authenticity, the artist obtained a room of his own there.

07454-03boy.jpg	One of the sure signs of an early painting by Caravaggio is the patent influence of northern Italian art. The boy with a fruit basket has analogies with a Fruit Seller by the Lombard painter Vincenzo Campi, painted about 1580, but Caravaggio is not content to follow the traditions on which he draws. Instead of the young women favoured by his predecessors, he has chosen a teenage boy; and he has brought his subject almost to the front of the picture plane, so that the boy seems to offer himself as well as the fruit to the spectator's gaze. There is a sign of uncertainty in the awkward way that the boy's long thick neck rises out of his shoulder blades, yet there is compensation in the poetic device which places his weary eyes partially in the shade.Once again Caravaggio has used the diagonal 'cellar' light which was to become a hallmark of his style. Against a near-blank ground, attention is focused on the right side of the boy's upper body, the classical drapery on his right arm and the marvellously realized fruit, displaying succulent peaches and bunches of grapes

09640-flowers3.jpg	Gabriel de la Corte was one of the principal flower painters working in Madrid during the second half of the 17th century. His technique is markedly different from that of his contemporary Bartolom� P�rez and the older Juan de Arellano, for rather than adhering to the tradition of the great Flemish still-life painters in their precision of detail, his brushwork is at once more spirited and schematic..Unlike Juan de Arellano and Bartolom� P�rez, De la Corte did not enjoy royal patronage at the court and as a result had to make a living selling his works in the shops of Madrid. According to Palomino he contributed the flower garlands to the work of artists such as Antonio Castrej�n and Mat�as de Torres and a large body of his known oeuvre consists of floral and architectural decoration, probably painted to adorn the grand houses of Madrid (which out of context today perhaps no longer retain their original impact and effect)

Poverty glances back sweetly toward her bridegroom. The curves of the Virtues harmonize with the shapes of the cusped frame.

23852-3manet11.jpg	The Argenteuil (of vertical format) and the Boating (of horizontal format) are two open air genre portraits - rather than landscapes - which Manet painted in August 1874 at Argenteuil. The vertical-format painting is structurally the tighter thanks to its linear components, and is also the richest in motifs and forms. The sketchy horizontal-format picture uses large spaces of glowing colour.  We do not know who the women in these paintings are; the man was either Manet's brother-in-law, the Dutch painter Rodolphe Leenhoff, or Baron Barbier.This painting, sent to the 1874 Salon, was a radical transformation in Manet's painting. This was no longer a work invented in the studio on the model of a famous museum piece. It was, on the contrary, proof positive that Manet had joined the Monet-school

11263-110delac.jpg	There is a manifest sensuality to this dreaming woman with her body offered up to the spectator's gaze, and we know from the Journal that Delacroix's relations with his models often went beyond the pictorial; but there are also traces of the influence of Bonington in the presentation, and perhaps of Delacroix's desire to emulate Ingres' nudes			
11635-sibyl2.jpg	This painting is considered part of a group of Sibyls that Domenichino executed with the same general composition starting in the mid-1610s.

Every last detail of the picture is handled with impeccable care which was, indeed, typical of Domenichino. The Emilian painter was openly inspired by Raphael's work, and in particular his St Cecilia in Bologna, but rephrased in a manner suitable for a pagan prophetess rather than a Christian saint, with gold-decorated turban, splendid wrap, and gilded chair

35588-06fourme.jpg	"In 1630 Rubens returned to Antwerp from his diplomatic mission in England. His two sons were now twelve and sixteen, and he himself was over fifty. Yet the young woman he was now to marry, Helene Fourment, was no older than his elder son. She was, in the words of the Cardinal-Infante Fernando, ""the most beautiful woman in Antwerp"". She was the younger daughter of the silk and tapestry-merchant, Daniel Fourment, and sister to the Suzanne Fourment whose delightful portrait Rubens had painted some years before. Rubens explained himself to Peiresc: ""I decided to remarry, for I have never been attracted to the abstinent life of the celibate, and I told myself that, though we should award the crown to continence, we may nevertheless enjoy legitimate pleasures and give thanks for them. I have chosen a young woman of good but bourgeois family, though everyone sought to convince me to make a court marriage. But I was fearful of a vice inbred in the nobility, and especially prevalent among noble women: vanity. So I chose someone who would never have to blush at finding me brush in hand. And the truth is, I am too fond of my freedom to exchange it for the embraces of an old woman."" Far from blushing, Helene was to inspire some of the most personal and moving of all Rubens' portraits"

42169-arliqui1.jpg	The Arliquiera is a wooden structure designed to enclose the hospital's precious relics in a niche in the wall of the sacristy of the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala in Siena. Vecchietta's work in the sacristy started with the painting of the Arliquiera.On its outer face the Arliquiera displayed a series of saints and beati who were particularly revered in Siena and in the Spedale. Members of major religious orders were skilfully juxtaposed with members of the lay orders associated with them. Thus below the Dominican friar Ambrogio Sansedoni appeared the Dominican tertiary Catherine of Siena. Represented just above the massive metal bolts that secured the doors of the Arliquiera was the Blessed Agostino Novello, a figure of particular relevance to the Spedale. Believed to have written the rule for the hospital community of Augustinian tertiaries, this Augustinian friar is accordingly shown in the act of bestowing the mantle of office on the kneeling figure of a rector. Above this array of civic saints was placed a sequence of four paintings that portrayed in the outer compartments the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin of the Annunciation and in the centre the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. While the first two figures alluded to the annual display of the relics to the public on the feast of the Annunciation, the second two scenes acted as a reminder of a prized relic held in the Arliquiera - one of the nails believed to have been used at the Crucifixion. The inner surfaces of the doors were painted with eight scenes depicting the Passion. Thus, when the doors were opened, the relics would have been framed by an entire sequence of paintings illustrating the key events that led up to the Crucifixion and Resurrection

39783-09gonzag.jpg	Titian's most important patron in the 1530s was Federico Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua and nephew of Alfonso d'Este. The artist's portrait of Federico is of unsurpassed poise and elegance and may have been intended to support the sitter's matrimonial intentions. The flattery is not unalloyed. The Duke's love of pleasure, indicated by his sumptuous costume and the pampered dog, may be subsumed by his seigneurial dignity but the slight inclination of his head and the small sensuous mouth evoke the flippant selfishness of the same Duke in Verdi's Rigoletto.The way the dog recognizes its master would have been seen as a conventional tribute to the power of portraiture to achieve a vivid likeness

37394-pieta.jpg	This rather smaller copy of the Miraflores Altarpiece by Rogier van der Weyden (c. 1440), painted in Spain by an artist from the Netherlands, Sittow or Juan de Flandes, was long thought to be the original. The painter followed his model in every detail, but in the Piet&#224; he changed the colour of Mary's robe from red to the conventional dark blue. The thinner, less enamel-like style of painting and the slightly broken colouring suggest the later date. The panel has been trimmed at the top

41134-garden_e.jpg	In the legendary world of a multicoloured garden surrounded by a wall the Virgin, the Child Jesus, three holy women and three holy men have met. This enclosed garden (hortus conclusus) is the symbol of the Virgin's purity, with its peaceful mood, its protected area, its fruits and flowers, but the serpentine intertwinement of the two trunks of the trees on the left also reminds us of the Garden of Eden, the scene of the happy life of the first human couple. Even more does the picture intend to evoke the ancient, original harmony of the universe, of divine, human, animal and vegetable worlds, where sin and evil were present only in a latent, harmless form. The Satan-monkey is squatting helplessly at St Michael's feet, while St George's dragon, not at all awe-inspiring, seems to be basking in the sun, turning his belly upwards.The patron who commissioned the picture may have seen his own ornamental garden in the flowers, herbs, birds, butterflies and dragonflies, all represented with scientific exactness. However, this true-to-life interpretation, in a manner characteristic of the International Gothic style, is restricted only to certain minor motifs. The garden, the table, the fountain and the musical instrument are depicted from a different angle and are seen from above and thus they are not included in the plane of the picture; the figures are airily light and the forms do not cast shadows. Like patterns on a carpet the details are rather close to one another and are represented in a two-dimensional way. The forms of the world of humans, of the vegetation and of objects are harmoniously fitted to one another. The crowns are golden garlands of flowers, the left arm of St Cecilia holds a psaltery and the outlines of her instrument form a single vigorous arch of mirrored symmetry, and the parallel lines of grasses appear to be growing from the strings of the psaltery

43538-vekemans.jpg	There are four portraits of the Vekemans family in the collection of Mayer an den Bergh. Joris Vekemans was a prominent AAntwerp merchant, as witnessed by the wealth displayed in these portraits. He died in 1625, shortly after the birth of his sixth child. He probably commissioned all portraits at once, some time before January 1625. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that two of the portraits are not entirely finished, probably due to the unexpected death of the man who ordered them.The portraits are all conceived as pairs. De Vos treated the subjects in each pair in a similar manner, as we can see from the corresponding poses, background and colouring, which create a strong sense of unity between them.With his portraits of the Vekemans family Cornelis de Vos left behind the stereotypical faces of his early works, creating instead a series of very realistic characters - the children's faces are charming, imbued with a sense of youthful pride and shyness. It is, of course, the treatment of the face that lends a successful portrait its expressive power.The portrait of Elisabeth Vekemans is incomplete, as we see from the unfinished background, the somewhat casual execution of the skirt and the absence of the mainly deep red, intensely colourful details like the socks, tie, jewellery and so on that might have enlivened the sombre, green palette. Even so, the portrait stands out for the sureness with which the face is rendered and the daring highlights in the outer garment, which skillfully suggest the material. The portrait is fairly unusual for its time. Life-size, full-length portraits of young girls only really appear in De Vos's work from the 1630s onwards

21829-pauline2.jpg	Lef�vre probably painted Napoleon's favourite sister Marie-Pauline (1780-1825) more frequently than any other artist. This painting shows the princess, who had a great zest for life, as a mythological figure. The subject gave the artist the opportunity to display his talents both as a portrait painter and as master of the mythological subject. But that also shows that the Baroque tradition of allegory was not entirely broken. The landscape in the painting suggest Arcadia, but the Tempietto at Tivoli also documents the Princess' new domain. The figures look as if they are floating, the fluttering cloths form sharp-edged bunches, and Daphne's light feet are like those of a ballet dancer. It is a feature frequently  to be found in Lef�vre's work

37006-comique.jpg	Whistler's followers included Theodore Roussel, Paul Maitland, Walter Richard Sickert and the young Wilson Steer - that is, the artists widely considered the leading British Impressionists. With Sidney Starr they split off from the New English Art Club. This sub-group used the label London Impressionists. The driving force was Sickert who outlined the task facing British Impressionism: to record the magic and poesy that lay all around in everyday life. London, the great metropolis, provided all the stimulating subject-matter that was necessary.The concentration on London subject-matter was apparent in the work of Sickert, Starr, Roussel and the latter's pupil Maitland. Urban problems resulting from 19th-century expansion in the cities - such as unemployment, poverty, child labour, alcoholism and prostitution -  were almost totally absent from this art. The city was being viewed as a predominantly middle-class thing.The music-hall pictures occupy a central position in Sickert's oeuvre. They are skilful, effective exercises in using the contrast between the bright stage and dark auditorium. Like Degas, Sickert worked in the studio from preliminary studies. One of the first of the music-hall pictures was Lion Comique

41924-sebastia.jpg	This painting narrates the moment preceding the martyrdom of St Sebastian, when on the orders of Diocletian he was tied to a stake in the middle of the military esplanade before serving as a live target for the Emperor's archers.As regards Vaccaro's training, the influence of Caravaggio was decisive, together with the personal interpretation of the latter by Ribera, who was in Naples from 1616 onwards &#150; and both these artists were to leave their mark on Vaccaro's earliest work. The painter's artistic curiosity then shifted towards Guido Reni, Massimo Stanzione and the young Bernardo Cavallino.

16657-s_cather.jpg	The artist was already in his mid-sixties when he embarked on ten scenes from the Life of St Catherine, commissioned by the Hospital immediately after the Sienese Pope Pius II had secured her controversial canonization in 1461. Giovanni would have known her story intimately: working at San Domenico as a young man, he must have met many of her surviving friends and followers. Catherine had prayed to Christ to give her a new, pure heart; a few days later, 'elevated in rapture... her heart leapt out of her body, entered Christ's side, and was made one with his heart'. Here, Catherine levitates outside her greenish grey convent with its pink roofs; the operation is under way, as she holds her left hand to her bosom, and stretches forth her right, her scarlet heart spurting blood. Christ rears up behind his own image as the Man of Sorrows above the open church door

23058-41nichol.jpg	The panel (and another also in the Uffizi) came from the church of St Procolo in Florence where it was recorded by Vasari. Presumably it was painted as side wing of a triptych which had a figure of St Nicholas in the central panel (which has disappeared) during the second visit of Ambrogio to Florence between 1327 and 1332, or later. Another possibility is that the panels made up a tabernacle door.The upper scene represents St Nicholas giving dowry to three virgins. An impoverished nobleman is ready to prostitute his three daughters as no one will accept them in marriage without dowries. To save them from such a dishonourable fate, Nicholas, on three consecutive nights, throws each of them a bag full of gold through their window.The lower scene shows Nicholas' consecration as bishop

The inspiration for this picture came during a boating expedition Sargent took on the Thames at Pangbourne in September 1885, when he saw Chinese lanterns hanging among trees and lilies. The title comes from the song 'The Wreath', by the eighteenth-century composer of operas Joseph Mazzinghi, which was popular in the 1880s. The refrain of the song asks the question 'Have you seen my Flora pass this way?' to which the answer is 'Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose'

35609-11landsc.jpg	With the famous Flemish Kermis, Rubens reinforced his reputation as a Protean artist by showing himself the sole heir of the great Bruegel - whose works he collected. At Het Steen, he was immensely happy, wandered among the trees, discovered his landscape gifts, and anticipated the discoveries of Impressionism. Whereas the landscape artists of his time tended to consider the little figures with which their paintings were studded as mere accessories, to be entrusted for the most part to the diligence of their assistants, Rubens restored man's prominence, and showed him sharing in the seasonal life of nature. In the Brueghelian Kermis, Rubens returned to a traditional Flemish scene, with all its familiar episodes: here the joyful tread of the dancing, there the coarse antics of the drunk. But the sheer sweep of the painting frees the subject from its usual tenor of vulgarity and triviality.

13097-scipio.jpg	The episode depicted, narrated by Livy and Valerius Maximus, tells of how after the taking of Carthage in 209 BC Scipio had treated with respect a beautiful virgin, one of the hostages who had been consigned to him, and had sent her back to her intended husband and parents with the sole recommendation that her suitor strived for peace between Rome and Carthage. The parents present themselves before Scipio, enthroned after his victory, who refuses to accept the gold of the ransom they have brought, while the maiden's gallant, with sword and helmet, listens to the generous sentence.

07562-44jerome.jpg	Just as Protestants wished to translate the Bible into local languages to make the Word of God accessible to ordinary believers, so Catholics were keen to justify the use of the standard Latin version, made by St Jerome in the late fourth century. Jerome had been baptized by one pope, had been given his task as translator by another and had called St Peter the first bishop of Rome. Among the Latin Fathers of the Church he was a powerful ally against modern heretics, who attacked the cult of the saints, restricted the use of Latin to the learned and viewed the papacy as the whore of Babylon. It was wholly appropriate that this image was bought by Scipione Borghese soon after he was made a cardinal in 1605 by his uncle, the new Pope Paul V.In pre-Reformation days Jerome was shown with a pet lion and a cardinal's hat. Now Catholic reformers wished to pare religious art down to its essentials, and the good-living cardinal, whose ample features were to be sculpted and caricatured by Bernini, acquired a painting that was as austere as it was sombre. The thin old man, whose face is reminiscent of the model who had been Abraham, Matthew and one of the Apostles with Thomas, sits reflecting on a codex of the Bible while his right hand is poised to write. Whereas in the Renaissance, Antonello da Messina and D�rer had made him into a wealthy scholar, Caravaggio reduces Jerome's possessions to a minimum. The text he holds open, a second closed one and a third kept open by a skull are perched on a small table. Harsh lighting emphasizes the sinewy muscles of his tired arms and the parallel between his bony head and the skull - man is born to die, but the Word of God lives forever

23890-5late09.jpg	In the winter of 1881/82 Manet painted a picture that can stand as a summation of his art: A Bar at the Folies-Berg�re. Now exempt (as an award winner) from the jury process, he exhibited it at the 1882 Salon. Recent scholars have rightly been fascinated by the qualities of the painting and the intensity and diversity of Manet's renewed analysis of part of the society he lived in.The colours are rather subdued (which may be intended to convey the smoky somnolence of the pleasure palace), but on the other hand Manet gives us first-rate proof of his still-life talent in the foreground. The hard, cold quality of the white light globes is perfectly caught, they are like buttons on the canvas. Manet's pastose brushwork creates a unified tapestry of colour correspondences and contrasts across the various spatial levels. Those levels themselves are intentionally confusing: most of what we see is a reflection in the bar mirror behind the woman. The laws of perspective are broken in a fashion that was a radical departure at the time. The woman's back is reflected at an angle

18067-12scene.jpg	In the next fresco of the cycle, a boy on the left is attempting to use a spoon to transfer all the waters of the ocean into a little hollow. The episode is described in an apocryphal letter of Cyril of Jerusalem, and shows that the client was a particularly good expert on literature concerning St Augustine. In the letter Cyril writes that St Augustine, while thinking about the Trinity, met a small child on the beach who was attempting to ladle out the oceans using a spoon. When St Augustine explained to him how impossible his plan was, the boy replied by telling him that the mystery of the Holy Trinity was also not something that could be comprehended by the human mind. The scene is a parable of the unbridgeable gap between faith and reason.In the middle distance, St Augustine is sitting surrounded by a circle of monks on a bare path leading to a monastery on the top of the mountain. The Visit to the Monks of Mount Pisano is depicted for the first time in this fresco, emphasizing its uniqueness. In the foreground on the right, St Augustine is giving the rule of the order to the hermit monks. He is wearing the dress of Augustinian hermits, a black habit with a pointed hood, leather belt and shoes.There is no historical proof of St Augustine's journey to Tuscany. The event is also not mentioned in the Confessions. However, oral tradition has it that St Augustine stayed in Tuscany after his mother's death. Due to grief at the loss of his mother, he is said to have forgotten to write it down. According to tradition, St Augustine visited the hermit monks of Mount Pisano. This legend was very popular as it suggested that the Augustinian hermits had originated in Tuscany. In fact, St Augustine founded his community in the fourth century in northern Africa. The rule of the Augustinians, dating from 388/389, is the oldest Western monastic rule. In 12 short chapters it lays down the fundamentals of monastic life. The goals of the monastic community are poverty, brotherly love, obedience, prayer, reading the Scriptures, work and apostolic work: a life characterized by seclusion and humility.Not until 1256 did Pope Alexander (1254-1261) found the order of Augustinian hermits by combining several Italian groups of hermits who had been living according to the rule of St Augustine since 1243

09440-watson.jpg	After the death of his father, a tobacco merchant of Irish descent, Copley first received instruction from his stepfather, the etcher Peter Pelham. As a painter Copley was largely self- taught, studying copies of old masters and also printing techniques and using all available sources of contemporary European painting. In his early twenties he was already a popular portraitist, receiving commissions from New York, Philadelphia and Canada. From 1765 onwards he exhibited in London, where his work was well received by his fellow painters. Following West's invitation, he at last visited England himself in 1774 to perfect his technique. His travels on the Continent were short but intensive. When in London he painted several striking historical pictures, including Brook Watson being attacked by a Shark, whose topicality had a revolutionary effect. He was made an associate (1775) and then a full member of the Royal Academy (1783). Around this time he began to align himself more with European conventions, a tendency which became more pronounced with advancing years

17805-709goya.jpg	Goya was especially fond of his only grandson, Mariano, who was born on 11 July 1806. He painted his portrait on several occasions. There is an earlier full-length portrait of him by Goya aged about four and a head and shoulders of him as a young man in 1827. In the present portrait he appears to be six to eight years old. Seated beside an enormous musical score he is beating time with a roll of paper. This natural gesture, the informal pose and the thoughtful look on the child's face combine to make this one of the most intimate of Goya's portraits and reflects the great affection that he is known to have had for his grandson. It was to Mariano that Goya gave the Quinta del Sordo, the house containing the Black Paintings.The painting is signed on the back of the panel: 'Goya, a su nieto' (Goya, to his grandson)

34825-s_bernar.jpg	The mature Roelas excelled at creating monumental altarpieces replete with figures and teeming with incident. However, he also brought new life to smaller, more intimate religious subjects, such as the Vision of St Bernard, executed for the hospital of San Bernard in 1611. Here the saint is represented in a study that is furnished with a shelf lined with parchment-bound books. In front of the bookcase is a realistic glass vase holding symbolic lilies. St Bernard is a portrait-like type with a narrow head, a sharp nose, and sunken eyes, and his face expresses silent rapture as the Virgin's milk bathes his forehead. Roelas was able to capture as no Sevillian artist before him the intense piety, earthy realism, and love of spectacle that characterized the devotional practices of Andalusia, and thus he made a profound impact on many younger painters, notably Francisco de Zurbar�n

22714-2adorati.jpg	"From the mid-1450s through the mid-1460s, Filippo Lippi evolved a new presentation of the Virgin and Child that became popular in the second half of the Quattrocento in Florence. The composition and iconography were grounded in two traditions: St Bridget of Sweden's account of her vision of the Virgin adoring the Christ Child lying upon the ground, and early Renaissance Tuscan depictions of the Nativity. Fra Filippo transformed the subject into a distinct devotional image set within an elaborated forested landscape with a rich imagery of sylvan flora, geological features, and atmosphere, which functioned as visual metaphors for the Incarnation, penitence, and eremitical religious devotion.Fra Filippo's first version of this type was ostensibly a Nativity, made for the Benedictine Annalena nunnery around 1455. In this composition St Joseph is present beside the Virgin and Child, the ass and ox lie placidly in the manger, and shepherds look on, while angels bearing the inscription ""Gloria in excelsis Deo"" hover above.Lippi's subsequent elaborations of this type, however, omit these narrative markers: the triptych for Alfonso of Naples, whose lost central panel is known only through a rapid sketch by Fra Filippo and the surviving wings representing Sts Anthony Abbot and Michael, the altarpiece for the chapel in the Palazzo Medici, and a painting said to have come from a cell in the Camaldoli hermitage, dedicated to the Baptist and patronized by Piero di Cosimo de' Medici and his wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni, built in 1463.These images are set in a dark, wooden landscape where the Madonna kneels, her hands clasped together in devotion, before the Christ Child lying virtually nude upon the verdant forest ground. God the Father (or simply his hands) in the Camaldoli picture) appears above and the Holy Spirit descends toward the Child, proceeded by tongues of fire. The Child is surrounded by an aura of dancing gilded flames and the Virgin and Child truly glow with divine light.This painting was commissioned in about 1463 by Lucrezia Tornabuoni, the wife of Piero de' Medici, for the hermitage of Camaldoli. The represented saints are the Young St John the Baptist and St Romuald"

32197-02battle.jpg	"The subject of the painting is taken from the Old Testament, Amalek is a figure in the Hebrew Bible. The Amalekites were a people mentioned a number of times in the book of Genesis, and considered to be Amalek's descendents. The Biblical relationship between the Hebrew and Amalekite tribes was that the Amalekite tribes without provocation pounced on the Hebrews when they were weak. The Amalekites became associated with ruthlessness and trickery and tyranny. David waged a sacred war of extermination against the Amalekites, who may have subsequently disappeared from history.Poussin's paintings display a highly idiosyncratic French rationalism. Already in this early work, one of the first painted after his arrival in Italy, he places two radically distinct subjects - the ""thick of battle"" and Moses praying (which ultimately decides the outcome) - into a tight picture space, distorting proportions but, in exchange, achieving unity and extreme intensity of action"

19345-sunset.jpg	Hassam also painted landscapes. He probably first summered on Appledore, an island off the coast of New Hampshire and Maine, in 1884. For many years until 1894, the Appledore landscape provided Hassam with inspiration. Later he continued to visit both Appledore and New England coastal towns in the summers. The seascapes he painted on those visits in the early years of the twentieth century introduced a new component into his work. In Sunset at Sea, for instance, the almost monochrome bands of colour record a vision of the vastness of the ocean, in a style that has Symbolist undertones and looks forward to American abstract art

Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan from 1450 to 1466, is portrayed with a certain surface realism, but the main intent is to show him as a polite and princely figure rather than a heroic one, which is perfectly in tune with the painter's archaic International Gothic taste.

16082-joachi6.jpg	In the last fresco of the upper register the composition is concentrated on the encounter between Joachim and Anne: Joachim is accompanied by a shepherd, who is partly cut off in the fresco. On the one hand, Giotto uses this completely new device in painting to create the impression that the succession of pictures, intersected by the framework, would unfold before our eyes in one continuous procession. On the other hand, a figure cut short in such a manner increases the dynamics within the picture field and makes us focus on the action at its centre.Even the verticals of the architecture and the golden arch of the city gate respectively illustrate and mirror the way the couple lean towards one another. The two meet on a bridge, on the border between the outside world and the security of the city. They embrace with great tenderness and kiss one another. The way in which the volumes of the figures fuse underlines the tenderness of the moment, in which the faces also melt, as it were, into one another.The story of Mary's parents begins with a painful rejection and concludes with this intense encounter. The sensitive portrayal of their meeting already contains the germ for the start of the next narrative, which commences with the Birth of the Virgin Mary and which leads to the youth of Christ by way of the Bridal Procession of the Virgin

10904-adoratio.jpg	This work, the style and technique of which are typical of Gerard David, has long been attributed to him. After Hans Memling's death, Gerard David came to be viewed as one of the best painters in Bruges, where he worked from 1484 until his death.The narration of Christ's nativity in St Matthew's Gospel produced a whole series of medieval stories and legends in which artists found iconographic inspiration. The Adoration of the Magi that Gerard David painted around 1500 takes place in the ruins of a palace serving as a stable. In the foreground the Virgin, seated on the edge of a manger, presents the Child to the three magi, Caspar, Melchior and Balthazar, who have arrived to offer gold, incense and myrrh, symbols of his kingship, his divinity and his sacrifice. Resting on his walking stick, Joseph stands next to his young wife. The magi symbolise the three ages of life, but also the three continents known at the time, Europe, Africa and Asia. They are accompanied by a large retinue, certain members of which escort them to the Child. The others wait, at a distance, on their mounts. Their exotic costumes and the presence of a camel indicate that they have come from afar. To the right a shepherd observes them. In the distance, to the left, above the town of Bethlehem, shines the star that has guided them.The subject is treated in the iconographic tradition of the time. The ruins could be an allusion to King David's palace or an evocation of the fallen synagogue. Gerard David has nonetheless opted to represent the episode of the adoration of the magi in a wider context by multiplying the figures present at the scene, thereby strengthening the significance and importance of this event. It is not impossible that these include portraits of the painter's contemporaries. The man to the right of the pillar could be a self-portrait of Gerard David, though this cannot be proved. The same hypothesis has been formulated for the man looking at the spectators in the far left of the scene. Gerard David has produced a realistic, palpable and convincing rendering of this episode of Christ's incarnation, in the manner of the Flemish Primitives of whom he is one of the last representatives

14081-port_lad.jpg	The sitter, painted almost full-length, is seated on a stone plinth behind which rise up two pilasters, with what seems to be a niche in-between them. The plain architectural background in the style of the period infuses the painting with a sense of solemnity and isolation which accentuates the sitter's expression, halfway between serious and sad. With lowered eyes, she fixes her gaze on no particular spot, as if absorbed in her thoughts, perhaps inspired by the book which she is holding.The figure is depicted in slight contrapposto, with the head turned in the opposite direction to the body, conforming with Mannerist taste. This pose, initially conceived to give naturalness and movement to the figures, was so constantly repeated that it reached a point where it became purely a convention and no longer conveyed the spontaneity which was originally intended. This was, in fact, to be the ultimate destiny of Mannerism, which by refining the figure to such an extent, left it empty of content

03827-113madon.jpg	Bellini was one of the great geniuses of the Renaissance; his use of colour to achieve rich, atmospheric effects became the hallmark of Venetian art of the Renaissance. In addition to large altarpieces, Bellini also painted devotional images of the Madonna and Child for domestic settings. In spite of their modest size and conventional theme, these paintings invariably exhibit a remarkably fresh, inventive approach. The Madonna in this painting is aligned with the vertical axis of the picture, but the rust-coloured cloth of honour and the position of the tenderly held Child introduce a daring asymmetry. The beautifully painted landscape, incorporating a distant view of the Alps, serves to balance the composition and underscores the still, poignant mood of the picture. The quince held by the Child is a symbol of the Resurrection

37482-pantry.jpg	"A pupil of Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Frans Snyders was admitted as a free master to the Guild of St Luke in 1602. He then spent time in Italy before returning to settle permanently in Antwerp in 1609. At a time when orders were pouring in, painters made use of specialised colleagues for certain parts of the works. Artists like Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens and Cornelis de Vos all called on Frans Snyders to produce the animal motifs in their paintings.The scene is set in the kitchen of a vast house. A maidservant, said to be painted by Cornelis de Vos, is carrying a tray full of quails and crowned with a pheasant. Her head turned to the right, she is standing alongside a large rectangular table spilling over with victuals. The painting is organised on several levels around a white swan, whose body and outstretched wings occupy the centre of the scene. Next to it, a gutted roebuck is hanging by one paw from a hook. A lobster, a peacock and some birds are laid out on the table. A wicker basket spilling over with fruit and a copper basin with quarters of meat add to the impression of abundance. A rack at the top of the painting from which hang two salmon steaks, birds and two hares, strengthens the horizontal aspect of the composition. In the left foreground, a plate of oysters is placed on a bench, whilst, to the far right, a wicker basked is laden profusely with fruits and vegetables. A cat, preparing to steal fish from a serving dish, and a dog, avidly viewing the servant's plate, provide a lively contrast to the dead animals.The Pantry is similar to monumental paintings mixing people and still-lifes created by Aertsen, Beuckelaer and Lucas van Valckenborch. The work probably has a deeper meaning. It would well be that the poultry, the parrot, the dog, the cat and the roebuck embody the five senses, whilst the birds, the fish, the fruit and vegetables, the lobster and the game symbolise the four elements of air, water, earth and fire respectively. In the same order of things, the maidservant and the birds (the Dutch word ""vogelen"", literally ""to bird"", also refers to the sexual act) are perhaps an allusion to worldly temptations and to physical love"

37947-family.jpg	"Steen was a storyteller with a passion for drawing moral conclusions in his numerous pictures based on the Scripture, old proverbs, aphorisms, and emblems. Much of Steen's moralizing is based upon familiar platitudes. 'Easy come, easy go' was a favourite. Here, Steen has depicted the proverb 'As the old sing, so pipe the young', meaning that a bad example leads to bad conduct. He frequently includes an inscription in his paintings to make his meaning clear. Many of his exuberant pictures of families around a festive table, where grown-ups, children, and animals make an ingenious hotch-potch, are designed to illustrate well-known proverbs. This is the subject of the group eating, making music, drinking, smoking, laughing and shouting in this picture at the Mauritshuis.Here Steen introduced himself giving a boy a a pipe, and there have been attempts to identify three generations of his family in the painting. The old woman sings the song written on the sheet of paper she holds:""As we sing you'll have to chirrup, / It's a law the whole world knows. / I lead, all follow suit, / From baby to centenarian.""In this major work, which is large in size and broader in execution than most, an abundance of animating details illustrate the obvious moral. It was executed when Steen was in Haarlem and had the opportunity to study at firsthand a number of Frans Hals's pictures. The tonality is light, and the dominant hues are Steen's favourite ones: violet, rose, salmon-red, pale yellow, and bluish-green"

19564-musician.jpg	In style and execution this painting is a typical work of Bartholomeus van der Helst's mature years. The woman tunes a theorbo-lute, and a viola da gamba rests in front of her. Some scholars have considered the picture to be an allegory or personification of music. Later writers have treated the painting as a genre scene, comparing works by Gerrit Dou, Johannes Vermeer, and other contemporary artists. The picture is very close in date and in its main motifs to Vermeer's Woman with a Lute near a Window. However, it was also suggested that the artist's wife, Anna du Pire might have served as a model for the Musician.

18958-madonna.jpg	"On top of the painting Christ Blessing and Two Angels are represented.In thirteenth-century Siena several lay organizations existed whose members regularly attended masses, participated in religious processions, prayed together and sang hymns or ""laude"". One kind of confraternities, the ""Laudesi"" took their name from their custom of singing laude. These were frequently written in honour of the Virgin and Laudesi companies therefore often used a painted image of the Virgin and Christ Child as a focal point of their collective act of singing. The most imposing examples of thirteenth-century Sienese paintings that survive today have been associated with them, including Guido da Siena's panel painting of the Virgin and Christ Child Enthroned, which is the only certain work of the artist.The picture bears the date 1221. but this has been the subject of much controversy as stylistically the painting seems to belong about half a century later. It has been suggested that the inscription may have some commemorative purpose, the significance of which is now lost, rather than being a record of the date of execution.Although the painting is majestic in effect and follows Byzantine conventions of iconography, the figures are more natural in posture, to some extent relaxing the stiff linear patterns which had been conventional in central Italian painting up to that time. The throne too is set in a deeper picture space, which adds to the realism of the figures.On the basis of this picture a number of other panels, most of which are in the Siena Pinacoteca, have been assigned to Guido or his school. Despite his great obscurity, he is regarded as sharing with Coppo di Marcovaldo the honour of founding the Sienese School"

31902-y_woman1.jpg	In the late fifteenth century, the brothers Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo ran an active workshop in Florence, producing sculptures, goldsmith work, and painting. There was also a considerable graphic output. By 1450, Antonio was already a renowned goldsmith, and he was also active as a sculptor, in particular of bronzes. Documents refer solely to Piero as the executing artist for certain paintings.The Pollaioulo workshop produced a group of profile portraits of ladies. This group has been the subject of controversy, particularly regarding which work was executed by which brother. Technical and stylistic analysis of the group led to the conclusion that the portraits in Berlin and Milan can be attributed to Antonio, while those in Florence and New York are the works by Piero.

37988-m_rosary.jpg	The theme of the painting is akin to that of the picture by the Master of the Upper Rhineland. In this picture too, the Virgin is seated on the ground in the middle of an enclosed flower garden, in which a spring gushes forth. She is accompanied only by St Catherine of Alexandria and by a great many angels. However, whereas the Frankfurt picture, though it is harmonious like a fairytale, opens up to us a world in which everyday events are beautified, but a world in which one could live, Stefano's painting shows an unapproachable world, which we could not penetrate, experience or live in. This is so not only on account of the figures' expressions suggesting timelessness and not only because of the golden fountain which reminds one of goldsmiths' works for liturgical purposes (in contrast to which the fountain in the picture from the Upper Rhineland is so realistic that it has a ladle, fastened to it with a chain), nor is it due to the sword and wheel (St Catherine's attributes), which bar the spectator from entering the foreground of the Verona picture. It is unapproachable, first of all, because the spatial surroundings are almost undefinable and figures and objects appear to be totally sublime. The ground and the enclosure of the garden, depicted as though seen from above, are of a golden brown hue, and this basic tone is very close to the neutral gold of the background - so a virtually homogeneous surface is created. If we examine it more carefully we shall be surprised to find how intricate the ground-plan of this garden is: its left rear corner juts out, while the enclosure, as soon as it reaches the edge of the picture, changes its direction so as to enclose the front corners too. But due to the homogeneity of forms and colours all this is scarcely noticeable. Against this tapestry- like surface the graceful forms of the figures and plants, often resembling one another, stand out as a decorative ornamental pattern (see, for example, the similarity of the wings of the angels and of the peacocks). In contrast to the Master of the Upper Rhineland, Stefano da Verona did not set carefully observed details of nature side by side but stylized forms and turned them into ornaments.It is the dark area of the Virgin's mantle that stands out most markedly from the homogeneous background. She is seated on a black cushion on the ground, the cushion being surrounded by roses of various colours placed at equal distances from each other. The Madonna is the queen not only of the idyllic empire of timeless harmony, but of the world of eternal, deep sorrow too. She stares sadly into space. The pose in which she sits on the ground is the same in which she is to lament over her dead Son. In fact, the red roses also refer to the martyrdom of Christ, and the numerous dark colours prefigure the austere tones of the Passion

12475-04self22.jpg	This is D�rer's first painted self portrait, dated 1493. It is the earliest known self portrait in European art produced as an independent painting (although earlier artists had sometimes portrayed themselves among figures in an altarpiece or fresco). A sketched self portrait, dated 1493 on the reverse, could well have been an early study for the oil painting. D�rer completed the oil painting towards the end of his travels as a journeyman, almost certainly in Strasbourg. It was originally on vellum, which would have made it relatively simple to transport, and this suggests that it might well have been sent back to Nuremberg.D�rer inscribed at the top of the self portrait: `Things with me fare as ordained from above', a sign of his faith in God. The artist's youthful features are framed by his lanky, ginger hair, which is topped by a red tasselled cap. Beneath his grey cloak, fringed with red, he wears an elegant pleated shirt with pink ribbons. His strong nose, heart-shaped upper lip and long neck are emphasized in the painting. Using a mirror, D�rer obviously found it difficult to paint his hands and eyes, the two features which are always a challenge in a self portrait.In his rough hands, D�rer holds a sprig of sea holly, a thistle-like plant. Its German name means `man's fidelity' and this, together with the fact that the plant was sometimes regarded as an aphrodisiac, has led to speculation that the self portrait was intended as a gift for his fianc�e. While D�rer was away, his father had arranged for Agnes Frey to become his wife and they eventually married on 7 July 1494, two months after his return to Nuremberg. However, it is just as likely that the self portrait was a gift for his parents, whom he had not seen for nearly four years. One can imagine the surprise and pleasure they must have felt to receive this picture after their son's long absence. It would have been a reminder of his handsome features and further evidence of his blossoming talent

19977-3pembert.jpg	This image of the twenty-three-year-old Mrs Robert Pemberton (c. 1518-1588), the wife of a prosperous London cloth merchant, is acknowledged to be one of Holbein's masterpieces in this genre, transcending the wooden-looking figures that Horenbout had been producing for about a decade before. Mounted in suitably precious settings, such portraits could be worn as costume jewelry. Holbein's miniature portraits made a very important contribution to a branch of English painting that would become very popular over the following centuries.Holbein's working methods, using preliminary drawings as for full-scale portraiture, enabled him to capture mood and character memorably. The sitter's intent but gentle gaze out of the picture space and the subtlety of the colouring, which prefigures the austerity of his non-royal subjects from the later 1530s, condense the full presence of a life and personality onto a tiny surface area. The static, calm pose insists on the sitter's dignity - only the artist's assurance equals hers.As with many privately commissioned miniatures, devised as keepsakes, it is set in a locket. This tradition, originating in the exchange of images between European monarchs and nobility as tokens of diplomatic goodwill, may be contrasted with the sharing of adulatory portraits of intellectual heroes around the circle of Erasmus and More. The miniature represented this form of admiration at its most intimate.Much as they admired his work, neither Nicholas Hilliard (c.1547-1617) nor Isaac Oliver (1563-1619) employed Holbein's acute psychological realism in their own miniatures, developing instead a more emblematic presentation

24164-1self_p.jpg	We know only two self-portraits by M�nyoki: one from his youth, a washed drawing made in 1693 (formerly in Budapest, Lajos Ernst Collection) and this half-figure portrait showing the mature artist. In his charmingly confident craftsman-portrait he depicts himself at work, holding a palette and brushes in his hand, wearing a shirt with rolled-up sleeves, opening over his chest. In a trick of self-portraits popular since Rembrandt, the soft velvet hat with its upturned rim casts a warm brown shadow over the upper half of his face. Those warm reddish-brown half-shades and the tonal richness of the eyes' area modelled with reflexive lights and kept in shadow represent here a completely new, relaxed pictorial quality as compared to M�nyoki's painstaking formation of details made by almost drawing with his brush.

04891-jacob_dr.jpg	In his later career Bol turned to a more courtly style and a lighter tonality, the faces of his models look rather pasty, and the highlights on the red velvet he loved to paint appear to have been dusted lightly with talcum powder. In a subject picture like the Jacob's Dream Bol captures something of the mood and tender character of Rembrandt's art of this period; but the elegant and noble attitude of the angel, with its long limbs and aristocratic gesture, is foreign to Rembrandt

42229-0215vela.jpg	When the Infanta Do&#241;a Mar�a, daughter of Philip III and Queen Margarita, set out for Vienna in December 1629 to meet the husband who had been chosen for her long before, the king of Hungary, later Emperor Ferdinand III, her journey included a stay of several months in Naples in 1630. Vel�zquez made haste to Naples to portray his sovereign's sister', who was famous for her beauty. He worked with the utmost care to emphasize the enamel-like smoothness of her fine features. Every detail, for instance the typically protuberant Habsburg lower lip, shows a striking similarity to the living model. The delicate carmine of her lips, the beautiful Titian shade of her hair, depicted in relaxed brushstrokes with dark brown shadows and bright yellow highlights, all display the artistic skill now at the command of Vel�zquez in his harmonious combination of state splendour with the individuality of his sitter.The carefully modelled face in this head-and-shoulders portrait was to serve as the basis for several full-length portraits of the Infanta, workshop copies that may have been intended as gifts to royal residences abroad

32208-13martyr.jpg	As soon as the Germanicus was completed, an even more important commission was received, this time for the Basilica of St Peter's. It was for a large altarpiece depicting the Martyrdom of St Erasmus. The picture was not a success and, with the exception of the Virgin with St James (Louvre, Paris) which was probably painted for a church in Valenciennes, Poussin painted only one more large altarpiece for a prominent position. The Erasmus is nevertheless important in several ways: it shows Poussin's temporary preoccupation with the Caravaggesque idiom and also his weaknesses as a composer of large altarpieces, demonstrating that he was temperamentally unsuited to the painting of a single picture on a grand scale. Almost all the greatest pictures of his maturity form part of a pair or a series: the first set of Sacraments, the Seasons, and the Crossing of the Red Sea paired with the Adoration of the Golden Calf

12588-9baret.jpg	There is an inscription near his head, monogrammed and dated 152(?). The last digit of the date is not clearly legible (1 or 4?), but the fact that the panel is oak indicates that the painting must have been carried out during D�rer's trip to the Netherlands. The hypotheses regarding the name of the subject are various. The most frequent are: the one of Lorenz Sterck, an administrator and financial curator of the Brabant and of Antwerp, and that of Jobst Plankfelt, D�rer's innkeeper in Antwerp. These names are frequently suggested since D�rer writes in his diary that he had done oil portraits of them.It is difficult to imagine an innkeeper who made himself depicted with a scroll in his hand. Whereas it seems much more plausible that the imposing subject characterized by a severe and scrutinizing gaze - clad in a silk shirt, a cloak with a fur collar, and a large beret - corresponds to a tax collector. But whoever the subject is, the portrait is regardless one of the most beautiful and incisive that D�rer ever created. He manages, with an image constrained by such a limited space, to communicate the impression of being in front of a personality of a supremely concentrated energy - and all that by using simple and pale colours, whose effect is unfortunately partly obfuscated by the heavy varnish covering the painting

05657-forest.jpg	Boucher's pastorals and landscape paintings, which are certainly part of his rococo achievement, are willfully artificial on a basis of real observation. They create a new branch of rococo art in which the growing tendency to shake off dynastic and mythological duties has been completely developed; they are stage settings without characters, or with at most some actor-peasants, in which nature is dressed alluringly as Venus had been undressed.Perhaps Boucher's most enchanted landscapes are those where the stage is set but the characters hardly appear: a rural dream of tranquil nature where man has added only picturesque water wheels, some cottages and a few inevitable doves, and where the taffeta grass, the blue trees, and the pale stretched silk sky create an ingenious, impossible Arcadia more beautiful than any reality. By the mid-1750s Gainsborough in England was achieving similar effects, blending French elegance with native facts and producing idyllic landscapes, often with courting woodcutters and milkmaids

26553-01_2ce1f.jpg	"The ninth (and last) scene in the chronological order of the narrative, The Drunkenness of Noah, is depicted in the centre of the vault of the first bay, between two pairs of ignudi with medallions.The Drunkenness of Noah is an episode that from the time of St Augustine onward was interpreted as the prefiguration of the mocking of Christ. The humiliation of the patriarch, caused by the fruit of the vine, alludes to the Word that humiliates itself by agreeing to become incarnated in the ""vineyard"" of Israel.The four ignudi are the first figures of that kind in the Chapel. Only the head, a shoulder, and the feet are now visible of one of the two ignudi on the north side. The rest of the body was destroyed by the detachment of intonaco caused by the explosion of the powder magazine at Castel Sant'Angelo in 1797. A sixteenth century engraving shows that the figure was a mirror image of the one facing it, and it is likely that it was executed using the same cartoon reversed. The modeling of the ignudi in the first bay contains passages of chiaroscuro displaying greatest contrast than those in the following bays. This lends them an air of hardness.The figures of ignudi bear garlands of oak leaves and acorns - allusions to the Della Rovere family - and ribbons passing through the frames of the large gilded medallions. In them are represented scenes of Bidkar Throwing the Body of the Deposed King Joram from his Chariot in Naboth's Vineyard, and the Murder of Abner.In the medallions, the Destruction of the Statue of the God Baal and the Killing of Uriah are depicted"

02899-granida.jpg	Granida and Daifilo were lovers from the Dutch pastoral play Granida (1605) by Pieter Hooft. Granida, the daughter of an eastern king, betrothed to Prince Tisiphernes, lost her way while out hunting. She came upon a shepherd Daifilo and his mistress Dorilea who had just quarrelled. Daifilo fetched water for the princess to drink and fell in love with her. He followed her to court and, after several turns in the story, they fled to the woods together to live a pastoral life. Daifilo was taken prisoner by one of Granida's several suitors. They were finally reunited after the intervention of Tisiphernes who yielded his claim to her. The play set a fashion for pastoral idyll in the Netherlands and long remained popular

35455-02samson.jpg	In 1608 Rubens hastily returned home to Antwerp after an absence of eight years in Italy, in a vain attempt to reach the bedside of his dying mother. His arrival in the city virtually coincided with the truce between Spanish Flanders and the Dutch United Provinces, and he was quickly appointed official painter to the Regents of the Southern Netherlands, the Archduke Albert and the Archduchess Isabella, with leave to remain domiciled in Antwerp. He was never to return to Italy, although he was irrevocably marked by his study of ancient Greco-Roman and Italian Renaissance art. In Antwerp he proceeded to work towards the reconstruction of his war-torn country and to establish himself as a leading figure in its artistic and intellectual life.One of his closest friends and patrons at this time was the wealthy and influential alderman Nicolaas Rockocx, for whom Rubens painted Samson and Delilah to hang in a prominent position over the mantelpiece of his `great saloon' in Antwerp. When the picture was hung at its original height of just over two metres (seven feet) some years ago in an exhibition at the National Gallery, it became clear how nicely Rubens had calculated the angle of vision. The surface of Delilah's bed receded to a properly horizontal plane, with the space of the room leading convincingly back to the wall and the door through which the Philistine soldiers enter to capture the hapless Jewish hero. To the multiple light sources in this room, for which Rubens was indebted to his friend Elsheimer - the flaming brazier, the candle held by the old procuress and the torch of the Philistines - we must add in our mind's eye a fire blazing in the fireplace below, highlighting the saffron satin throw behind Delilah and the patterned Oriental rug, and casting warm reflections in the shadows of the skin tones and the white drapery, where the coarse brown hatching of the underpaint is left uncovered or barely veiled.The story of Samson's fatal passion for Delilah is told in the Old Testament (Judges 16:4-6, 16-21). Bribed by his Philistine enemies, she cozens Samson into revealing the source of his supernatural strength: his uncut hair. As he lies asleep in her lap during a night of love, she calls in a barber to cut off `the seven locks of his head'. The tale of a man brought low by lust for a woman was often treated in sixteenth-century Netherlandish art, and Rubens follows this Northern tradition by introducing a procuress, who does not appear in the Bible. Her profile juxtaposed with that of the youthful harlot both reveals her own past and suggests Delilah's future. At the same time, the painting is rich in Italian memories, not least in the ample scale of its life-size foreground figures, accommodated on the panel only by being shown reclining. A statue of Venus and Cupid presides over the erotic scene. Brawny Samson derives from antique sculpture and from Michelangelo; Delilah's pose is that of Michelangelo's Leda and Night in reverse. In Delilah's breast band Rubens draws on Roman marbles, but following his own maxim translates marble into soft and yielding flesh - some of the fleshiest ever painted.Ultimately, however, this sumptuous picture is entirely original, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the incongruously dainty professional gesture of the barber and in Delilah's ambiguous expression, compounded of sensuality, triumph and pity.

43941-kalmthou.jpg	"The kneeling couple, Arnold of Louvain (d. 1250) and his wife Elisabeth of Breda, bequeathed the district of Kalmthout to a monastery in the 13th century. Consequently the couple, long dead, are shown here holding small plots of earth with trees growing on them. They are giving their gift to the Virgin Mary as its actual recipient, since in the Middle Ages only real people and not institutions could represent legal entities, so that a pious donation had to be bequeathed to a saint.Goossen van der Weyden must have inherited his grandfather's workshop stocks from his father, and despite their considerable age used them in paintings of his own. In his The Gift of Kalmthout, he probably based the lady to the right on a drawing after Rogier's portrait of Isabella of Portugal (J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu). The costume, imitated from Rogier's model but old-fashioned by the early 16th century, acquires new significance in this particular context, since his picture refers to a gift made in the 13th century, and the couple it shows had therefore been dead for centuries. While the figural types are of the 15th century, the style of painting and the background landscape betray the influence of modern art as practiced in Antwerp, where Goossen had settled around 1499. His descent obviously remained a source of pride to the painter, who at the age of 70 was still referring to his grandfather in the inscription on an altarpiece for the abbey church of Tongerlo. In a form of panegyric widely current at the time, and referring to the most famous painter of classical antiquity, he described Rogier as ""the Apelles of his age."

03738-mehmet2.jpg	Gentile Bellini visited Constantinople from 1479 to 1481. The trip was undertaken in the wake of the peace treaty made between Venice and the Turkish sultan, Mehmet II, who took the opportunity of asking the Venetian Senate to send him a good portrait painter.The portrait was the first work in which Gentile shifted the position of the sitter's head and body away from pure profile toward the three-quarter view made fashionable by Antonello da Messina. Also, in an unusual variation on the illusionistic motif of the foreground parapet, he framed the sitter in a classicising archway and draped the high sill with a cloth of gold richly studded with jewels.It is possible that the sultan commissioned the portrait as a diplomatic gift for the doge. The widespread curiosity in Italy about Gentile's visit and about the appearance of the sultan led to the creation of a number of copies and variants of the image, presumably on the basis of the painter's preparatory drawing. After his return to Venice in 1481, Gentile also designed a portrait medal of Mehmet, likewise for the purpose of wide circulation

14052-sebastia.jpg	In its original position in a chapel in Santa Maria di Brera, this fresco had greater visual impact, with the archers appearing illusionistically before the spectator as if they had come out from behind the wall. For this reason the painting was admired and praised by art historians beginning with Lomazzo in the sixteenth century. Today the work appears somewhat laboured, the figures anatomically and physiognomically overdone, and the broad composition perhaps a little vacuous. One can, of course, still admire the technique and the masterly use of light, which defines the forms and gives them a silvery cast

17800-704goya.jpg	This prison scene is related in style and character to a number of small paintings of war scenes and other subjects inspired by the Napoleonic invasion. Prisoners - not only prisoners of war - are among the victims of injustice and cruelty that figure in many of Goya's drawings and engravings. A garroted man is the subject of one of his earliest etchings and various other forms of punishment and torture are represented in later graphic works. Three etchings of about 1815 show chained and shackled prisoners very similar to those in the painting. This prison scene, executed with a minimum of colour, is remarkable for the atmosphere of gloom and the effect of anonymous suffering created by the lightly painted, indistinct figures in an enormous cavern-like setting.Comparison with The Yard of a Madhouse lead critics to date this painting as early as 1793-94

08753-colonna.jpg	The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).The most important room in the palace is the gallery (Grande Galleria) on the second floor of the south wing. It is more than a story and a half in height, and it receives light from both sides. It has two separate anterooms, marked off from the main space by pairs of columns. These extensions and the wall arrangements of the room with large pilasters produced the most magnificent secular space from the Roman Baroque.The painting of the gallery was begun in 1665 and lasted until 1685. The pictorial program unfolds in the vaults of the trio of rooms and it is supplemented to this day with the original statues, paintings, and elaborate furnishings. The paintings of the two anterooms (Sala Inferiore at the west and Sala Superiore at the east) was commissioned after 1689 by Filippo I Colonna, the oldest son of Lorenzo Onofrio. The west anteroom was painted by the young Sebastiano Ricci in 1693-95 with the Allegory of Marcantonio Colonna's Victory at Lepanto. In the east anteroom Giuseppe Bartolomeo Chiari painted in 1698-1700. the Apotheosis of Marcantonio Colonna.Chiari chose to stage Colonna's apotheosis not as a dramatic spectacle, but rather as a dignified, measured scene following the conventions of solemn ceremonial

31237-montefe5.jpg	The Montefeltro family in Urbino was Piero's most generous patron towards 1465. The diptich with the portraits of Battista Sforza and Federico da Montefeltro can be dated at the beginning of this period. In these two relatively small panels Piero attempts a very difficult compositional construction, that had never been attempted before. Behind the profile portrait of the two rulers, which is iconographically related to the heraldic tradition of medallion portraits, the artist adds an extraordinary landscape that extends so far that its boundaries are lost in the misty distance. Yet the relationship between the landscape and the portraits in the foreground is very close, also in meaning: for the portraits, with the imposing hieratic profiles, dominate the painting just as the power of the rulers portrayed dominates over the expanse of their territories. The daringness of the composition lies in this sudden switch between such distant perspective planes.Piero's ability in rendering volumes is accompanied by his attention to detail. Through his use of light, he gives us a miniaturistic description of Sforza's jewels, of the wrinkles, moles and blemishes on Federico's olive-coloured skin

Pisanello used medival patterns in a 'modern' way, through the composition, the 'pictorial architecture' of Masolino or Masaccio, though without being familiar with their mathematical model of perspective. As a consequence, he sometimes fell back on medieval techniques.

33000-01farnes.jpg	In 1517 Agostino Chigi commissioned Raphael to decorate the ground floor loggia of the villa in which the artist had painted the Galatea a few years before. Like the Galatea and the Stufetta, this cycle reflects the cultured atmosphere which flourished in Rome under Julius II and Leo X. The frescoes represent the Story of Psyche, a myth derived from the Golden Ass of Apuleius (2nd century A. D.).According to his commission Raphael was to decorate the large entrance loggia, which communicates between the living-room and garden outside. Raphael approached the highly individual character of the space by treating the roofed building, which is in fact part of the main building, as an open pergola. He developed its structure out of the existing wall divisions, and covered them with magnificent, rampant garlands of fruit. Treating the room as a pergola, he designed the two large ceiling pictures that simulate tapestries stretched across the roof. These huge awnings were painted so ingeniously that we can see the straps holding them in place and the scalloped edges they create by stretching the material.The cycle of pictures appears only on the ceiling. Raphael designed a view out onto a brilliant blue sky, in which half-naked figures - either hovering or standing on clouds - merge into an erotically charged scene. The simulated tapestries depict two scenes: the gods deciding to subject Psyche to various tests, and Psyche holding a magnificent banquet to celebrate her acceptance into the circle of the Immortals. Both scenes were no doubt meant to impress upon guests the cultural attainments of the household. Despite a strong erotic charge, the cycle was meant as an example of virtuous womanhood.Although the preparatory drawings and the general conception of the stories are by Raphael, the bulk of the painting was carried out by his pupils, notably Giovanni da Udine (who painted the rich plant festoons of the frame) with the collaboration of Giulio Romano, Raffaellino del Colle and Gianfrancesco Penni

35252-4angel.jpg	This little work belonging to the period of maturity of the artist, who was a pupil of Andrea del Sarto, together with Pontormo.In 1605 the picture was collocated in the Tribune beside the more precious masterworks Medici family had collected. Recent studies revealed the panel to be a fragment of a larger painting including - such as other altarpieces by Rosso - the angel in the lower part of the scene. A sense of vitality and tenderness emanates from this little cherub playing a lute, probably dating to the beginning of the third decade of 16th century.

08804-woman.jpg	"Although the general quality of Petrus Christus's work is in doubt, a single painting, generally dated from the end of his active life, is convincing. It is the Portrait of a Young Girl in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin. The surface has the brilliance of porcelain and the purity of the overall effect looks forward to Vermeer. The lively expression of the girl and her oblique glance, suggesting that something or someone just outside the frame has caught her attention, contrasts with the frontal composition. The pink of her cheeks and lips introduces some warmth into the face, while the pure white and brown-black of the eyes echo the underlying tones of the wall behind her. Petrus Christus's portraits were once condescendingly described as rough-hewn and stilted. Yet this young girl is surely closer to Upton's description of her: ""a polished pearl, almost opalescent, lying on a cushion of black velvet"""
