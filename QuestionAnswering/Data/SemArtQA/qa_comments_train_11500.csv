04170-1pallav7.jpg	The villa owes its fame not only to its architecture and location, but also to a particularly extensive decorative program of frescoes on the piano nobile. The decoration extends through a vestibule, the adjoining large salon (the Salone), two symmetrically adjoining side rooms, and two loggias which at that time opened toward the south.The fresco decoration of the Salone and the loggias are attuned to each other: in the east (Loggia di Apollo), the chariot of the sun god Apollo in the ceiling fresco rides across the sky in the direction of the sunrise, while in the west (Loggia di Diana), the moon goddess Diana leads her team of horses.Above the passage from the loggias into the Salone, there are two over-door paintings. In the Loggia di Apollo, one can see at this location an argument between Apollo and Cupid. Apollo - overconfident after having killed the python with arrows - mocks the little archer. Cupid obtains his revenge and proves his superior power by enflaming the god to love with a shot from his bow.In the Loggia di Diana, the chaste Diana must protect herself against sensual longing as a lusty satyr tries to seize her. Anyone entering the Salone from the loggias is reminded by the images that even the noble Olympians were not safe from love's onslaught.The frescoes in the loggias were painted by two different artists. The Apollo and Cupid was executed by Giovan Battista Castello (called Il Bergamasco), who was also responsible for the decoration in the Salone, and Diana and Satyr by Luca Cambiaso. In the two contest scenes, the artists thus compete with each other

30884-tobias.jpg	The story is recounted in the Book of Tobit. Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight

41355-01sancta.jpg	The architect of the chapel, which was consecrated in 1279, was Cosma di Pietro Mellini. The interior is strongly influenced by Gothic architecture. The main room, which measures seven by seven metres terminates on its east side in an oblong rectangular altar room that is marked off by two porphyry columns. The walls of the chapel are clad with antique marble. Over the main room is a genuine Gothic quadripartite ribbed vault, in contrast to the altar room, which has a barrel vault with mosaics on a gold ground. The floor decoration is entirely in the Roman artistic tradition.The frescoes thus represent just part of the chapel decoration. Complemented by the lavish marble and mosaic decoration, they are restricted entirely to the upper zone. On the east wall we see the donor being presented by Peter and Paul opposite a Christ enthroned. The south wall shows the Crucifixion of St Peter opposite the Beheading of St Paul. On the west wall is the stoning of St Stephen and the Martyrdom of St Lawrence. The north wall shows the Martyrdom of St Agnes and St Nicholas Providing  the Dowry.The most striking characteristics of the paintings are the borrowings from antiquity in the decorative system and the ornamental repertoire (fans, display vases, acanthus tendrils, dolphins, and doves). Differences in the execution of the frescoes reveal the participation of several painters

21017-huygens.jpg	Thomas de Keyser lived and worked in Amsterdam and from the diary of the sitter, Constantijn Huygens, we know that Huygens was in Amsterdam between 22 February and 27 April 1627, the year on this portrait. It may well be 'my portrait painted shortly before my wedding' (which took place on 6 April 1627) about which Huygens wrote some Latin verses: he was then thirty-one. Two years earlier Huygens, who had previously been at the Dutch embassies in Venice and London, was appointed secretary to the Stadholder Prince Frederick Hendrick of Orange. Among his duties he had to advise the Prince on artistic matters and consequently Huygens is an important figure in the history of the art and architecture of the northern Netherlands in the seventeenth century. He was one of the first to recognize the talent of the young Rembrandt and gave him his most important early commission, a series of paintings of the Passion of Christ for the Prince's Noordeinde Palace in The Hague.De Keyser shows Huygens as he sits at his desk in his house in The Hague, attended by a servant bringing a message. Behind him hangs a rich tapestry with his coat of arms in the centre of the border at the top: the central panel appears to depict Saint Francis before the Sultan. Above the mantelpiece is a marine painting in the style of Jan Porcellis, whom Huygens admired. On the table is a long-necked lute or chitarrone, referring to his interest in music, as well as books and architectural drawings. (He was a close friend of the great classical Dutch architect, Pieter Post, and with Post's help designed his own house in The Hague). The globes which can be seen beyond the table, indicate his interest in geography and astronomy. Huygens served successive Princes of Orange: he was first councillor and reekenmeester to the Stadholder-King William III until his death in The Hague in 1687

36929-madonna.jpg	The Italo-Gothic style, which arose in Catalonia during the second quarter of the fourteenth century, is characterized by balanced forms and grave mannerism. Figures are painted against monochrome or gold backgrounds in a formula that barely hints at a third dimension. The style was introduced by Ferrer Bassa of Barcelona, a miniaturist and painter in the service of Alfonso IV and Pedro IV of Aragon. His known works cover the period from 1324 to his death in 1348. Most important are the murals of St Michael's Chapel in the monastery of Pedralbes (Barcelona). Though clearly in the Gothic tradition, he departs from earlier practice by placing greater emphasis on the distribution of masses than on the play of lines. The rythm that animates his forms is slow and restrained.Bassa's style was fully developed by his own son, Arnaldo, and by Ramon Destorrents. Italo-Gothic was popularized by the Serra brothers, Jaume and Pere, who dominated the Barcelona school during the second half of the fourteenth century. Working singly or together, they executed many fine retables, placing their somewhat shallow but not ungraceful lyricism at the service of the Gothic narrative. One of their nephews, Francisco Serra, established himself in Valencia, bringing with him the family style.On this Madonna of Serra the influence of the Sienese masters is obvious, however, the Serra brothers learnt this style not in Siena but in Avignon where the Papal Court was the most important northern centre of the late Gothic Italian painting

The present painting depicting Matthijs Pompe van Slingelandt (1621-1679) and his family is typical of Mijtens's classical period in the mid-1650s and clearly reveals the influence of Van Dyck's highly influential portrait style, especially in the skilful treatment of the expensive fabrics of the clothes and the elegant poses and gestures.The wealthy Matthijs Pompe van Slingelandt came from Dordrecht where he later became a councillor and alderman.

22513-crucdisp.jpg	This fresco depicts the two last episodes from the story of the life of Peter: to the right we see him, with St Paul, in his dispute with Simon Magus in front of the Emperor; to the left, his Crucifixion.Recently it was suggested that Masaccio had originally painted the last scene of the cycle, the Crucifixion of Peter. But that fresco was then destroyed when the Madonna del Popolo was placed on the altar, so that when Filippino was called in to complete the unfinished cycle and repair the damaged sections, he was also asked to add the scene of the death of Peter on the empty wall space.Among the portraits Filippino has included in his fresco, the most interesting are the following: a selfportrait (the first figure to the left, looking towards the spectator); the first man to the right of the three men standing between St Peter and Nero is Antonio del Pollaiolo, while the one to the left is probably Raggio, a merchant's broker mentioned by Vasari, and not Botticelli as had been suggested previously; whereas in the group of three to the right in the Crucifixion of Peter, the man looking towards the audience is probably Botticelli

05534-52lemmi.jpg	The only secular frescoes by Botticelli that still exist were discovered 1873, in the Villa Lemmi, at the foot of the Careggi Hill, close to a villa of Cosimo de Medici. They had been concealed under old coats of paint for centuries. Villa Lemmi belonged to the Tornabuoni family, friend of the Medici. It is supposed the frescoes were executed to commemorate the marriage of Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi.The frescoes are in a very poor state of preservation, because they were damaged when taken down from the wall. Two of the three fragments found were transferred to canvas and later sold to the Louvre in Paris. The two compositions were originally separated only by a window.One of the fragments probably  represents Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman, the other A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts.Even in this poor condition, the two frescoes still have some of the elegance which is the feature of Botticelli's best compositions. The fact that the figures cannot be entirely identified in no way detracts from their distant charm. It is, however, assumed that this is an allegorical celebration for a newly married couple. Even though the young man is obviously being led towards the female allegories of the seven liberal arts, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, grammar, geometry, astronomy and music, it is unclear who is leading him there

23562-christ_b.jpg	Born in Dordrecht, Maes went to Amsterdam in about 1650 to study with Rembrandt. He was back in his native city by 1653 and stayed until 1673, when he returned to settle in Amsterdam. By 1654 he had abandoned Rembrandt's way of painting in favour of small domestic interiors depicting the life of women and children. They differ from similar subjects painted by de Hooch in their extensive use of glossy black and warm reds, and the strong contrasts between light and dark, but some share de Hooch's interest in views into another room or space - although we don't know of any direct connection between the two painters. From 1660 Maes confined himself to portraiture, in time adopting the elegant French style favoured in Holland in the latter part of the century.The attribution of this huge picture has been the subject of much debate, but it is now generally accepted as an early work by Maes painted either during his time in Rembrandt's studio or just after. One of his two surviving preparatory compositional sketches is loosely based on Rembrandt's famous Hundred Guilder Print. Both works illustrate a passage from the Gospel of Saint Matthew: 'Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven' (19:13-14).In Maes's picture dark browns and blacks are enlivened with touches of cream and red - most striking in the cheeks of the little girl on whom Jesus has 'put his hands' and who turns around shyly and uncomprehendingly, finger in mouth. Her school slate hangs at her side - for these are seventeenth-century Dutch mothers and children who crowd around Jesus, although he, like Saint Peter standing rebuked behind the tree and the man lifting up the child (a disciple removing an infant, or a father jumping the queue?), is wearing 'timeless' dress. The young man awkwardly squeezed in at the left is likely to be a self portrait, a reminder that this picture is dated to Maes's late 'teens. He has followed all the precepts for monumental narrative painting - the full-length figures on the scale of life, a significant and elevated biblical story, the poses and emotions of all the figures carefully delineated, the lights and darks disposed so as to highlight Jesus and the children - yet something genre-like and sentimental keeps breaking through. Whether because most patrons with space on their walls for a canvas of this size wanted something loftier than the homely figures depicted here, or whether Maes himself realised that 'history painting' was not what he wished to do, he was never again to attempt a picture on this ambitious scale

22711-1forest.jpg	This painting was made for the chapel of the Medici (later Medici-Riccardi) which decorated by Benozzo Gozzoli. It does not just depict the Adoration of the Child, it also shows the Holy Trinity. God the Father, the Holy Spirit and Christ are united on the painting and represent the conception of the Holy Trinity held by the Western Church: the Holy Spirit emanates from the Father and Son. This contrasts with the view held by the Orthodox Church, in which the Holy Spirit emanates from God the Father alone. The picture reflects the debate on general principles that took place between the Orthodox and Western Churches at the Council of Ferrara-Florence in 1439

32738-absinth.jpg	Raffa&#235;lli was a painter of suburban scenes which were sometimes pessimistic and sometimes rather tender. Essentially self-taught, he essayed various thematic areas, and alternated between the Salon and other exhibition strategies. His contact with the Impressionists was merely loose, and consisted partly in a shared interest in social fringe groups. At first he painted Breton peasants, the urban alcoholics and rag-and-bone collectors. He also shared the Impressionists' concern with the persuasive atmospherics of sketchy pictorial spatial contexts.The Absinth Drinkers, a semi-lifesize canvas exhibited in 1881 as The Down and Outs, would have appealed to Degas for the canvas structure and the subject of the lonely outsiders, but also the delicately nuanced colouring

It is not always clear, however, whether a particular work was painted by Bruges masters who had settled in Antwerp or in Bruges itself.

18851-arcadia.jpg	"This is one of Guercino's best-known paintings. It shows two young shepherds who have discovered a skull. The title could be interpreted as a sentence uttered by Death (""I too am in Arcadia""). But any moral significance to the work is lost in a moment of pure contemplation. Quotations from Correggio and Venetian art are completely in tune with the depth and sensitivity of feeling typical of Guercino.This painting is directly connected to the Apollo and Marsyas that Guercino carried out for the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1618 (Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence): both pictures include the same group of shepherds. It is assumed that the Barberini canvas could not have existed as an independent composition prior to the Florentine painting, and so must have been executed later. In this painting, Guercino transforms the rustic onlookers into protagonists in a self-sufficient moralizing theme. An effective exploration of the memento mori is attained by the addition of the skull, with its worm and fly, and the inscription Et in Arcadia ego. An early work of Guercino, the painting was executed before his Roman period (1621-23) and after his voyage to Venice, where this sort of moralizing allegory was quite popular. The canvas has been dated alternately to 1618 and 1622.The iconography of the memento mori in a pastoral setting, derived from the Ecologues of Virgil, was well known in Venetian and Roman art from the Renaissance onwards; yet here for the first time it is explicitly explained through the addition of the inscription."

06619-flowers3.jpg	Unlike Bosschaert, Brueghel did not use landscapes as a background. Rather, protruding upwards from a flower pot, his myriads of flowers are set against a pitch-dark background, so that the contrast gives them a luminous quality. While Bosschaert preferred more cultivated flowers - rather costly at the time - and only depicted a few flowers of the fields and meadows among them, it is precisely these delicate plants that gave Brueghel the idea for 'tapestry' of flowers. Indeed, there is such an abundance of different species that they often defeat identification - over 130 kinds have been counted up to now. It is indeed a tapestry, as all the blossoms seem to crowd towards the front, just as in a two-dimensional space

03412-05adorat.jpg	The Adoration of the Shepherds is an imposing composition dating from around 1544-45 and the time of the artists early maturity. It was during this decade that Bassano painted a number of successful works on a large scale, which helped to establish him as a major artist of the Venetian school.The main compositional features of this painting are the treatment of the architecture, the Virgin's expression of concern for the Child, and the figure of the shepherd who acknowledges the Holy Family by removing his headgear. These features appear to be derived from a painting of the same subject by Titian, the original of which was painted for the Duke of Urbino in 1532-34 and may be the ruined panel in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence. Bassano clearly knew of Titian's painting, but almost certainly through the woodcut by the Master I.B. (Giovanni Boitto), which he seems to have made use of in the 1530s. The composition follows the same direction as the print, which reverses Titian's painting. It is notable that Bassano often redeployed figures in his paintings so that the figure of Joseph in the present work is found in reverse in the Rest on the Flight into Egypt and the kneeling shepherd in the foreground is used in reverse in the Adoration of the Magi. Apparently, from quite an early date, the artist kept a stock of drawings in his studio for this purpose.Apart from Titian, other influences have been cited in the context of Bassano's composition. The architectural features and the shepherd playing the bagpipes recall the woodcut of the Nativity in D�rer's Little Passion of 1511. On a general basis the naturalistic aspects of the composition are often compared with Netherlandish painting, particularly the work of artists such as Pieter Aertsen. Such observations perhaps over-emphasise the eclectic elements in Bassano's art when it is preferable to stress the scale of the work, the firm drawing, the warm colouring and the view of the artist's home town of Bassano del Grappa, seen in the background against the mountains. Iconographically, the broken elements of the classical architecture denote the passing of the Old Law in favour of the New Law symbolised by the Christ Child. Similarly, the tree prefigures the death of Christ on the cross

03773-060agon.jpg	This early work of Bellini is fundamental for measuring the relationship that existed between the two brothers-in-law, Giovanni Bellini and Andrea Mantegna. A fairly strong resemblance links this work with the analogous subject painted by Mantegna in 1459, possibly for Giacomo Marcello, now also at the National Gallery in London. Indeed, both works were for long considered to be by Mantegna. The atmosphere is leaden and rarefied, and the harsh, barren landscape retains some of the strong elemental emotions of the primitives (in fact much of the setting is drawn from an idea of Jacopo's, exemplified by a sketch from his London notebook); the scene has a motionless essentiality. However, beyond the highly forced lines (still not even approaching the urgency of Mantegna's style) the dramatic way in which the two painters approach the subject is different: Mantegna's harsh and embossed in the dark contrast of strong colours; Bellini's more subtly lyrical and humanly resigned

35098-window1.jpg	This view was painted from the drawing-room window of the painter's childhood home.During the Romantic era, open windows and ships on the sea became popular themes with symbolic undertones. On the windowsill, flowers in different stages of growth reflect the stages of human life. Out in the harbour the flowers are matched by three warships: the middle ship is still under construction, the right one has no rigging, leaving only the ship on the left seaworthy.For many Romantics, their chosen image of creative Genius was the plant, germinating from its seed in its own cycle of life. It obeyed natural law, and could be stunted only by outside intervention. In this painting plants themselves create a portrait of the painter. On a windowsill overlooking Copenhagen harbour stands an array of pots whose contents represent both his life and his art - an unsprouted seed, a protected cutting, a young agave, a flourishing hydrangea and a withered amaranth - together with casts of a child's and an adult's foot, and a sketchbook whose pages are waiting to be filled. A captive bird hangs in its cage above, doubtless yearning for its freedom. A mirror in the window is placed too high to reflect the artist, but his presence is everywhere in the work's symbolic programme

02954-rocca1.jpg	The decoration of this room represents depictions of the history of the Rossi family from 1199 to to 1542. It is the work of Cesare Baglione, Jacopo Bertoia, and others.The decoration of large halls with the deeds of the nobility and their ancestors was intended to inspire the viewer's admiration. The depiction of such events from the recent past has a long tradition. Most such cycles in the first half of the sixteenth century, however, are dedicated to a single person or event. By contrast, from the middle of the century onward this genre was increasingly devoted to the representation of dynasties.Pragmatic reasons were behind the success of the idea, derived from Raphael and his workshop, of making mural painting that simulated tapestries. Sometimes the possibility of pulling the tapestries aside was used to integrate doors or windows into the decoration. The popularity of the tapestry motif was not based solely on formal concerns, however. It imitated the most splendid and expensive wall decoration of all, which cost many times more than a fresco painting and could be afforded by very few. Hence, particularly in large halls like those in San Secondo, this motif also contributed to their significance and emphasized the importance of the thing depicted - in this case the deeds of the family in question

05445-10adorat.jpg	The Adoration of the Magi demonstrates Botticelli's continued progression in his handling of this subject. The main event is no longer located to one side, as was the case in the earlier painting, but has been moved into the centre of the picture. In portraying such a detailed wealth of variation, Botticelli was following Leon Battista Alberti, the artist and scholar, who had recommended in his treatise on painting that a picture be so executed as to embrace the greatest possible diversity, for the edification of the observer. Botticelli thus not only painted his figures clothed in highly imaginative robes such as present a wealth of variation, but also captured them in the most varied of postures, gestures and facial expressions. The relationship between the various figures here, and between these figures and the action that is taking place, also appears tighter than in the earlier Adoration, nevertheless, they still do not yet constitute a dramatic unity.There is such a wealth of figures in this composition that the overall effect can seem quite confusing, but in the centre is the child sitting on Mary's lap. The scene is a ruined, pseudoclassical temple building. It was considered to be the symbol of the destruction of the heathen world by Christ's arrival, for according to mediaeval legend an ancient temple of peace collapsed in Rome when Christ was born.

Today they are mounted as a triptych in the Uffizi with The Adoration of the Magi in the centre.

24817-christop.jpg	Placed in a panoramic landscape St Christopher has an imposing stature and his marked features are very coarse. He is wearing a turban and a red cloak over a blue tunic. Of particular note is the saint's hunched position, emphasising his gigantism. The Child appears to be firmly installed on his shoulder and the softness of his complexion contrasts with the giant's tanned skin. Finally, the hermit who told the saint of his noble vocation can be seen at the mouth of a cave. The river leads our gaze to the background where we can perceive beautiful examples of Gothic architecture.Purchased from an Austrian collection in 1919 by a Jewish antiquarian, Otto Mayer (1875-1964), this painting was confiscated by the Gestapo in Berlin in October 1933.

35710-kostverl.jpg	"According to tradition, Kostverloren manor was built around 1500 south of Amsterdam on a bend in the Amstel river. Kostverlore (""lost cost"") owed its name to the large sums needed to prop up the manor as it sank in the marshy ground on the banks of the Amstel. It was built possibly as an extension to an extant donjon. Parts of the building were demolished between 1659 and 1664, whereupon the house was rebuilt.

19504-crucifi.jpg	This work illustrate the influence exerted in the Low Countries by the Italian Renaissance. A variety of artists made the journey to Italy in the 16th century, where they absorbed the new artistic ideas. Their work brought an entirely new approach to religious painting compared to the pious, inward-looking art of the 15th century. Novel elements included brilliant compositions and above all the heightened attention to the human body - a focus that led to frequent exaggeration.Many of the paintings produced by the Haarlem artist Maerten van Heemskerck, who spent the years 1532-35 in Italy, stand out for their somewhat contrived poses and their element of theatricality. His Crucifixion, with its atmosphere of torment, heightened by the use of colour is a striking example of the Mannerist approach.The painting is signed and dated bottom left: M. HEMSKERCK /fecit/ 1543.

34153-delme.jpg	English portrait painting after 1750 moved in the direction of naturalness. Sir Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough - exact contemporaries - were the two greatest English portrait painters of the eighteenth century, but their pictures were of quite different types. Reynolds was a temperamental painter who loved to yield to the excitement of actual painting. For all that, he was acutely concerned over all questions of technique, and throughout his life he studied the pictures of the masters, especially of Rembrandt and Rubens, in an effort to penetrate their secret. In the Baroque manner he painted his figures in the action and attitude best fitted to the sitter's character. When his sitters were women, he approached the sensuousness of Rubens

08711-melancho.jpg	The toll of young men in the French Revolution, and in the ensuing wars, was immense. While loss afflicted both sexes and all ages, its consequences for women were more practical. Survival and responsibility created new opportunities. While women artists were not a new phenomenon, it was women artists in Paris &#151; some of them associated with David - who found the means to project the grief of an abandoned generation in terms of poetic allegory. But far from asserting independence, their pictures tended to reinforce male stereotypes of female attachment. Epitomized by Melancholy by Constance Charpentier, which appeared in the Salon of 1801 and showed a girl seated alone and despondent in a woody landscape, meditating on her lost loved one, these soulful and sentimental images conveyed a passive devotion. These women seem to have nothing to do but remember; time and emotion are frozen for them.

44376-set_hunt.jpg	Hunting was one of the favourite pastimes of the country nobility during the seventeenth century. Elegant hunting scenes appealed to aristocratic art collectors who were able to identify with them and saw their rank and prestige reflected in them. With a number of variations in subject matter, it was possible to cater for a great diversity of tastes. Setting Out on the Hunt, and its pendant, also in Dresden, number among Wouwerman's later works. They date from a period in which his attention was chiefly devoted to hunting scenes. Indeed, about two hundred paintings on this theme are known from his hand.In this painting the horses have been saddled and the hounds are waiting in front of a grand country house for the chase to begin. The scene is aristocratic in character, as can be seen not only from the noble villa, but also from the sculptures adorning the buildings, the Baroque fountain, and the elegance of the hunting party. Wouwerman introduces a touch of genre painting into the work by placing a mother with two children squatting on the ground and a beggar asking for alms to the left of the picture.The elegant subject matter, the expansive southern landscape, the horses caught most faithfully in their movements, the depictions of figures with loving attention to detail, and the sensitive use of colour are all typical of Wouwerman's late period

07533-30conver.jpg	In 1600 Caravaggio received the commission for two paintings on cypress panel, one (Conversion of St Paul) for the new chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo. The extant painting with the subject is on canvas. The version in the Odeschalci Balbi Collection is on cypress wood as stipulated in the contract of 1600. It is probably a copy therefore it can be assumed that there was one time an original by Caravaggio.In the position of the St Paul and of the Christ, and in the movement of the horse into the depth of the picture, this work is still related to the tradition of Michelangelo's fresco in the Paolina Chapel. There are decidedly Caravaggesque elements in the work, such as the face of the angel supporting Christ, which greatly resembles that of the Amor Victorious (Berlin), or of the Isaac in the Sacrifice of Isaac (Uffizi)

28854-portr_m.jpg	This work is one of Moretto's comparatively rare aristocratic portraits. Although influenced by German pictures in its early adoption of the full-length life-size format popularised by Cranach and adopted by Holbein, it is more indebted to Venetian painting. Moretto was said to have studied with Titian, and must have known the poetic works of Giorgione. He was certainly also aware of Lotto, who worked for a while in nearby Bergamo. The painting owes something to all of them, notably in its sitter's melancholy expression as he gazes abstractedly beyond the marble loggia of a Renaissance villa. He may have been a member of the Avogadro family of Brescia, for the portrait comes from the palace of direct descendants. Genealogical research suggests that he was Gerolamo II Avogadro, the father of Moroni's 'Knight of the Wounded Foot'

02886-bernini.jpg	This painting has been connected to a drawing at Windsor dated 1665, evidence which led to date the painting to that year. The preparatory design for the portrait is a drawing at the Palazzo Bianco in Genoa: a drawing derived from it is conserved at Weimar.First considered a self-portrait of Bernini, the painting was only later given to Baciccio. Gaulli carried out several other portraits of Bernini, his teacher and friend. One example, coming from the Altieri collection, dates to around 1673. Another version, once belonging to Queen Christina of Sweden, was in the Geymuller collection. The first Gaulli portrait of Bernini was executed some time before Christmas, 1669, as it is mentioned in a dated letter from Rangoni to the Duke of Modena

36891-s_louis1.jpg	In Mantua, the Gonzaga family marked their rapid ascent to prominence by commissioning in the church of San Francesco a large funerary chapel. The church was largely destroyed during World War II but fortunately the Gonzaga chapel survived.The Gonzaga chapel is the largest of the church's noble chapels, occupying the most prestigious location close to the apse. Here the bodies of princes and their consorts reposed in marble tombs - now largely removed - among brilliantly coloured frescoes that covered the chapel's vault and walls. Although only partially preserved, these paintings still give an idea of the extravagant visions of both patron and painter in realizing this commission. The artist, who illustrated scenes from the lives of Christ and St Louis of Toulouse, was the Modenese painter Serafino Serafini, a pupil of the more famous Tommaso da Modena

26729-lu13naa.jpg	"""Amminadab begat Nahshon. Nahshon begat Salmon."" (Matthew 1:4)The two lunettes at the ends of the side walls near the altar contain only two figures: a man, to whom the name inscribed on the tablet refers, and a woman. For the first time, in the Nahshon lunette, the two figures - seen alone and in profile - face in the same direction, without any concern for symmetry.The same orientation was employed for the principal figures in the lost Abraham-Jacob-Isaac-Judas lunette. The woman is depicted standing, with one foot resting on the stone seat, looking at herself in an oval mirror that she is holding in her hand, her elbow resting on the knee of her raised leg. Her back and head are bent forward, following the curve of the top edge of the lunette. She is wearing a green overdress, tied over the shoulders, and a rose blouse with rose-orange shadows. The complex style of her blond hair, knotted on the top of her head, from where a long ponytail hangs, emphasizes her clean-cut profile and the delicate passages of light and shade on her neck, on which a gold earring stands out. The pose of the woman is probably derived from a relief representing the muse Melpomene on a Roman sarcophagus.On the other side of the lunette, a youthful Nahshon, sits leaning back on the edge of the tablet, engrossed in reading the book open in front of him. His outstretched right leg rests on the wooden pedestal of the lectern holding the book, while the other one is bent, and his arms are folded. He is enveloped in an ample red mantle with gray-blue shadows and green lining and hood. The elegant nonchalance of the pose is well matched by the expression on his face - in shadow and framed by blond curls - which is that of a slightly sulky adolescent prince"

08833-eccehomo.jpg	The history of what is certainly Cigoli's most famous painting has recently been clarified by the discovery of new documents. Cigoli's nephew, Giovanni Battista Cardi, was the first to report that this Ecce Homo was chosen as the best of three versions of the theme commissioned as part of an 'unknown' competition between Cigoli, Caravaggio and Domenico Passignano. It is now clear that in 1607, when Cigoli was resident in Rome, he painted an Ecce Homo for Massimo Massimi as a pendant for a picture by Caravaggio that the collector already owned. Although Cigoli's contract does not specify the subject of Caravaggio's picture, it was most likely The Crowning with Thorns commissioned by Massimi two years earlier and that has been identified by some scholars as the painting now in Prato. A thumbnail sketch at the bottom of Cigoli's preparatory drawing depicts a Crowning with Thorns that may reflect Massimi's Caravaggio. The drawing also illustrates Cigoli's attempt to bring his own more lyrical style into harmony with Caravaggio's particular brand of dramatic naturalism. He adopts a 'Caravaggesque' illumination, in which the three principal figures are brilliantly lit from the front while the soldiers behind them are almost absorbed by the inky darkness of the background. In the painting Christ's suffering is depicted with a subtle degree of realism, although the servant's facial features are grotesquely exaggerated in keeping with the traditional manner of depicting the subject. This is precisely the type of caricaturing that is dropped in the Ecce Homo attributed to Caravaggio, where the servant is rendered with the same naturalism as Christ

26332-hunter_g.jpg	The subject of this painting, a young woman sewing who entertains a hunter proffering a dead partridge, constitutes a male&#151;female confrontation that lies at the heart of much of Metsu's imagery throughout his career. Cleverly, the artist has even introduced a contrast between the protagonists' dogs: the lady's lapdog poised on the table stares at the stocky spaniel standing faithfully by its masters side.Clearly, the little statue of Cupid perched on the linen chest behind the hunter and seamstress emphasizes the amorous nature of his offer, but the lustful underpinnings of the hunter's gesture would have been readily apparent to seventeenth-century viewers. In contemporary Dutch prints and texts birds refer to lasciviousness and the Dutch verb 'vogelen' (to bird) to sexual intercourse. Thus by offering the bird to the young woman, Metsu's hunter is actually propositioning her

30680-flowers1.jpg	P�rez Sierra's flower paintings were appreciated by some of the most distinguished collectors of his time, including the king himself. On the death of Charles II, the 1700 inventory of the Buen Retiro palace mentioned a series of six flower pieces by his hand, of which four are known today, the painting shown here is one of them. These works show the distinctive personality of this artist in the genre. Their low viewpoint endows the flower pieces with a degree of monumentality and reflects the fact that they were conceived for display over windows or doors, or another such high point on a wall.

43994-2bladel.jpg	"The centre of the triptych shows the Nativity of Christ. The donor wore clothes of a similar fashion to those occurring in Rogier's miniature in the Hainault Chronicle. Apart from the fact that the donor's coat is not made of costly brocade, it greatly resembles the one worn by the duke in the miniature. Unlike Philip, who as the highest-ranking person present keeps on his hat, the ""chaperon,"" the donor in the triptych, kneeling before the Christ Child, has removed his, and wears it slung behind him on his back.The donor of the Middleburg Altarpiece is more closely integrated with the scene than in almost any other Early Netherlandish painting. In his position and attitude he takes the place, within the Nativity narrative, of a shepherd praying, a motif frequent in pictorial tradition. Even in Rogier's Crucifixion Triptych (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), the married couple who commissioned the work are much more obviously outside the events shown, because their attitude of prayer cannot be seen as part of the narrative. But the donor of the Middelburg Altarpiece too is present only in spirit, witnessing the incarnation of God in his meditations. In order to put sufficient distance between him and the Virgin, the artist has resorted to a device already found in the Deposition (Prado, Madrid): the contours of his figure come very close to other items in the pictorial area, but overlap them to a minimal extent. The donor's head comes short of the ruined wall confining the area containing the Virgin, his hands are close to the outline of her dress but do not quite touch it, and the outline of his coat runs past Mary's robe with only a very slight overlap. The man is kept within a vertical area of the painting (an effect reinforced by the black he wears), an area also containing the fine town with its worldly bustle that is his real environment, although here, of course, it represents Bethlehem. The gap in the little wall behind the donor on the right denotes the road he has taken away from everyday life in his piety, an idea also suggested by the end of his head-dress lying on the ground.A carefully calculated equilibrium is perceptible in the composition. There are three large figures on each panel - even the left-hand panel, where the emperor's two advisers at the back are in fact almost hidden by the one in front. The group around the Christ Child describes an upward-pointing triangle, balanced by a downward-pointing triangle created by the outline of the diagonally placed ruin and the two holes in the foreground, which are set on a slant. This surface pattern in the shape of a horizontal rhomboid, however, also creates depth, since the corner of the ruin projecting forward and the figures graduated in a sequence moving backward interlock spatially. But as usual, Rogier restricts the back part of the stage on which his main figures are set: the back wall of the ruin, the wall of Octavian's apartment, and the hill behind the Magi all act as visual barriers at about the same depth.The main purpose of the triangular composition, however, is to emphasize the Virgin Mary, particularly since she is placed approximately on the central axis of the picture. This position might seem natural, but is in fact unusual in depictions of the Nativity, where Mary is generally placed to one side, next to the Child. The dark wall also acts as a contrasting background and forms a kind of baldachin over Mary. This manner of depicting the Virgin was another of Rogier's successful ideas, imitated by many other artists"

13725-junoargu.jpg	The subject of the painting is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Io, the beautiful daughter of the river god Inachus, fell prey to the passion of Jupiter, who - in order to hide her from his jealous wife - turned the girl into a cow. The wily Juno talked her husband into giving her the fine-looking animal and had the hundred-eyed Argus guard it. Jupiter gave Mercury the task of killing the wicked guard. The inventive god approached the meadows and played songs on his pipe. The guard was charmed by the new and masterful melodies, and was lulled to sleep. Mercury beheads the sleeping guardian.The vigour of the composition arranged on a diagonal, the lightness of the figure of Juno, recumbent on a cloud, and of her wind-blown draperies, the contrast of their bright, vivid colours with the muted tones of the rest of the picture, are characteristic of the artist's manner, which foreshadows eighteenth-century Rococo art

19915-02george.jpg	At the other end of the spectrum of portraiture from the blatant display of regal power in Henry VIII's portrait (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid), is the aesthetic delicacy and reverie of this circular portrait. It is also Holbein's only profile portrait. A minor court figure, Simon George sports a fashionable hat similar to the King's, a hat whose circularity echoes that of the work itself.Holbein had avoided the profile hitherto in England since it reduced the scope for his sharp yet reticent portrayal of personality. After Holbein's death, this format became popular for a while among his followers, perhaps for the very reason that it made a less searching examination of their ability to express psychological nuance.The humour in the eyes and some inscrutable edge of a smile about the mouth is remarkably conveyed here, although these qualities had been lacking in the blunt preliminary drawing.The carnation held by the sitter in his right hand is a reference to an engagement or marriage. The identification with Simon George is based on an inscription on the relevant portrait study in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle, which notes that Simon comes from Cornwall. Otherwise little is known about him

20041-03christ.jpg	Honthorst, like Ter Brugghen, was a pupil of the history painter Abraham Bloemaert in Utrecht and also went to Rome. Unlike Ter Brugghen, however, he there achieved an international reputation, working for nobles and princes of the Church. The Italians called him Gherardo delle Notti, - Gerard of the Nocturnes - and this painting, made for the Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani in whose palace Honthorst stayed, explains why. On his return north of the Alps Honthorst was so famous that he was invited to England by Charles I, for whom he painted mythological subjects and many portraits. He continued to receive commissions from royalty in Holland, executing portraits and allegorical decorations for Prince Frederik Hendrik of Orange, and in 1635 he sent the first of a long series of historical and mythological narratives to Christian IV of Denmark. The exiled Queen of Bohemia, Elisabeth Stuart and her daughters were among  his many pupils in The Hague.Where Ter Brugghen in the Concert uses candlelight to create a scene of dreamlike enchantment, Honthorst employ it to lend veracity and dramatic tension to a biblical story (Matthew 26:57-64). After his capture on the night of the Agony in the Garden, Jesus is taken for interrogation and trial before the High Priest Caiaphas, where two false witnesses - the shifty-looking men behind Caiaphas - speak against him. Within the vast composition - in scale and format like an altarpiece but never intended for one - the visibility of the life-size figures depends entirely on that single candle flame. Its gleam unifies the whole, by giving the impression of illuminating the entire room with evenly decreasing intensity until its force is spent in the dark, and by justifying the reddish cast of all the colours. It allows the two principal characters to stand out more solidly in relief and in greater detail than the others. It focuses attention on their poses, gestures and expressions. It picks out the few significant accessories, notably the books of the Law and the rope by which Christ is tied, and it creates the solemn and threatening atmosphere of a night-time interrogation.Through his mastery of the physical effects of illumination from a single source, Honthorst is also able to make symbolic points. Christ's white robe, torn from his shoulder when he was made prisoner, reflects more light than the priest's furred cloak - so that light seems to radiate from him. Though submissive, Christ is without question the main subject of the painting, the Light of the World and the Son of God

35302-eibsee.jpg	When Carl Rottmann came from Heidelberg to Munich in 1811, he saw Joseph Anton Koch's paintings in the Neue Pinakothek. It turned out to be a crucial experience. Beginning from such models, Rottmann developed a unique landscape style that made him one of the major German landscapists of the nineteenth century.Intimations of this are already seen in his painting of the Eibsee. By means of sweeping horizontals, Rottmann evokes the majesty and sublimity of the mountains, emphasizing them all the more by contrast with the tiny figure on the outcrop in the left foreground. Otherwise the scene shows no trace of human presence or habitation. Water, rocks, and sky speak with their own voice, underscoring their wild, primeval character

11655-1valle1.jpg	The picture shows the paintings in the choir of Sant'Andrea della Valle: Scenes from the Life of St Andrew by Domenichino in the apse calotte; Scenes from the Martyrdom of St Andrew by Mattia Preti on the choir walls.Sant'Andrea della Valle is the general seat for the religious order of the Theatines. Its construction started 1593 under the designs of Giacomo della Porta and Pier Paolo Olivieri, and under the patronage of Cardinal Gesualdo. With the prior patron's death, direction of the church passed to Cardinal Alessandro Peretti di Montalto, nephew of Sixtus V. By 1608, work restarted anew with a more grandiose plan, mainly by Carlo Maderno. The interior structure of the church was finally completed by 1666, with additional touches added by Francesco Grimaldi (1560-after 1626). The Baroque fa�ade was added between 1655 and 1663 by Carlo Rainaldi, at the expense of Cardinal Francesco Peretti di Montalto, nephew of Alessandro.One of the greatest challenges to confront Roman religious painting in the first half of the seventeenth century was the decoration of the Sant'Andrea della Valle. The structure of the church competed architecturally and in its urban setting with the two most important sixteenth-century Roman religious structures, namely Saint Peter's, with its similar tall drum cupola visible from afar, and Il Ges&#249;, which provided the pattern for its longitudinal structure flanked by chapels. With the painting of choir and the cupola of Sant'Andrea these prototypes were outdone, for at that time neither Saint Peter's nor Il Ges&#249; had any high-quality painted decoration. Accordingly, Sant'Andrea della Valle set a new standard, and introduced an epoch of Roman monumental painting that would culminate a half-century later in two simultaneous Jesuit commissions (in Sant'Ignazio di Loyola).Domenichino was commissioned in 1622 to paint the choir. Originally he was supposed to take over the entire painted decoration of the church, however, the commission for the cupola was given to Giovanni Lanfranco instead. This led to a breach between the two former workshop assistants of Annibale Carracci. Both Domenichino's pictures in the choir calotte and Lanfranco's cupola were completed in 1628.Mattia Preti was commissioned in 1650 to paint the nave of the church. The commission included four pictures in the nave vault and the compartments above the windows. Additional contracts in the same year obliged the painter the paint three scenes from the life of St Andrew on the wall of the choir, and pictures on the wall of the antechoir. The paintings on the nave vault were not realised

38262-luteplay.jpg	The lute is a plucked string instrument with a fretted neck and a deep round back. The origins of the lute are obscure. Various types of lutes were in use in ancient cultures. The most important point of transfer of the lute from Muslim to Christian European culture might have been in Sicily, where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Saracen musicians. Over the course of the Baroque era the lute was increasingly relegated to the continuo accompaniment, and was eventually superseded in that role by keyboard instruments. The lute fell out of use after 1800.

While the broad frozen river stretching out to the horizon is reminiscent of Avercamp's compositions, Van der Neer chooses a lower viewpoint and reduces the number of figures, allowing our eyes to more comfortably follow the banks of the river as they appear to recede in the distance

33596-01group.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 403.Rembrandt began to work as a professional portraitist about 1631. His earliest existing commissioned portraits (Portrait of a Scholar, The Hermitage, St. Petersburg; Portrait of the Amsterdam Merchant Nicholaas Ruts, Frick Collection, New York) are both of that year. The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp of 1632 shows how quickly he surpassed the smooth technique of the fashionable Amsterdam portraitists. The group portrait of Tulp, appointed 'praelector anatomiae' of Amsterdam's surgeon guild in 1628, and seven of the guild's members probably established his reputation immediately. All potential clients must have been impressed by the new vitality and pictorial richness he gave to the portraits. The picture still impresses us today by the dramatic concentration of the figures on Tulp's demonstration of the dissection of a forearm.The corpse is the focus of the composition, by its intense brightness. From here, the eye of the spectator is led to the illuminated heads of the listeners, whose expressions and attitudes reflect different degrees of attention, and to the face and hands of Tulp, who is a most convincing representation of a scholar absorbed in his subject. With forceps in his right hand Tulp holds the muscles and tendons of the arm that control the movement of the hand, while the bent fingers of his left hand demonstrate an aspect of their wondrous action. The illusionism is enhanced by the vivid characterization of the individuals as well as by the artist's great power in dramatizing the moment within a coherent group. Without the strong chiaroscuro and the fine atmospheric quality that is combined with it, the picture would lose its intensity, the sculptural quality of the forms, and all the excitement of the moment. Here, psychological and pictorial tension combine to create the feeling of an extraordinary event.The painting marked a turning point both in Rembrandt's stylistic development and in the evolution of the Dutch corporation, or guild, portrait. For the first time, the figures were unified not merely by token gestures and glances but by their common interest in an event taking place within the composition

20189-nieuwe1.jpg	His first known depiction of an actual church interior is his unexpected New Church in Delft with the Tomb of William the Silent, dated 1650, now at Hamburg. By the time it was done Saenredam had been painting pictures of identifiable churches for more than two decades; however, juxtaposition of any by Saenredam with Houckgeest's New Church shows straightaway what is novel about his painting.In Saenredam's church interiors the line of vision is always at an angle of about 90&#186; to the centre of the nave or to the wall of the building he depicts. In the Hamburg picture Houckgeest, like Saenredam, has kept the field of vision relatively high, but he had the brilliant new idea of shifting his position to the side to give an angle of about 45&#186; to the principal axis of the New Church. The new position creates intriguingly intricate diagonal views across the church. He also has considerably shortened the distance between the viewer and the closest architectural element portrayed, the massive column near the centre. Although the best-known monument in the Netherlands is subordinated to the huge pier and is partially obscured by another one, the allegorical sculptures figure of Freedom on Willem's tomb gains emphasis by the new scheme.The general tonality of the painting is light, yet there is a striking gain in contrast in the values of his colours, a pronounced change from Saenredam's delicate monochromatic mode. Bright rays of sunlight, which are never found in Saemnredam's interiors, now enter the church and relive the powerful weight of the columns. People in the church have gained emphasis too, and their clothing provides some vivid colour accents

06717-sacristy.jpg	The building of the Old Sacristy of San Lorenzo dates back to an endowment made by Giovanni Averardo de'Mdeici. The building, which was dedicated to St John, was decorated with episodes from his life, as he was Giovanni's patron saint. In 1421 Brunelleschi took on the task of directing the construction work on San Lorenzo, the Medici family church. Possibly as early as 1419, and certainly not later than 1422, work was began according to his plans on the construction of the Old Sacristy. Built on a square ground plan, the main building is one of the earliest central plan buildings of the Renaissance. Between 1434 and 1437, Brunelleschi was to follow it up Florence with Santa Maria degli Angeli, the first free-standing and pure central plan building.The Old Sacristy shows the continuation of medieval building tradition in the main walls, which serve both bearing and weatherproofing functions, while the facing elements in pietra serena (the pilaster strips, capitals, trabeation, and arch frame) are innovative in their formal appearance, imitating structural functions while in reality they are merely ornamental. The structure of the umbrella dome, with its stone radial ribs and conoidal masonry webs, also harks back to medieval types.The Old Sacristy was decorated by Donatello

27009-ceres.jpg	This panel belonged to the cycle depicting the Muses which once adorned the studiolo of the Belfiore Palace in Ferrara. The series was ordered by Lionello d'Este, but brought to completion by his brother Borso d'Este. The decorative scheme included a similar composition depicting an enthroned allegorical figure by Cosm� Tura, now in the National Gallery in London.The image depicts Thalia not as the patron of comedy but as the muse of growing plants, in reference to the efforts of Duke Borso in the areas of soil improvement and agriculture.This is the only known and authentic work of a master who came from Pannonia, the Western part of Hungary. From 1415 onward he seems to have worked at Ferrara and is mentioned in the records as Michele Ongaro, one of the court painters of Borso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. The general style of his work, as well as its strongly graphic character and rich detail, indicate a strong link with the School of Ferrara. The structure and the delicate, enamal-like handling reveal that the painter was an artist of no mean talent

39452-6parad.jpg	"The best description of this picture is by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: ""A Paradise by Tintoretto, or rather the coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven in the presence of all the patriarchs, prophets, saints, angels, etc., a nonsensical idea executed with the greatest genius. There is such ease of brushwork, spirit, and wealth of expression here that to admire and enjoy the piece properly one would have to own it, since the work may be said to be infinite, and the least of the angels' heads have character [...]."

32982-04bibbie.jpg	"At around 1516 Raphael was much sought after by priests and cardinals who competed in the decoration of their mansions in Rome. Cardinal Bernardo Dovizi da Bibbiena undoubtedly had more contact with Raphael than any of his colleagues. Cardinal Bibbiena, the private secretary of Leo X, was the most powerful man at the papal court. He was, in addition, a cultured writer and humanist, and (like Leo X) a passionate scholar of classical antiquity. He even wrote a comedy, ""La Calandria."" His trust in Raphael is demonstrated by many important commissions. His niece even became engaged to Raphael, but she died before the wedding and Raphael remained unmarried.Raphael painted a portrait of the Cardinal which clearly expressed his shrewd and malicious spirit and his taste for beautiful things and fine living. The attribution of the portrait (now in the Pitti Gallery) is not certain, but the composition and the characteristic use of white and red suggest Raphael's hand. However, the rendering seems more rigid than in the paintings certainly painted by Raphael. Some critics therefore attribute it to a pupil of Raphael, or suspect that it may be a copy of an original which might have been lost"

04000-danae.jpg	The theme of the princess confined in a tower and visited by Jupiter in the form of a shower of gold was extremely popular in Italian painting from the 16th century. Bellucci, who often painted mythological series as well as series of nudes for his distinguished clients, treated the subject several times. Another version of the scene painted vertically was made during the artist's sojourn at D�sseldorf and has survived in the Augsburg Gallery. The picture at the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts may be regarded as an earlier work, its pure, unfaltering design and warm colouring show an affinity to the paintings of Bellucci produced in the early 1700s in Vienna.Dana&#235; is frequently represented in Renaissance and Baroque painting.

The two saints have the same three-dimensional qualities as their companions on the outside of the triptych. St John the Baptist is shown with his right arm curved round and up across his chest and left shoulder, and the top of his cross pushed back away from the viewer. The right foot is to the fore. The extended hand of St Mark on the Virgin's right draws the eye into the space occupied by the figure.The central panel of The Virgin and Child differs from its predecessors in Angelico's oeuvre in the absence of a circle of space-defining angels. Greater realism is achieved by translating part of the traditional gold background into elaborate golden curtains which frame the Virgin, the outline thus created echoing a pointed arch. She has the same solidity and three-dimensional qualities as the saints in the work. The Child is clothed and stands upright holding His arms out in blessing. He lacks the overtly puerile qualities of many infant Christ's of the Renaissance and as a result appears medieval or Byzantine

21443-picnic.jpg	By inventing the genre of hunt picnic, Watteau, Lemoyne, and now Lancret blended the hunting picture with scenes of aristocratic dalliance, the recently developed genre of f&#234;te galante. The proximity in date of the examples by Lemoyne and Lancret, and Lancret's subsequent popularisation of the theme, show the degree to which the hunt picnic gave expression to the identity of the aristocracy. Although traditionally the hunt defined this elite class, Louis XV's passion for the sport made it that much more popular with his courtiers and ministers. As exemplified in de Troy pendants - Le D�jeuner de chasse (Mus�e du Louvre, Paris) and the Mort d'un cerf (location unknown) - the culture of the hunt was characterised by oppositions: bloodshed and a celebration of the harmony of nature. Lancret, however, oriented his depictions of the theme almost exclusively toward the pleasant rituals surrounding the hunt

33506-11portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 162.The portrait of Jacob (Jacques) de Gheyn (1596-1641), known as Jacob de Gheyn III because he was the son and grandson of artists of the same name, was painted as a near-companion piece to one of Maurits Huygens (1595-1642), now in the Kunsthalle, Hamburg. The two men were close friends living in The Hague, where Huygens was Secretary to the Council of State, an administrative body under the States-General of the Republic. De Gheyn, like his father and grandfather, was a painter and draughtsman, though not a very prolific one, apparently because he had inherited wealth.The two portraits were almost certainly painted by Rembrandt during a visit to The Hague, and it is likely that Rembrandt was already acquainted with the sitters. A still more important member of the circle for Rembrandt was Huygens' younger brother, Constantijn Huygens (1596-1687), Secretary to the Stadholder Prince Frederick-Hendrik; he was a lover of the arts and literature and had warmly praised Rembrandt's work on a visit to his Leiden studio in 1629. When Jacob de Gheyn died in 1641, he bequeathed Rembrandt's portrait of him to Maurits Huygens, as an affectionate inscription on the back of the panel testifies.The two portraits are unusual in Rembrandt's work in being under life-size. The painting in the Dulwich Picture Gallery has been stolen numerous times, and its size is one factor that has contributed to its numerous thefts

00614-03david.jpg	"The unusual shape of this work is explained by its original use as a parade shield. Its painted scene is exceedingly rare -- most parade shields were decorated with simple coats of arms. This is, in fact, the only shield painted by a recognized master that has survived to the present day. It may have been carried in civic or religious processions or have been made as a sign of  authority for a citizen-governor.Images of young David, who overcame seemingly insurmountable odds to kill the giant, were popular in fifteenth-century Florence, the smallest major power in Italy. The city saw itself threatened by such Goliaths as the pope, the duke of Milan, the king of Naples, and the doge of Venice. David's image is especially appropriate decoration for a shield since, throughout the Psalms, David's poetry echoes the notion of God as his shield: ""His truth shall be thy shield and buckler"" (Ps. 91.4).Like many early Renaissance artists, Castagno has presented the action and its outcome simultaneously: David holds the loaded sling, but already the head of the slain Goliath lies at his feet. David's energetic pose, based perhaps on an ancient statue, creates a strong contour that would have been clear and ""legible"" as the shield was carried. Nevertheless, the youth's body is  well modeled, rounded with light and shadow to give a convincing likeness of a body in action."

31217-08resur1.jpg	This is one of Piero's greatest masterpieces, painted for the Town Hall of his native city and moved from an adjoining room to its present position in the early sixteenth century; the 'di sotto in s&#249;' viewpoint of the enframing columns suggests that it was originally painted rather high on the wall. This exemplifies Piero's ability to use archaic iconographic elements, belonging to the repertory of popular sacred images, yet placing them in an entirely new cultural and stylistic context.Within a framework, formed at the sides by two fake marble columns, the composition is divided into two separate perspective zones. The lower area, where the artist has placed the sleeping guards, has a very low vanishing point. Alberti, in his theoretical writings, suggests that the vanishing point should be at the same level as the figures' eyes. By placing it on a lower level, Piero foreshortens his figures, thus making them more imposing in their monumental solidity. Above the figures of the sleeping sentries, Piero has placed the watchful Christ, no longer seen from below, but perfectly frontally. The resurrected Christ, portrayed with solid peasant features, is nonetheless a perfect representative of Piero's human ideal: concrete, restrained and hieratic as well. The splendid landscape also belongs to the repertory of popular sacred images: Piero has symbolically depicted it as half still immersed in the barenness of winter, and half already brought back to life - resurrected - by springtime.

The fact is that Sisley conveys no sense of an artistic personality. His range of subjects is not great: he painted landscapes only, with an occasional figure. His art in total lacks subjects, techniques or qualities peculiarly his. Yet Sisley's paintings are things of beauty and light, done with ease, the expression of a positive spirit. His unspectacular landscape work alternates between distant and closer views, like the intimate landscapes of the Barbizon school

20861-ming_jar.jpg	Still-life painting occasionally registers the pride that contemporaries took in global trade and colonial endeavour. Like the botanical gardens and finest collections, still-lifes gathered disparate objects from all reaches of Dutch trade, and brought them home, re-presenting them in European terms of science and collecting, without specific concern about their origin. In this painting of fine household items, Willem Kalf effortlessly combined Venetian and Dutch glassware, a recently made Chinese jar for luxury ginger, a Dutch silver dish, a Mediterranean peach, and a half-peeled lemon, the object of citrus trade and of medicinal treatises. He displayed them on an Indian floral carpet, in a dramatic spotlight that invites contemplation and admiration, for the fine wares as well as the artist's recrafting of them. Kalf's jewel technique evokes their value and unifies them in an arrangement, that, however lifelike for each individual object, is clearly pictorial

In front of a columned loggia, which is reminiscent of the Loggia dei Lanzi (between 1376 and 1381) with three bays in Florence, St Augustine appears in several small simultaneous scenes. Here Benozzo makes a more decisive use than he did in Montefalco of the opportunities of emphasizing the scenes in the picture by means of the architecture: in one place, the saint is standing in front of a column, and at another between two columns.In the Arrival of St Augustine in Milan, Benozzo once again combines three scenes from the legend of St Augustine as simultaneous events. On the first occasion St Augustine appears before the columned loggia and a servant is helping him take off his riding clothes. In the background, the saint is kneeling before a Muslim scholar.

08815-bibiana.jpg	"A narrative scene painted on a wall as a framed picture was referred to as a ""quadro riportato,"" which to seventeenth-century thinking suggested that a framed panel painting had been translated into the medium of fresco. Ciampelli's wall pictures in the clerestory of the church of Santa Bibiana belongs to this category. Here the legends of early Christian female martyrs are narrated in a series of six simulated panel pictures. They are set apart from the actual wall decoration by frames and detailed 'tituli' (titles). The wall pictures executed by Pietro da Cortona and Agostino Ciampelli between 1622 and 1626 even imitate the effect of oil paintings in their colouring, in obvious contrast to the effect of the figurative wall decor"

08306-flutepla.jpg	In a room containing shelves and a table, a young man is about to start playing the flute. Placed on the shelves are bowls, plates and jugs as well as bread and cheese. A small cheese (or head of garlic) hangs precariously from a string tied around a nail on the front of the shelf. On a table, diagonally receding to both left and right, is a glass vase full of water. Other containers on the table are surrounded by single pieces of fruit, a teething ring and a violin and bow.The Flute Player was at one stage attributed to Louis Finson, but is now almost universally accepted as the work of Cecco del Caravaggio. However, doubts are still being voiced about a possible collaboration with a specialist in still-life painting. The subject of an instrumentalist derives from Caravaggio's Lute Player (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and in this case the artist must have been a friend, student or model of Caravaggio's. The mysterious figure of 'Francesco, called Cecco del Caravaggio' mentioned by Giulio Mancini, has recently acquired a slightly more precise identity. The examination of known works by this artist led to the hypothesis that he was from France, Flanders or Spain.

25207-adorati.jpg	This panel shows the mature Soft Style in admirable purity. The gentle carriage and devotion-inspiring countenance of the Virgin are in keeping with the solemn genuflexion of the kings approaching with presents. The group of, as it were, boneless figures, so flexible as to tolerate moulding into any attitude at will, strives to evoke an ideal world where gracility of the Gothic line is the supreme law, believed to ennoble every visible figure and manifestation. The luxuriant greensward of long blades of grass strewn with white flowers emphasizes the plane-like arrangement of the figures; perspective seems to have been immaterial to the artist.The painter was given his name after a work representing the Adoration of Jesus, which is preserved in Vienna. His picture in Budapest is the size of a folio and is (like his other works) a domestic altar painted with the delicacy of a miniature.The scene takes place in a rocky landscape with flowers and grass, which lack any geometrical order and any architecture. The Magi, having arrived from the left without a retinue, are about to reverentially hand over their gifts to the Virgin and Child seated on the right. Balthasar, the youngest among them, is a nearly symmetrical counterpart of the figure of the Madonna, who is bending slightly forwards. Balthasar's rather feminine figure and the wing-like, fluttering back edge of his garment reminds us of the Archangel Gabriel of the Annunciation. The top left corner is filled by the figure of a youthful shepherd, characterized by colours identical with the Virgin's. He is leaning with his elbow against the background. Like repeated designs with small variations clumps of softly moving grass, weightlessly curving and bending like pond weed, appear in the foreground interspersed with a diversity of flowers, whose petals are spread like points of a star. The Virgin's left hand, with the fingers opening like petals, is a telling example of the way of thinking in terms of ornamental designs, and is characteristic both of the painter and of the period.Soft modelling is very evident in the whole composition. When he had carefully arranged the edges of the draperies on the ground and meticulously conveyed the difference between the parts of the folds in the light and those in shade, the painter paid greater attention to them than to the rather schematic and blank faces. To such an extent is softness a part of his art that he had difficulties in depicting hard, metallic surfaces (see, for example, the modelling of the crowns and the presents). The Master of the Vienna Adoration learned a lot from the Master of Trebon, who was a generation older than him. The Virgin's figure, gently bent slightly forwards, her round head with a lofty forehead, and the softly drawn and carefully arranged deep folds of her mantle are reminiscent of the picture of Hlubok�. The uncertain representation of the pose of kneeling is also similar in the two pictures

38244-mirror.jpg	Shortly after completing his apprenticeship, Strozzi entered the capuchin convent of Santa Barbara in Genoa. Although he was to leave the convent later as a lay preacher, his ascetic inner attitude is evident throughout his ceuvre. Here, he portrays an old woman with jaded skin and white hair who is denying herself the dignity of old age. She is having her hair sumptuously styled and ornamented with ribbons and feathers, is wearing a youthful, low-cut dress and admiring herself with pleasure in the mirror.The theme of this painting has a long tradition: the old woman who has not learned to give her life any other meaning but that of ornament and vanity, and who is unable to see the truth or recognize her true self in the mirror. Strozzi's formulation, however, is both individual and new. It makes the most of the surface values, deliberately contrasting the wrinkled skin of the old woman with the fresh complexion of her servant and juxtaposing the firm and rounded forms of youth with the withered slackness of old age. He reveals in the mirror that the old woman's red cheeks are painted with rouge, and he places a blossoming, scented rose in her wrinkled hand. He also shows us the uncriticizing complacency on her face, leaving it up to the spectator to deduce a sense of embarrassment, emptiness, transparent illusion and moral warning

02512-8pair1.jpg	In correspondence to the Four Seasons was the series created three years later in 1566, the Four Elements. Through a paired arrangement of the qualities in the objects, warm-cold and damp-dry, the elements correspond to the seasons. Thus, the warm-dry summer corresponds to fire, the cold-damp winter to water, the warm-moist spring to air and the cold-dry autumn to earth. Thereby, through the arrangement of the heads, turned to the left or to the right, corresponding pairs face each other and form a unit. So, if desired, they could be arranged into a pair-grouping in which each head in one series would face its corresponding head in the other, as follows: Spring - Air, Summer - Fire, Autumn - Earth, Winter - Water.This picture shows the pairs Air (Private collection)- Spring (Madrid) as well as Summer (Vienna) - Fire (Vienna)

34465-21rippl.jpg	"In 1908, Rippl bought a villa in the middle of a woodland on the R�ma-hill, a part of  Kaposv�r. After evocative interiors, he painted a series of nudes there. He selected models from people around him: ""In my art, there is a long and feverish Lazarine-peiord. In addition, ... Anella, the child of my wife's sister ... The third model, in whom I was particularly interested, was Fenella."" These pictures of Rippl-R�nai represented the ""corn"" style of patches of paint. The picture shows six nudes bending rhythmically. There are two slim female figures in the background with harehounds lying and standing, a hedge running crosswise, tree trunks, trees, bushes and patches of the sky. It is a decorative plainlike composition. A dotted brown contour surrounds the female nudes. Rippl-R�nai painted bodies as if they were plain, yet the brush left traces of whorls. He modelled the homogenous surface richer. This basically two-dimensional composition highlighted the main character, i.e. the series of nudes moving harmonically. Other elements of the picture are completely homogenous, they consist of patches of paint on one another. He uses two shades of green: the path is fawn-coloured, the sky is yellow, the tree trunk is purple and the colour of the pulp paper appears here and there. Rippl-R�nai was for alla prima painting which assumed quick work. The method he applied was as follows: first, he drew contours which soaked into the pulp paper, then he filled surfaces in between with unpolished colours. He painted the colours right out of the tubes. ""One mustn't mix colours on the picture,"" this was Rippl-R�nai's negative order of making colours fiery"

00582-06apollo.jpg	"The influence of Domenico Veneziano's painting is strong in the decoration of the refectory of Sant'Apollonia which Andrea painted between June and October 1447. He solved the problem posed by the height of the refectory walls in Sant'Apollonia by using the old method of arranging the scenes in two rows, one above the other, but he gave them a visual unity: the Stories of Christ's Passion frescoed on the upper level are in fact conceived as taking place in a space behind the room where the Last Supper on the lower level is happening. The three scenes from the Passion (the Resurrection, Crucifixion and Entombment) are connected to each other by a group of flying angels all converging towards the figure of Christ in the centre, and by a common landscape background, which has been correctly judged ""the most powerful interpretation, of the Tuscan landscape in the entire history of painting"" (Berti).The scene that has been most highly praised, and which is probably the best preserved, is the Resurrection, originally the first to the left"

05598-11judith.jpg	The stylistic change undergone by Botticelli's art is demonstrated especially vividly through a comparison of his Judith Leaving the Tent of Holofernes, from the late 1490s, with the work of similar subject from some thirty years previously.In the earlier work, the picture was dominated by movement and lively gracefulness; now, concentrated pictorial composition and simplicity come to the fore. With the former picture, the observer's thoughts were distracted by the detailed presentation of the figures and the background; in the later version, Botticelli has left out everything that could divert attention from the principal figure, from Judith herself. Thus, Abra the maid no longer appears next to Judith, but is relegated to the dark opening of the tent in the background. At the same time, Botticelli has reduced everything of a decorative nature to a minimum. Background and earth appear merely as a monotone surface, while the dark, unadorned garments remind one that the elegant flow of folds found in the bright, richly ornamented dress of the earlier portrayals is absent here. In this work too, the form of Judith herself strikes us as having overlong proportions, such as strangely distort her and present a crass contrast to the gracefulness of the earlier Judith. Botticelli was evidently less concerned in this late phase with entertaining the observer, concentrating rather on a form of his pictorial subject matter which would edify and instruct.

21356-landscap.jpg	"In the first half of the seventeenth century many Dutch painters made the long journey to Italy to familiarize themselves with Italian art. Pieter van Laer lived in Rome from 1623 to 1639, and the picture in the Budapest collection was painted during the last years of his stay. The free composition of his paintings, the broad gestures and bright sunshine illuminating the colours reveal what most captivated the artist, who had moved south from the grey rainclouds of the Netherland skies.Genre painters often represent some play or game. The simplest social game is the ""morra"" for which no objects are needed because the fingers of the hand suffice. This primitive entertainment has brought together this bunch of penniless, ragged tramps. Laer wilfully apprehended them and their environment in what they are common, trivial and humorous, too unlike the other canvases of the painter.

Kalf began by painting similar motifs: little pictures of kitchens and barns, as well as large still-lifes of metalwork, glass, and porcelain.

38436-04szinye.jpg	"Szinyei made his firs attempts at ""plein-air"" painting, the type of representation that aptcures the shimmering atmosphere around the objects, at the same time, but quite independently from the French Impressionists. ""The Swing"" is one of the most beautiful of the ""plein-air"" picture sketches he painted in Munich at the beginning of his career. It is a fresh colourful scene with natural, loosely linked figures, the flying swing, sunny walls and patches of sunlight on the dresses.Just like the Impressionists, Szinyei was also mocked for his originality. One of his colleagues called this picture a ""fashion plate"" because the figures were in contemporary clothes and not in the traditional historical or folk costumes. Szinyei was so upset that he never painted the full-scale work he had intended. Later he gave it to J�zsef Rippl-R�nai who discovered it as an early Impressionist masterpiece.The Neue Pinakothek in Munich offered him 4,000 marks for the sketchs, but he would not part with it.

40840-c_parr.jpg	Catherine Parr (1512-48) was the sixth and last wife of King Henry VIII of England (ruled 1509-47). This portrait is her only authentic depiction. She was admired by contemporaries for her eloquence and goodness; she interceded for the victims of Henry's religious persecutions and supervised the upbringing of Edward, Henry's only male heir.She was a daughter of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendall, an official of the royal household. Catherine had been widowed twice - in marriages to Edward Borough (died c. 1529) and to John Neville, Lord Latimer (died 1542 or 1543) - by the time she married Henry on July 12, 1543.Her tactfulness enabled her to exert a beneficial influence on the King during the last years of his reign. She developed close friendships with the three children Henry had by previous marriages and devoted herself to their education.She took care of Edward's half sisters Mary and Elizabeth, who, as daughters of Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn respectively, had been declared bastards. Thanks to Catherine, they were both acknowledged as princesses again.A Humanist, she was friendly with Protestant reformers. Timely access to the King saved her from conservatives, especially Stephen Gardiner, who were bent on her destruction in 1546.After Henry's death in January 1547 she married a former suitor, Thomas, Lord Seymour of Sudeley, who was admiral of England from 1547 to 1549, but she died shortly after giving birth to a daughter. A learned and deeply religious woman, she wrote A Lamentacion or Complaynt of a Sinner in the last year of her life

06145-pan_syri.jpg	Pan in Greek mythology is the god of woods and fields, flocks and herds. In Renaissance allegory he personifies Lust; he charmed the nymphs with the music of his pipes. The story of Pan and Syrinx is described by Ovid (Metamorphoses 1:689-713). Pan was pursuing a nymph of Arcadia named Syrinx when they reached the River Ladon which blocked her escape. To avoid the god's clutches she prayed to be transformed, and Pan unexpectedly found himself holding an armful of tall reeds. The sound of the wind blowing through them so pleased him that he cut some and made a set of pipes which are named after the nymph

32645-1mercury.jpg	Mercury and Herse, which was formerly attributed to Adam Elsheimer, is a testimony to the great success enjoyed by a painting, now lost, of the same subject by the German master. The painting was admired by members of the group of Italianised painters in Rome, one of whom was the Dutch artist Jacob Pynas, to whom the authorship of this work on copper has now been credited.The story is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses (II, 708-729) which conveniently allowed artists to combine a classical literary source with landscape painting. Mercury, who has just punished the shepherd Battus for disloyalty, is flying over the farmlands and woods of Attica when he spots a procession of young girls wending their way to the sanctuary of Minerva. Conspicuous in the procession for her beauty is one of the daughters of Cecrops, Herse; the sight of her arouses instant passion in the god, who descends to earth in the hope of encountering her. The story ends with the transformation of the envious Aglauros, Herse's sister, into stone.For his painting Elsheimer chose the moment when Mercury espied Herse for the first time, which gave him the opportunity to paint an aerial landscape with a procession of young girls winding through it. Elsheimer's lead was followed by Paul Bril in a small painting on copper (Devonshire collection, Chatsworth), by Cornelis van Poelenburch in his youthful painting (Mauritshuis, The Hague) and by Hermann van Swanevelt, who also used the subject in the late 1630s for a painting on canvas (Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Rome). Jacob Pynas's painting fits into this popular context. His interpretation of the landscape, particularly the feathered leaves of the trees, the atmospheric depth and the presence of a small classical temple in the background, seems dependent on the brilliant prototypes mentioned above which date between 1610 and 1615. In particular, the balanced composition, combined with an intense softness in the painting of the natural elements, seems to be a stylistic reference to the mature work of Bril. This could provide further confirmation of the new chronology of Jacob Pynas's stay in Rome, recently altered from 1605-08 to around 1617/18, when his elder brother Jan enjoyed a second sojourn in Italy. This painting is therefore probably more or less contemporary with one of the few works signed and dated by Jacob, his Mercury and Battus (Wiener collection, New York) of 1618

44620-01lifebo.jpg	"Mih�ly Zichy was 19 years old when he painted the picture. Zichy, a pupil of Waldm�ller in Vienna, went on with his career in Pest the same year. Although his master, a realist of character portrayal, had taught Zichy the same ideas, the picture was by no manner of menas similar to the popular and amusing style of Austrian genre painting. The picture can be linked to G�ricault and Delacroix who initiated French romanticism. By moving the figures right into the foreground, Zichy gave a psychologic analysis of his defenceless figures. Typical figures of Vienna biedermeier appear in the picture: small children playfully stretching out for the crucifix, old women praying, old men with beard and models of the art academy. What makes the picture even more surprising is young Zichy's skills of dramatic portrayal of the scene.Th�ophile Gautier, the French apostle of romanticism, called young Zichy ""monstre de g�nie"" because he increased tensions to the utmost in his pictures.

23442-maurizio.jpg	In the Benedictine convent church of San Maurizio in Milan the nuns' enclosure was separated from the section of the church for the laity by a partition (tramezzo in Italian). The partition was integrated into the rhythm and articulation of the nave with the series of pilasters arches continuing across the partition. Hence the painting had to subordinate itself to the architecture, which assigned it its field.Bernardino Luini frescoed the walls in the 1520s. The decoration was donated by Alessandro Bentivoglio, son of the former ruler of Bologna, and his Milanese wife, Ippolita Sforza Bentivoglio. Both the donors are depicted together with female saints in the side arch bays. The portraits face the altar, above which, in the middle, where the altarpiece would later be located, there was originally a tall grill, behind which stood the nuns' chancel. In the upper register of the painted wall, on either side of the Assumption of the Virgin, are two scenes from the legend of St Maurice, the patron saint of the church. Such architectonically articulated barriers were frequently repeated in later churches in Milan

24810-triptic3.jpg	This panel is one of three paintings in Frankfurt which derive from a dismantled retable whose original appearance is not known. Probably the retable had double wings on each side. The interior could have been painted. The three panels are also the representative work of the artist from Tournai known as the Master of Fl�malle, identified as Robert Campin.This side panel represents St Veronica who holds the cloth marked with the face of Christ, while the other the standing figure of Virgin Mary who suckles the infant Christ. In the background of the side panels the artist uses a background of brocade hangings to produce a space without depth. The third panel, probably from the reverse side of the retable, represents the Holy Trinity in grisaille: God the Father supports the dead Christ and shows the body to the whole community; the Holy Spirit is present in the form of a dove.St Veronica appears delicate and psychologically isolated in her emotion. The lower part of the figure, where her clothes are gathered into elegant folds, is three-dimensional, but around the shoulders it is made to look comparatively flat, so as not to stand out too much from the entirely non-spatial, strongly patterned brocade of the background. The folds of her garments form patterns and matching correspondences, for instance where the end of her green sleeve on the right is echoed by the end of the red cloak hanging to the ground. There is deliberate beauty of form in the elaborate cloth framing Veronica's face.Veronica is standing on a comparatively deep piece of natural ground that ends against a flat and entirely unrealistic wall that seems very close to the figure at the top, thus the illusion of a shrine or niche is given. In other words the saint is displayed as if in a carved shrine

44270-1rome.jpg	Van Vittel (Gaspare Vanvitelli in Italy) specialized in topographically accurate views of cities. Portraits of cities and specific buildings were not new in his days, Dutch and Flemish contemporaries in Italy also made urban views. However, van Wittel was the first Italianate to concentrate on the category.Van Wittel's topographical views are called 'vedute'. Although the term was used in Italy to characterize pictures of Rome and its environs long before van Wittel appeared on the scene, he is rightly credited with establishing vedute as an independent category of painting. In his time the term began to be used to characterize portrayals of other cities and their sites. Van Wittel's own oeuvre includes some of Venice, Florence, Bologna, Naples, and other places on the Italian peninsula. Strictly speaking one can speak of vedute of Amsterdam, Paris, London, Dresden, St. Petersburg, and so forth, but customary usage confines the term to topographical views of Italy.Van Wittel starts in Italy by following the tradition established in the sixteenth century of depicting the sights of the city in prints which culminates in the following century in Piranesi's peerless etchings of Rome. What sets van Wittel apart from earlier printmakers of Roman urban buildings and spaces was the practice he soon began of translating his views into paint. The market for his views of the Eternal City was good. During a period of more than thirty years he produced several versions of the most important sights. His innovative sun-drenched vedute done in light tonalities had little influence in his native land but they had an enduring effect in Italy where they set examples for leading eighteenth-century Italian veduta painters including Pannini in Rome and Guardi and Canaletto in Venice.

24140-5sebast1.jpg	"Between 1490 and 1506, the year he died, Mantegna painted several devotional paintings in which the main figures are represented as reliefs standing out against a mostly dark background. Inspired by reliefs on classical tombs, these figures are shown partially hidden behind stone balustrades or a frame. The most impressive of the paintings from Mantegna's final years include the Ecce Homo in the Mus�e Jacquemart-Andr�, Paris, and the St Sebastian in the Ca' d'Oro, Venice.The martyrdom of St Sebastian was a recurring theme in Mantegna's work, favoured because it combined a religious subject with the chance to paint an athletic male nude. At the beginning of 1506, the plague was rife in Mantua, and this saint was called on for protection, since his martyred body symbolized a triumph over pain and death.In his painting of 1506, Mantegna again employs the painted frame he used in earlier paintings, but here it takes the form of a stone niche. The imposing figure of the saint, with its almost sculptural outline, emerges with dramatic sharpness from the dark background. To illustrate the saint's return from death all the more clearly, Mantegna broke with tradition and portrayed a St Sebastian who is not bound to a pillar or a tree. The parchment wrapped around the candle at the right bottom corner carries the inscription: NIL NISI DIVINUM STABILE EST: CAETERA FUMUS (""Nothing is eternal but God: all else is smoke""). Thus the painting becomes a representation of vanitas and warns of the transitory nature of earthly values.This extraordinarily dramatic work was painted for the bishop of Mantua Ludovico Gonzaga and was still in the artist's studio when he died"

22652-1virgi.jpg	"Criticism usually holds that this was painted about 1452 and that it is to be identified with a painting recorded documentarily as done for Lorenzo Bartolini. The tondo form, the themes of birth and fecundity, and the possible intention of having the family coat-of-arms painted on the reverse of the panel all suggest that the tondo was intended to commemorate the birth of one of the Bartolini children and derives from the ""desco da parto"" tradition.The painting (also called the Pitti Tondo) is one of the most celebrated and most beautiful works of Filippo Lippi. The shape of the circular panel, which was such a favourite in the Quattrocento for religious compositions, is used by the artist with perfect skill. The pure face of the Virgin coincides almost exactly with centre of the panel, as it is also the spiritual fulcrum. She and the Child, who is posed with infantile grace, constitute the principal object of veneration and of vision. The two lateral scenes, linked together by the beautiful figures of the women who approach the newly made mother, St Anne, lying on the bed on the left, form almost exactly two segments of the circle. In allusion to the future birth of the Virgin is the Meeting of Joachim and Anne at the Golden Gate on the right above - small figures which stand out in the luminous geometry of the walls, windows and staircase.The clearly marked drawing has a great importance in the painting of Filippo Lippi. His is a subtle line in continual movement and curve, repeating itself with the lightness of an arabesque around the slender, elongated figures. The utmost purification of the human form, as the artist loved it, appears in the sensitive and refined figure of the Virgin. To bring it into harmony with the delicacy of the line and its prepondering part, Lippi's colour has a great transparence, with light tones, somewhat subdued, and very subtle in their gradations: pinks, ivory whites and transparent greens"

10604-negro_pa.jpg	After about 1642 Cuyp came under the influence of painters in Utrecht like Jan Both, who had worked for several years in Italy. His tight descriptive early style, nurtured by Jan van Goyen and Salomon van Ruysdael, now suddenly gave way to a broader, more effulgent style in which the landscape is soaked in a golden light. This style reaches its climax during the 1650s when Cuyp created an imaginary landscape based on personal recollections of the North, but transformed by an appreciation of the South, particularly the Italian campagna, derived from other painters. A distant view, bathed in mist and the warm glow of a late afternoon light, proved irresistible to early collectors. River Landscape with Horseman and Peasants (London, National Gallery), which waspainted around 1655, is perhaps the finest example of Cuyp's mature style, but The Negro Page, dating in all probability from a few years earlier, is not far removed in quality. The types of the buildings, the hilly background and the lake are common to both paintings and may be a reflection of Cuyp's journey up the Rhine as far as Nijmegen and Kleve, near the German border, at the beginning of the 1650s.Cuyp was economical with his motifs and several of those in The Negro Page recur in other paintings. For example, in Huntsman halted (Birmingham, Barber Institute of Fine Arts) Cuyp deploys similar horses, dogs and groom in a different composition. Dappled horses and negro pages are frequently found in other works by the artist of comparable date. The spaniel in the foreground of the present work is similarly posed in the painting of Orpheus (Marquess of Bute's collection). Some of the motifs are the subject of preparatory drawings either by Cuyp or his studio, such as the spaniel (Vienna, Albertina), the greyhound and the vegetation on the left (Paris, Lugt Foundation; London, British Museum, amongst others). The figure on the right facing the viewer has been tentatively identified as one of Cornelis van Beveren's sons, perhaps Willem (born 1624) who was appointed Bailiff and Dyke-Reeve of the Lande van Strien in 1648. This identification is based on the fact that his mount's horse brass is in the form of a fleur-de-lys, which suggests a connection with France (a knighthood was conferred on Cornelis van Beveren by the French king, Louis XIII).Cuyp spent nearly all of his life in Dordrecht. His marriage in 1650 to Cornelia Boschman, the widow of a wealthy Regent, led to a decline in his artistic output as he devoted more time to a career in public life. His work was particularly appreciated by members of the Regent class in Dordrecht, and Cuyp deliberately cultivated the social mores in the paintings dating from the 1650s. These social distinctions are detectable in dress, the emphasis on equitation, the relationship of the figures to architecture and the prominence of servants

02914-distress.jpg	Backhuysen is the last representative of the great tradition of Dutch marine painting; eighteenth-century Dutch artists did much less of consequence in this category than in the others they practised.Backhuysen was born in Emden, Germany, and came to Amsterdam around the middle of the century where he remained for the rest of his life. His high-placed patrons include the burgomasters of Amsterdam, the Archduke of Tuscany, Czar Peter the Great, and various German princes. He is best known for his stormy scenes. Houbraken writes that when a storm threatened he sometime went by boat 'to the mouth of the Sea, in order to observe the crash of the Seawater under these conditions'.His Ships in Distress off a Rocky Coast shows the chilling drama he can bring to the theme. The large cargo ship in the centre is managing to make way along the perilous coast, while on the right, two vessels are in even greater danger.Later his storms become melodramatic, his chiaroscuro effects exaggerated, and his gigantic waves rather schematic and glass-like

14914-1ponta02.jpg	In 1886, Gauguin settled in Pont-Aven, a small coastal village in Brittany. Here he devoted himself entirely to painting. In the present painting the depiction of local costumes and dancing shows the painter's interest in Breton peasant life.Although this work represents Breton subject matter, it was probably painted from memory and from sketches back in Paris in the winter of 1886-87, an indication that Gauguin was already edging towards the synthetist treatment for his subjects by this time. The forms have been deliberately flattened, with attention paid to the white headresses and small shawls worn by the women, and a deliberate suppression of atmosphere and distance within the picture space by avoidance of a horizon and by the use of saturated colours.Despite its authentic 'primitive' feel, the work is an elaborate fiction. The fancy dress that the woman are wearing had been abandoned by the Breton peasantry except for the celebration of pardons, and they were enjoying a period of relative prosperity, in part financed by a flourishing tourist trade. By painting works like this from memory, Gauguin could confect a vision of Breton life that was much closer to his notion of what constituted a 'primitive' existence than any that he could have found at this time

21299-03paymen.jpg	An important early picture of La Tour is the surviving Payment of Dues, only identified in 1972, even though it has been in the museum at Lvov since at least the early nineteenth century. (Formerly the painting was attributed to Honthorst.) The picture was cleaned soon after its debut in Paris at the time of the La Tour exhibition in 1972, and a date was revealed. This date, thought to be 1634, has caused a great deal of controversy. If 1634 is correct, a drastic reassessment of La Tour's stylistic development must be made. The early pictures of saints remain from the 1620s, and then in the early 1630s La Tour moves towards his second phase, basically a Le Clerc-influenced period. The swaying figures and flickering lighting of the Payment of Dues are especially reminiscent of Le Clerc's Concert at Schleissheim. There is a certain ambiguity - often present in La Tour - in the subject, which appears to have been little studied. At first sight it is a simple peasant scene of the rich extracting money, ruthlessly, from the poor, but it could be a depiction of the 'Calling of Matthew' (the tax collector). It was given to La Tour in 1970 when the signature was found

40454-library.jpg	"Konstantin Andreyevich Ukhtomsky was a Russian watercolourist who recorded with precision the interiors in the New Hermitage in St. Petersburg.Seeking to perpetuate Voltaire's memory in Russia after his death, Empress Catherine II commissioned Jean-Antoine Houdon, then one of the most famous sculptors, to make the statue of the philosopher seated in an armchair that now adorns the Hermitage collection of Neoclassical sculpture. Two bronze statuettes - variants of the model for the sculpture ordered from Houdon by Voltaire's niece and heiress, Madame Denis - were sent to the Russian empress in 1779. Suitably impressed, Catherine requested Houdon to produce a marble version for her as well (the first, virtually identical to the Hermitage work, was installed in the foyer of the Com�die-Fran�aise theatre in Paris). The statue was given a home in the empress's summer residence at Tsarskoye Selo. In 1805, during the reign of Catherine's grandson Alexander I, the statue was moved to the hermitage which housed Voltaire""'s celebrated library, acquired in its entirety from Madame Denis in 1778"

44769-st_hugo.jpg	Zurbar�n's painting of a Carthusian refectory intensely reflects the ideal of this order of hermit monks: simplicity, sobriety and quiet contemplation. The room is unadorned, but for a painting showing the Virgin and Child with John the Baptist in the wilderness - an inspiration to the monks. An arched doorway opens out towards a typically simple Carthusian church. The monks, dressed in white cassocks, are seated at the table on which there are only plates of bread. With the exception of one monk whose hands are folded in prayer, they are all completely immersed in introspective contemplation with their eyes cast down, apparently paying no attention to the guest to whom the elderly abbot, St Hugo, appears to be explaining the life of the monastery. This painting exudes an atmosphere of tranquillity unaffected by the event portrayed

Mother and child are portrayed 'en face', and both gaze intently in our direction. Joseph on the left is eclipsed by the two protagonists. He sits at an angle facing them, on a seat lower than the Virgin's. He looks up and focuses on a point  somewhere outside the picture, as if reflecting on the words he has just read in the open book on his lap. He holds his reading glasses absent-mindedly and is clearly lost in thought.

30064-3wolfga3.jpg	The picture shows one of the panels of the St Wolfgang Altarpiece.Although the St Wolfgang Altarpiece shows a purely German emotionalism, the richness of the brocades, the attention given to the structure of the bodies and the landscape, the bold foreshortenings and viewpoints and finally the complete mastery of the use of light, show the influence exerted on Pacher's work by the school of Mantegna and of Giovanni Bellini. This new understanding of one of the essential problems of Renaissance painting, 'namely composition in depth rendered by means of linear and aerial perspective, must have been in the nature of a revelation to the German school, which had ignored the achievement of Witz. It was Pacher, together with Rueland Frueauf the Younger of Salzburg, with their great perception of the charms of the rural setting, who paved the way for the ` landscapists ' of the Danube school whose work influenced the still expressionistic Cranach at the beginning of the 16th century.

13011-killigre.jpg	Van Dyck's double portraits usually explore such themes as kinship or friendship, but the present painting depicts two figures united by grief. The circumstances in which the painting was undertaken and the elegiac mood created by the subtle monochromatic tones make this one of the most moving double portraits painted by Van Dyck. Thomas Killigrew (1612-83), a royalist poet, playwright and wit, is seated on the left looking out of the composition. The pose with the head supported by the hand is traditionally associated with melancholy.This state of mind in a man who was only twenty-six years of age was induced by the recent death of his wife, Cecilia Crofts. She died (possibly from plague) on 1 January 1638 after two years of marriage. He wears his wife's wedding ring attached to his left wrist by a black band. A silver cross inscribed with her intertwined initials is attached to his other sleeve. He holds a piece of paper on which there are drawings, possibly made with a funerary monument in mind. The other figure has been variously identified, but the most satisfactory suggestion is that he is William, Lord Crofts (c.1611-77), Killigrew's brother-in-law, who suffered a double loss at the beginning of 1638, since another sister, Anne, Duchess of Cleveland, died shortly after Cecilia. The paper held by Crofts is blank, but clearly it formed the basis for discussion between the two sitters - a discussion presumably meant to console, but from which Killigrew is distracted by grief. The mood of the picture, therefore, unifies the composition on one level, but so do the contrasting poses, with one figure seen from the front and the other from the back with the face turned in profile. There is also an allegorical link provided by the broken column, a symbol both of mortality and of fortitude.Killigrew's friendships with other poets are also significant for appreciating this portrait. Thomas Carew wrote a poem commemorating the marriage of Killigrew and Cecilia Crofts (29 June 1636), while Francis Quarles wrote an elegy on the deaths of the two sisters. By showing the two sitters in conversation Van Dyck is demonstrating the sense of loss while also suggesting a means for its cure, since, according to contemporary literary convention, words had the power to heal the troubled soul. At the same time, in pictorial terms the device of depicting figures in the act of talking was a way of evoking their actual presence more effectively. The thematic and psychological interactions that characterise this double portrait are a supreme demonstration of Van Dyck's abilities as a portrait painter

33385-08newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 602.In this painting the light and shadow are closely interwoven. A fluctuation from the one to the other takes place, producing a tenebrous atmosphere, full of mysterious effect. But more than this is achieved: by the fluctuating light the figure is expressly connected with the surrounding space, and the space itself is drawn into the representation. It becomes a vibrant, living medium. Space and figure in Rembrandt's art now share one inseparable existence and are equally expressive. At this point of his development Rembrandt was already able to use chiaroscuro to give the atmosphere both a visual and a spiritual meaning.Throughout his career, chiaroscuro remained his most powerful means of expression. Of course, there are other important features of his art: his colouristic treatment, his compositional devices; but in a way they are all subordinated to, or in any case co-ordinated with, his chiaroscuro

00022-cornaro.jpg	"In Rome it was customary to decorate church choirs on high church holidays with temporary decorations constructed of coloured papier m&#226;ch� or canvas. The most famous of these are the ones created by Pietro da Cortona for the forty-hour prayer in Rome's San Lorenzo in Damaso during Holy Week in 1633. Drawings and engravings of these temporary ""sacred sets"" are the earliest evidence of the increasing tendency in the seventeenth century to transform church spaces into stages for heavenly apparitions and visions. One of the first decorations belonging to this category was the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome, designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In it architecture, sculpture, and painting combine to form a theatrical whole.

21316-06carpe.jpg	On the same deep level as in the Job, in a similar vein but more complex in composition, is the Christ in the Carpenter's Shop in the Louvre. As in the Job, one of the figures is arched over the top of the canvas, and again the attention to mood is shown in the minute observation of the effects of light in certain areas, especially that of the translucency of the child's hand silhouetted against the candle, revealing even the dirt in the fingernails. As usual, La Tour tells the Bible story in the simplest of terms. Only items essential for identifying the subject, in this case the paraphernalia of the carpenter's shop, are included. The picture can exist on the level of a genre scene without religious overtones, and its realism makes it one of the greatest genre paintings of the seventeenth century, rivaling Vel�zquez's Water Seller of Seville and Rembrandt's Jewish Bride (the latter has also been interpreted as a religious or mythological subject)

10663-bigallo.jpg	Bernardo Daddi is a painter, whose sensitivity was more suited to panel painting then to frescoes, which he rarely painted. This triptych intended for personal devotion is typical; his pictures are intimate, even those intended for important public places. In the centre the Virgin smiles gently as she admonishes the playful Christ Child. The delicate Gothic forms of the throne provide ample space for her, yet seem to diminish her monumental size.

05934-mad_chil.jpg	"The fresco is from the New Court House in Piazza dei Mercanti, Milan. The angel on the left holds a paper with the words ""Soli Deo,"" one of the mottos used by Marshal Trivulzio, whose funerary chapel was designed by Bramantino.This work shows, in the relationships between figures and landscape, the innovations that Bramantino brought to Lombard painting. His drive toward ""cubist"" abstraction is less intense, finding expression only in the base supporting the figures, with its unusual motif of stylised palm leaves and its elegant profile. The serene frontal composition is softened by the undulating rhythm that falls from the Madonna's hand that is holding the Child's, through the body of the Infant, to its conclusion in the heavy folds of the drapery. Lighted by a source in front, and set against a predominantly white sky, the figures show an unusually lively range of colours. The angels, seen in penumbra, are dressed in olive green and red, while the Madonna wears a pale blue mantle over her raspberry robe, and has an iridescent kerchief on her head"

10615-view_dor.jpg	Aelbert Cuyp lived and worked in Dordrecht which, although a small provincial town, had a flourishing local school of painting. Nicolaes Maes, Samuel van Hoogstraten and Aert de Gelder also worked in the town.Cuyp's early landscape style is close both in its grey-green palette and sketchy technique to that of Jan van Goyen but in the early 1640s his style was transformed by his encounter with the landscape style which the Utrecht artist Jan Both had developed during his stay in Italy. Cuyp never visited Italy but he developed an idiosyncratic version of Both's style. He bathed his very Dutch landscapes in a golden Italian sunlight which sparkles on the water and warms the stones of the buildings. Having adopted and refined his version of the Italianate landscape style, Cuyp practised it for many years of a successful career, which he ended as a member of the regent class of Dordrecht and an elder of the Reformed Church, the owner of a fine town house and an extensive country estate.Because his style does not develop significantly his paintings are difficult to date but this view of his native town from the River Maas was probably painted in about 1655. The outline of the city is dominated by the profiles of the Groothooftspoort on the left and the squat tower of the Grote Kerk, a familiar landmark in Cuyp's many views of his home town, to the right

09837-courb102.jpg	Thanks to his friends, Courbet was finally able to realize his dream of painting a large-scale composition that would cement his reputation. Exhibited at the 1849 Salon, After Dinner at Ornans is set around a table in Caravaggesque fashion. It shows Courbet's father, R�gis, to the left, along with three regular visitors to the household: Urbain Cuenot in the background, propped on his elbow, Adolphe Marlet with his back turned and lighting a pipe, and Alphonse Promayet playing his instrument. The painting is life size and combines a strongly rural atmosphere with a touch of willful sentimentality. Widely praised, it was purchased by the French State in the person of Charles Blanc, the Director of the Beaux-Arts.This genre scene of imposing dimensions testifies to the debt Courbet owed to an entire tradition of realistic French painting, from the Le Nain brothers to Chardin. Presenting an image of country life at once serene, reassuring and musical, it gave him his first success at the Salon. It earned Courbet a gold medal, which meant that he no longer needed to submit his paintings to the Salon jury

The Capilla del Milagro, although tiny in scale, is replete with every device of pictorial illusionism. In order to impart a feeling of expansiveness to the space, Rizi painted a fictional colonnade, beyond which there is a view into an illusionistic, columned hall.

37874-certosa.jpg	In the former sacristy chapel, which is now only a passageway, Massimo Stanzione decorated the ceiling in 1644. Although Stanzione specialised in altarpieces, he was also highly successful in Naples as a wall and ceiling painter. In accordance with the technical realities of the medium, in these works the richly contrasting chiaroscuro of his oil paintings gives way to buoyant, saturated colours clearly influenced by the Bolognese artists. The vault of the former sacristy chapel is the best example of his style as a painter in fresco, one schooled in the academic painting of Rome but enlivened by a Neapolitan temperament.The decorative system on the ceiling frames an arrangement of pictures. There are four scenes from the Passion in the vault's spandrel: Nailing to the Cross; Erecting of the Cross; Longinus Piercing Christ in the Side with His Spear; Descent from the Cross. In the centre of the vault the scene of the Ascension of Christ is depicted. Four Old Testament scenes are in the pear-shaped cartouches around the central scene, between them the four evangelists are represented in a scale far larger than that of the figures in the paintings

06906-merry_c.jpg	Buytewech was not very active as a painter. Only about ten pictures can be attributed to him, and these were all made during the last seven or eight years of his short life. He had close contact with Frans Hals: according to an old inventory reference, both artists worked on the same picture; they used the same models; and Buytewech even copied some of Hals's works. But he never acquired Hals's fluency or boldness in the use of fat oil paint and he never worked life-size. Compared with Hals, the efforts of Buytewech are tight and his touch is minute. Nevertheless, he painted enough to justify the claim that he established the important category of the 'merry company' in an interior. An excellent example of the type is this painting in Rotterdam.The fat Falstaff type who wears a garland of sausages is the same model who appears in one of Hals's early paintings. Buytewech's work already shows the early Baroque phase of Dutch painting. The figures are depicted close to the spectator, with a detailed realism. The colours have become bright and show a bit of a plein-air effect, although there is too much local colour - particularly pinks, yellows, and blues - to produce complete unity and harmony.Buytewech was not yet the type of narrow specialist who developed in the following generation. His subject matter included religious themes, allegorical motifs disguised as scenes from everyday life, book illustrations, and charming landscapes  as well as genre scenes, all this largely in graphic art

25213-virgo.jpg	This Master of the Virgo inter Virgines, whose names derives from a painting now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, had one of the three most active workshops in Holland at the end of the fifteenth century. The artist certainly possessed an exceptional expressive talent, which is plainly revealed by the intense dramatic force of the scene represented, by the serpentine and tormented line with which the figures are delineated, by the agitated poses and by the agonizing figure of the tortured Christ. Even the range of colours is emotionally charged, the reds, blacks and whites a deliberate clashing accompaniment to the awesome tragedy of Christ's death.Figures like the swooning Virgin who has collapsed upon herself, and Mary Magdalen, have nothing rationally calculated about them; they serve rather to emphasize a dramatic intensity and almost savage, inhuman anguish, reflecting an anticonventional and certainly highly individual temperament.

03974-bello202.jpg	Bellotto painted his first large view of Dresden in 1747, and complemented it a year later with a pendant. Replicas of the two pictures, painted in a smaller format but from his own hand, came also to the Gem&#228;ldegalerie in 1778.The panorama of the city, shown in this picture, was to become the classic view of Dresden, seen approximately from the level of the Japanische Palais: the right-hand side of the painting is dominated by the Catholic Hofkirche, shining in its light shades and intensified by its reflection in the river. Although the tower had not yet been finished, Bellotto faked it after inspecting the architect's plans. Behind the Hofkirche we see parts of the royal residence, including the lofty Hausmannsturm, which seems to rest on the roof of the Hofkirche. The Augustusbr�cke as designed by Matthias Daniel Poppelmann sweeps across the Elbe, and acts as it were as the plinth for the buildings that form the Br�hlsche Terrasse behind: the palace of Anton Egon von Fiirstenberg, who ruled Dresden whenever Augustus the Strong was away in Poland, followed by the Palais Br�hl with its tall windows in the form of semicircular arches, and then the Br�hlsche Bibliothek and the Gem&#228;ldegalerie of Count Br�hl, Prime Minister to Augustus III. Rising up directly behind them is the majestic dome of the Protestant Frauenkirche, designed by George Bahr, newly built but already an integral part of Dresden's skyline.The precision of Bellotto's vedute makes it easy to forget their carefully calculated compositions. The way the river forms a diagonal, or the bank in the foreground a wedge shape, or the building on the far left acts as a link between picture and frame: all accord with specific rules and conventions that developed from landscape painting. Bellotto adds a number of incidental figures, most strikingly an impoverished family at the front left who have settled outside a simple wooden hut

31178-9exal01.jpg	The last episode of the cycle is in the lunette of the east wall. Heraclius wished to bring the cross back to Jerusalem after  his victory over the heathen. When he tried to enter the city through the very gate Christ had used, the stones fell down and blocked his way. An angel then told him that he would have to walk barefoot, carrying the cross in humility, as Christ did. Heraclius followed the angel's advice, whereupon  the stones sprang back into place, the gate was opened, and he was then able to return the cross to its proper place. In Piero's cycle the scene is presented in a somewhat different version. Heraclius, barefoot, has carried the cross up to the walls of Jerusalem. There he and his train are met by a group of men who kneel down before the cross in veneration.The figure of the Emperor is almost entirely illegible now. The Oriental noblemen wear splendid Greek headdresses, the exotic elegance of them had been admired by all Florentines at the time. Piero's interest in these enormous hats, cylindrical or pyramidal in shape, is dictated by the same motives which had driven Paolo Uccello to concentrate on the complex armour of contemporary warriors - the study of shapes and perspective.And the colours of the garments are more lively, too. In the midday light and under the blue sky, they vary from pale blue to violet, from bottle-green to pearl-white. This scene is the confirmation that Piero wishes to depict an ideal mankind, healthy and strong, with a peaceful expression, characterized by calm, measured gestures. He conveys the impression of a race of mature men, rationally at peace with themselves

31159-8herac01.jpg	In the year 615, the Persian King Chosroes steals the wood, setting it up as an object of worship. The Eastern Emperor Heraclius wages war on the Persian King and, having defeated him, returns to Jerusalem with the Holy Wood.The battle of Heraclius and Chosroes has little of the luminary magic of the battle of Constantine and Maxentius, perhaps because of its situation on a wall which never receives direct light. Piero includes no landscape, concentrating instead on the battle. He may have been guided in part by Roman battle sarcophagi, seen in Florence and Pisa, in which the compositional field is completely filled with interwoven figures in conflict. The motif of the horse rearing over a fallen enemy is common in Roman sculpture.In representing the episode Piero has chosen to represent the grim mechanics of the slaughter: there are no beautiful patterns, no lovely light, and the armour has little allure. The legs of horses and people fill the lower part of the composition, while above masses of steel and flesh collide. There are incidents of utter brutality, as when a soldier near the throne jabs his dagger into the throat of another, or of pathos, as we watch the dying figure below the rearing horse. The dethroned monarch on the far right awaits the executioner's sword. Above him the True Cross is blasphemously incorporated into his throne.

08660-10draugh.jpg	A young man with a pigtail and a tricorn hat stands at a table sharpening with a knife a crayon in a holder. Before him on a drawing-board lies a half-finished sketch of a bearded man. The same youthful model is to be found in other paintings by Chardin, such as the House of Cards in the National Gallery in London and a similar picture in the Oskar Reinhart collection in Winterthur. The individual features of the sitter and the half-length treatment give the picture the character of a portrait, which was not, however, the artist's intention. Chardin's interest lay in the commonplace, in the aesthetic values of everyday life, which he - like Vermeer - brings out in the still-life posture of those he portrayed.Chardin was received into the Paris Academy in 1728 as an animal and fruit painter. During the 1730s he produced a series of half-length portrayals of children, busily engaged at a table, in the style of The Draughtsman. Following the success of the latter, he produced a second version, which - signed and dated 1737 like the Berlin picture - is now in the Louvre. In 1738 The Draughtsman - which of the two versions is not certain was exhibited in the Paris Salon and in 1940 a mezzotint print by J. Faber brought it to the notice of a wider public.Chardin's work is in striking contrast to the courtly art of his contemporaries, Boucher and Fragonard. In spite of that, or perhaps because of it, he met with considerable success. In a certain sense his pictures represented a bourgeois world, which had grown tired of the cultural domination of the Court. The mere choice of subject satisfied a need for a simpler and more natural life - another component of the age of gallantry - and at the same time, managed to come up to the highest standards of painting.In 1779 this painting was in Unter den Linden, the Berlin palace of Prince Henry, a brother of Frederick II. It may be identical with a picture of Chardin's which the king is known to have bought in 1747 in Paris through Count Rothenburg. The painting, which documentary evidence shows to have been in palaces at Potsdam during the nineteenth century, remained in the possession of the former royal house after the fall of the monarchy and was purchased in 193I for the Berlin Gallery

29870-virtue2.jpg	Van Orley, court painter to the regent Margaret of Austria, was active during the short interval when the notion of the antique was just coming into being. Significantly, his architectural constructions fall mostly in the period from the late 1510s through the 1520s, a period between the unchallenged authority of an international Late Gothic manner and the introduction of antique forms into built architecture. Highly ornate forms were prized at the time for their delicacy and intricacy. Van Orley's triptych of Virtue of Patience (called also Job Triptych) typifies this visually abundant manner. The pavilion housing the children of Job, in the central panel, is supported by rich piers formed of quadruple joined colonnettes and decorated with medallions, rams' heads, and garlands

The paintings represent the life-size figures of Adam and Eve from the scene of the Fall. They appear to have belonged to a series consisting of four nudes, and it is recorded that in 1641 four paintings by Hans Baldung, representing Adam, Eve, Judith and Venus, found their way from Strasbourg into the possession of a Basel merchant. The full-length Judith, now in the Germanisches Museum in Nuremberg, and the Venus in the Kroller-Muller Museum at Otterlo are panels of the same structure and dimensions as the pictures in Budapest and, since the former is dated 1524, it may be assumed that the whole series, including the two pictures in Budapest, was painted in that year.The artist created a strong contrast between the figures Adam and Eve.

28864-01moriso.jpg	Berthe Morisot was the daughter of a top-ranking civil servant and the great-niece of the eminent Rococo painter Jean-Honor� Fragonard. With her sister Edma she had taken private tuition, mainly from Corot, and from 1864 on she regularly exhibited landscapes at the Salon. The present double portrait shows her mother reading and her sister Edma on a settee listening or thinking. The picture was not only reminiscent of Manet's Reading but was in fact so heavily reworked by him (she now regarded Manet as her teacher) that she withdraw it from the 1870 Salon, where it had been accepted - no longer feeling sure of it

The painting can be considered as part of a Neo-Venetian movement that evolved in Rome between 1625 and 1635-1640, stimulated by the presence of the Bacchanals by Titian, originally in the collection of Alfonso I d'Este but which were brought to Rome in 1598

41292-08flagel.jpg	The panel once decorated the outside of the wing of an altar.Stylisticallty it is a problematic work. The emphasis on the cruel details of The Flagellation is in keeping with the period indicated by the date, but the style is based on a mixture of elements taken from D�rer and the Danube School; the colours are as bright as those of Albrecht Altdorfer or Wolf Huber. These characteristics are enhanced by unrestrained animation. The figures seem to be unable to move in the low, squat space filled with an unnecessarily large number of columns, so that their gestures seem all the more violent. The columns suggest a grand portico, rather than a torture chamber; the head of a person lurking in the left upper corner could be that of the proconsul himself. At the beginning of the sixteenth century columns were a rarity in architecture north of the Alps; for this reason, they did not often figure in paintings. Thus their presence here adds an element of grandeur to the chamber, giving it a more contemporary Italianate appearance. At the same time, however, the queer, ring-shaped ornaments appearing at intervals on the stem of the columns, make them look awkward and primitive

44758-bonavent.jpg	"The church of the Franciscan college San Buenaventura in Seville was adorned by a narrative cycle on the life of St Bonaventura, the renovator of the Franciscan order. Between 1626 and 1628 Herrera painted the four scenes describing the saint's youth, placed on the left wall of the nave; Zurbar�n was commissioned to complete the cycle, and executed four canvases illustrating the end of the saint's life.Dressed in the brilliant white robes of a bishop, grasping the cross in his folded hands, the body of the saint lies in state on a bier draped in sumptuous brocade, with the red biretta of the cardinal at his feet. Pope Gregory X, who had appointed him cardinal bishop of Albano in 1273 stands, a white bearded man, beside the king, to whom he appears to be explaining the merits of the dead man. Most of the mourners, however, are simple Franciscan monks in their greyish brown habits, pensively praying or meditatively contemplating the dead man. He is indeed one of them, and the wan complexion of his tranquil face appears to mirror the dull hue of the habits. The great scholar and administrator of his order is here placed between the representatives of ecclesiastical and worldly power and the world of simple Franciscan brotherhood. He was accorded the title of ""doctor seraphicus"", meaning the ""brilliant teacher full of love"". This is what Zurbar�n paints: the teacher bound to practical life, his face filled with mystical desire even in death"

06219-colonna.jpg	"The painting is signed and dated on the base of the column, where the inscription reads, ""STE. COUMNA II. IL BRO(N)ZI(NO) FLO. FAC. MDXLUI"". The date of 1546 would lead one to place the painting at the period of Bronzino's Roman sojourn. Likewise, the influences of Sebastiano del Piombo and Michelangelo, evident in this portrait, point to Rome. Nevertheless, the prototype for the portrait type of the military commander can be found in Titian's portrait of Guidubaldo della Rovere in the Galleria Palatina (Palazzo Pitti) in Florence. Bronzino's Colonna assumes the same pose as the sitter in the 1530 della Rovere portrait. The hypothesis that Bronzino executed the painting in Florence was confirmed as fact in 1981.Colonna, though a Roman, served Duke Cosimo I de' Medici as lieutenant general of the Tuscan army. He was, moreover, a member (as was Bronzino himself) of the Florentine Academy. Colonna died in Pisa in March of 1548, and on the twentieth of that month he received the tribute of an honorary funeral in the church of San Lorenzo in Florence. The written accounts of this ceremony record that a portrait of the deceased was present: it must have been the one executed by Bronzino. The beautiful frame carries carved symbols that pertain to the art of war and allude to the sitter's qualities as a military commander"

24627-tondo.jpg	Around 1500, when the port of Antwerp began to emerge as the capital of north European trade, it also became a cultural melting pot. All manner of artists flocked into the town on the Scheldt. One of these was Quentin Massys from Louvain, who registered as a painter in the St. Lucas Guild in 1491, and is regarded as the founder of the Antwerp School which was soon to topple the hegemony of the School of Bruges. He remained faithful to the Flemish tradition, although the sfumato in the background of some of his landscapes shows that he was familiar with the work of Leonardo da Vinci. He is usually regarded as a painter of monumental works, and rightly so, but he also painted smaller scale scenes with figures. This is hardly surprising, since his technique had its sources in miniature paintings. The Holy Virgin with the Child Jesus, a small tondo, bears witness to the attention the master paid to sensitive, finely detailed drawing to express the tender movement of the form, and the subtle use of colour to convey the essence of a variety of textures

35753-3morning.jpg	To the seventeenth-century German mystic Jacob Boehme, Runge owed the concept that flowers can symbolize different human states. With their cycle from first bud to death, their response to light, and as manifestations of God's purpose on earth, flowers were for Runge the most revealing of all natural forms. Together with small children and musical instruments they formed the allegorical base of his most ambitious work, a series on the theme of Times of Day. This was intended to take the form of four huge oil paintings, and to be experienced in a Gothic chapel to the music of choirs and poetry by his friend the writer Ludwig Tieck. This grand plan never materialized; the designs were published in some rather unsatisfactory engravings in 1806 and 1807, while only one of the four subjects, Morning, was developed in oil, in two versions (the larger was later cut into fragments, having failed to satisfy the painter himself).The painting represents a supreme statement of the nature mysticism associated with the Romantic movement, and is undoubtedly the masterpiece of Runge's short life. He began work on it in Dresden, where he had been greatly moved by Raphael's Sistine Madonna in the picture gallery, and his tightly structured, vertical compositions have some of the qualities of altarpieces. As in the earlier Nightingale's Lesson, they are surrounded by hieroglyphic borders, combining Christian and mythological symbolism. Individual plants, minutely scrutinized like botanical specimens, are integrated into visionary patterns. In Morning, Runge was able to incorporate his researches into colour theory, based on association and the revelatory power of light. The small version contains a passage of sublimely lovely pure landscape painting &#151; the summer meadow on whose carpet of flowers a baby wakes at dawn

The solemn equilibrium, the quality of repose and grandeur, the supreme elegance of this scene illustrating the Rest during the Flight into Egypt, classically framed by the high step and the two pilasters, but laid out in an unconventional manner, make this fresco one of the loftiest achievements of the late phase of Andrea's art.

Lega developed an overriding interest in effects of light, an interest he expressed in the plein-air nature studies he painted around Piagentina after 1861. He also painted simple genre idylls which used loving detail to record the everyday lives of ordinary rural folk.

03860-137alle3.jpg	The four panels with Allegories at the Accademia in Venice are often likened to the Sacred Allegory, but they belong instead to the artist's scanty secular production. They originally formed part of a small dressing-table with a mirror and a rack on which to hang objects, belonging to the painter Vincenzo Catena who, writing his will in 1530, left it to Antonio Marsili. The spread of this kind of furniture was so great that in 1489 the Venetian Senate prohibited its manufacture, limiting it to what was strictly necessary. Often, as in this instance, their decoration comprised symbolic representations of a moralistic character.An unusual theme for Bellini, the panels represent respectively: Lust tempting the virtuous man or Perseverance (Bacchus who from a chariot offers a plate of fruit to a warrior); fickle Fortune (the woman on an unstable boat holding a sphere); Prudence (the naked woman pointing at a mirror); Falsehood (the man emerging from the shell). There are diverging opinions about the interpretation of the last two representations, such that they have been seen as: the Woman as Vanitas (on the basis of similar representations by Jacopo de' Barbari and Baldung Grien), and the Man in the shell as an allegory of Virtus Sapientia, since the shell might have a positive connotation as a generative principle.

19699-fruitflo.jpg	"Tom�s Hiepes lived and worked in Valencia, where he enjoyed considerable local fame as a still-life and flower painter. His Still-Life with Fruit and Flowers, reflecting his ability in still-life painting, represents a Delft bowl of fruit and two pottery vases with gilt mounts containing jasmine flowers resting on a table covered by a tablecloth decorated with fine lacework known at the time as ""Milan lace."" This painting allows a full appreciation of Hiepes's style in his early maturity, characterised by his attention to fine detail, his use of glazes in modelling the fruit and subtle effects of colour and lighting. The painting is signed and dated 1642 in large letters on the reverse of the canvases and is - together with its pendant in the same collection - the earliest dated works known by the artist.The painting attests to the particular skills of Hiepes in still-life and flower painting, leavened with an ingenuous charm entirely of his own that makes his works among the most appealing of those painted in 17th-century Spain"

15122-self_por.jpg	In this unusual self-portrait the artist portrays himself laughing as he sits at his easel painting a portrait of an unlovely old lady. Why is he laughing? Albert Blankert persuasively argued that he has depicted himself as the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis who laughed so hard while painting the portrait of a funny old crone that he choked and died. The tale of Zeuxis's demise is found in a Roman source dated about 200 AD and was repeated by both van Mander (1604) and Hoogstraten (1678). De Gelder's Frankfurt painting was conceivably done in emulation of Rembrandt's Self-Portrait at Cologne which shows the old master laughing. X-rays and technical investigation reveal that Rembrandt may also have portrayed himself as Zeuxis laughing as he painted a portrait of an ugly old woman

07615-67sheph.jpg	While in Messina, Caravaggio was contracted to paint four scenes of the Passion. If he finished any of them, nothing now survives. This nativity scene, Susinno says, was ordered by the Senate of Messina for the Capuchin church of Santa Maria degli Angeli. A Franciscan simplicity pervades it: in the wooden barn a donkey and an ox stand patiently at the back, there is straw on the floor and in a basket the Holy Family have a loaf of bread, the carpenter's tools of Joseph and some pieces of cloth. Joseph (in red) introduces the shepherds, in brown and grey, to the young Virgin Mother, whose dress is a brighter red. Mary cuddles her baby peacefully and, apart from two haloes, only the bare-shouldered young man, who kneels with clasped hands, gives the moment of the child's discovery a hint of its meaning. God became man as one of the poor. Ironically, for this canvas Caravaggio received 1000 scudi, the highest amount mentioned in any accounts of his career

37838-venus_ad.jpg	At the end of the 16th century the court of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague was one of the most important art and cultural centre of Europe. The Emperor gathered together important artists: painters, sculptors, goldsmiths, who developed a characteristic style as important as that of the Fontainebleau school flowered at the same period in France. One component of the Rudolphean style was the painting of the Flemish Spranger, another the German Hans von Aachen and the third the Swiss Joseph Heintz.Spranger was in Paris at the age of nineteen with Primaticcio and Niccol&#242; dell'Abbate. He worked in Parma, where Correggio and Parmigianino influenced him, then he spent eight years in Rome and in 1575 arrived to the court of Maximillian II and became court painter of Rudolph II in 1581.Venus and Adonis is a late work by Spranger, a masterpiece of the Rudolphean Mannerism

15213-franci.jpg	This devotional image of St Francis, dressed in a Capuchin habit, has been associated with Gentileschi's deposition in the libel suit brought by Giovanni Baglione in 1603 against four rival artists, including Gentileschi and Caravaggio. Gentileschi testified that Caravaggio had borrowed from him a Capuchin habit and pair of wings, which quite plausibly can be identified with the costumes in this picture. In the decades immediately following the Council of Trent (1545-63), an increased emphasis was placed on the depiction of the mystical experiences of saints rather than more traditional narrative sequences from their lives.Here St Francis, who has collapsed in an ecstatic swoon after receiving the stigmata, is consoled by his guardian angel. The composition recalls scenes of the Saviour comforted by an angel on the Mount of Olives, transforming St Francis into an analogue of Christ. Such meditational images were meant to inspire the viewer to contemplate his own death and rebirth through Christian devotion. Gentileschi treated the theme a number of times, including a version (Galleria d'Arte Antica di Palazzo Barberini, Rome) which was installed in the oratory of San Girolamo della Carit&#224; around 1611. This latter work is more Caravaggesque in its handling of light and shade and in its spatial complexity, suggesting that it was painted slightly after the Prado version (it was most likely moved to the oratory in 1611 from another venue). In both pictures the nearly full-length figures are pushed towards the picture plane, but in the Barberini version the saint's body falls forward and the angel swivels in space, creating a more dramatic and emotionally packed image. The palette, too, has been altered from the warm reds and golds of the angel's tunic in the Prado picture to a more lyrical combination of pink, rose and white.

19509-entombm1.jpg	Maerten van Heemskerck probably produced this imposing triptych for a church in Delft. It is a mature work, and one of the artist's most accomplished paintings. The central panel represents the entombment according to a traditional pattern, with Christ's gnarled body, placed on a brilliant white winding cloth, taking up alone almost the entire foreground. It is supported by Joseph of Arimathea to the right and by Nicodemus and Mary Magdalene to the left. The Saviour's face is ghastly pale and carries the marks of the crown of thorns, that now lies at the foot of the tomb. However, the promise of his forthcoming resurrection figures on the bas-relief of the sarcophagus, which illustrates the story of Jonah, whose three days in the belly of the whale are considered as prefiguring Christ's three days in the tomb. Around the central group we find the usual protagonists, St John and the Virgin, Mary Salome and Mary Cleophas, to the far right, a servant carries a vase of perfume for embalming Christ's body. Their gestures are tense, their faces distorted with grief.A similar sense of sadness marks their holy patrons Peter and Mary Magdalene who accompany the donors in prayer on the wings. The reverse sides of the wings are decorated with the majestic figures of the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah.The triptych illustrates profusely how much Van Heemskerck was marked by his stay in Italy, where he lived in Rome from 1532 to 1536-37 and was constantly drawing antique monuments, ruins and sculptures. Joseph of Arimathea's face picks up the expression of the famous Laocoon, of whom the artist has left us a sketch, whilst the sarcophagus is inspired directly from Roman models. Christ's monumental figure, with its powerful muscles, also betrays clear influences of Michelangelo and the Italian mannerists.The Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem conserves a triptych by Van Heemskerck, the central panel of which shows the Mocking of Christ, another episode of the Passion, probably intended for the same chapel as the Brussels altarpiece. Indeed the work carries the same dates and is of identical shape and size. In addition, the backs of the wings depict the prophets Ezekiel and Daniel, who, together with Isaiah and Jeremiah, prefigure the four evangelists

08301-sorrows.jpg	This panel, probably intended for private devotion, shows the dead Christ as a half-length figure standing in the sarcophagus in a manner typical of icon painting.A lavishly embroidered cloth lines the sarcophagus, an allusion to the altar covering. In the panel the painter combines a finely worked gold ground with attempts at three-dimensional presentation. The richly ornamented frame contains eight round medallions with portraits of saints that look like miniature icons. Ceccarelli placed his signature conspicuously on the front of the sarcophagus

40926-01adorat.jpg	In comparison with other artistic centres, Antwerp had relatively little tradition in art in the beginning of the 16th century: but it was fertile ground ready to receive the seeds of new ideas brought by the many artists who flocked to the town on the Scheldt from other towns in the Low Countries. This burgeoning artistic life yielded religious works based on iconographic and compositional formulae derived from foreign examples. Moreover, the Low Countries' own traditional church based art had reached a crisis, and signs could already be seen heralding the advent of a different type of painting all together, with the birth of the Italian Renaissance. The economic and social revolution which transformed the needs and demands of art lovers resulted in a much looser relationship between artist and patron. Artists no longer felt obliged to bow to specific requirements as to the form or content of the painting imposed by the patron or institution commissioning it. Instead, they began to feel that their responsibility was rather to satisfy the tenets of taste held by nameless international artistic circles in which they moved. Thus an art market was created. Artists began to specialise, made life easier for themselves by repeating certain motifs over and over again, and aimed to create a certain effect. The anonymous Adoration of the Magi is an admirable example of the most popular subject of these artists, who are known as the Antwerp Mannerists. Strutting vanity and late Gothic and Renaissance decorations are depicted in sharp contrast with quiet modesty

12244-verso01.jpg	The picture shows one of the 26 narrative scenes from the Stories of the Passion on the reverse side of the Maest&#224;. It is situated in the bottom left corner of the main section.The scene depicts Christ riding on a donkey up to the city-gate of Jerusalem. Crowds of enthusiastic people are preparing a fitting welcome for him, as they lay down branches and clothes in his path.The scene is unusual because of the attention given to the landscape, which is rich in detail. The paved road, the city gate with battlements, the wall embrasures, the slender towers rising up above and the polygonal building of white marble reproduce a remarkably realistic layout, both urbanistically and architecturally. The small tree, withered and leafless, that shows behind Christ's halo, is the fig-tree that Christ found without fruit. Florens Deuchler has suggested that the literary source is a historical work of the first century A.D., the De Bello Judaico by Flavius Josephus which was well-known in the Middle Ages. The panel by Duccio is a faithful reproduction of the description of Jerusalem in Book V. Infrared photography during restoration has revealed several changes of mind regarding the area around the tree in the centre and the road

It contains Apollo on the Sun-Chariot and the Four Corners of the World. With great ingenuity Tiepolo overcame the extremely unfavourable proportions for a fresco painting (21,5 x 5,5 m) by placing the few groups of Olympian gods far apart on dramatic banks of clouds, saving the centre of the ceiling for Apollo and his sun-chariot. Groupings above the cornices of the long walls representing the four corners of the world serve as framing accents for the bizarre compositions above the end walls

44463-road_fo.jpg	Like many Haarlem landscape painters, Wynants was inspired by the dunes near to his native city. His large dune paintings are often conceived in deliberately contrasting masses, arranged on either side of a road leading into the picture.

17980-04scene.jpg	"The last picture in the bottom row shows the Meeting of St Francis and St Dominic. Benozzo starts with the vision of St Dominic in the left half of the picture. Christ is about to hurl three spears - the symbols of pride, unchastity and greed - at the depraved world. Mary is attempting to prevent him by pointing to the meeting taking place between St Dominic and St Francis. The depiction of the saint is derived from the description written by Thomas of Celano in 1228: ""Not particularly large in form; small rather than large, he had a not particularly large, round head, a somewhat long and stretched face, a level and low forehead, not particularly large black, pure eyes, dark hair, straight eyebrows, an even, fine and straight nose, upright, small ears, flat temples (...), close, regular and white teeth, narrow and soft lips, a black, not full beard, a slender neck, straight shoulders, short arms, gentle hands, long fingers.""For the first time in this cycle St Francis bears a tonsure and is dressed in the simple brown habit of a Franciscan, with a cord as a belt. This plain habit clearly distinguishes him from St Dominic, whose habit is a white tunic with a white scapular with a dark cape over it. In contrast with the rather more lavish Dominican attire, St Francis' simple habit refers to the ideal of poverty to which he dedicated himself for the rest of his life.The two founders of orders met in Rome, as indicated by the obelisks which appear on the left side of the church. Benozzo places the scene, which according to legend took place in 1215, in front of a church, presumably Old St Peter's. This scene is not drawn from the legend of St Francis but from the life of St Dominic in the ""Legenda Aurea"" (Golden Legend).The accompanying inscription reads: QUANDO BEATA VIRGO OSTE(N)DIT XPO BEATU(M) FRANCISCU(M) ET BEATU(M) DOMINICU(M) PRO REPARATIONE MUNDI - ""How the blessed Virgin pointed St Francis and St Dominic out to Christ, for the renewal of the world.""

14437-204fried.jpg	In a letter of 22 June 1811, written by Friederike Volkmann in Dresden to the psychologist Dr Christian August Heinroth in Leipzig, this painting is described as the pendant to the Winter Landscape now in Schwerin.The Schwerin painting is characterized by the sombreness of an expanse of snow stretching away into the infinite distance, which modern interpreters see as a symbol of death, a nihilistic sign of doom. The pendant in Dortmund introduces, for the first time in Friedrich's oeuvre, a Gothic church, seen as a monumental vision emerging out of the mist like a phantasmagoria and rising against the gloomy background of a winter sky. Nearer the viewer, a man is leaning back against a boulder and gazing up the crucifix in front of a cluster of young fir trees. He has flung his crutches demonstratively far away from him into the snow. This combination of motifs has been interpreted as a reference to the security of the Christian in his faith.

39593-2pesaro01.jpg	Titian was neither such a universal scholar as Leonardo, nor such an outstanding personality as Michelangelo, nor such a versatile and attractive man as Raphael. He was principally a painter, but a painter whose handling of paint equalled Michelangelo's mastery of draughtsmanship. This supreme skill enabled him to disregard all the time-honoured rules of composition, and to rely on colour to restore the unity which he apparently broke up.We need but look at Madonna with Saints and Members of the Pesaro Family which was begun only some fifteen years after Giovanni Bellini's San Zaccaria Altarpiece to realize the effect which his art must have had on contemporaries. It was almost unheard of to move the Holy Virgin out of the centre of the picture, and to place the two administering saints - St Francis, who is recognizable by the Stigmata (the wounds of the Cross), and St Peter, who has deposited the key (emblem of his dignity) on the steps of the Virgin's throne - not symmetrically on each side, as Giovanni Bellini had done, but as active participants of a scene.In this altar-painting, Titian had to revive the tradition of donors' portraits, but did it in an entirely novel way. The picture was intended as a token of thanksgiving for a victory over the Turks by the Venetian nobleman Jacopo Pesaro, and Titian portrayed him kneeling before the Virgin while an armoured standard-bearer drags a Turkish prisoner behind him. St Peter and the Virgin look down on him benignly while St Francis, on the other side, draws the attention of the Christ Child to the other members of the Pesaro family, who are kneeling in the corner of the picture. The whole scene seems to take place in an open courtyard, with two giant columns which rise into the clouds where two little angels are playfully engaged in raising the Cross.Titian's contemporaries may well have been amazed at the audacity with which he had dared to upset the old-established rules of composition. They must have expected, at first, to find such a picture lopsided and unbalanced. Actually it is the opposite. The unexpected composition only serves to make it gay and lively without upsetting the harmony of it all. The main reason is the way in which Titian contrived to let light, air and colours unify the scene. The idea of making a mere flag counterbalance the figure of the Holy Virgin would probably have shocked an earlier generation, but this flag, in its rich, warm colour, is such a stupendous piece of painting that the venture was a complete success.

15932-concert.jpg	"This work is one of the mysteries of European painting: in spite of its undeniable quality and epochal importance, opinions are divergent concerning both its creator and its theme. It is the outstanding masterpiece of the Venetian Renaissance, the summit of Giorgione's creative career, so much so that according to some it may have been painted, or at least finished, by Titian rather than Giorgione.The painting has been interpreted as an allegory of Nature, similar to Giorgione's Storm, which was undeniably painted by him; it was even viewed as the first example of the modern herdsman genre. Its message must be more complex than this. It is likely that the master consciously unified several themes in this painting, and the deciphering of symbols required a degree of erudition even at the time of its creation. During the eighteenth century the painting was known by the simple name of ""Pastorale"" and only subsequently was it given the title ""F&#234;te champ&#234;tre"" or ""Concert champ&#234;tre"", owing to its festive mood. Modern research has pointed out that the composition is in fact an allegory of poetry.The female figures in the foreground are probably the Muses of poetry, their nakedness reveals their divine being. The standing figure pouring water from a glass jar represents the superior tragic poetry, while the seated one holding a flute is the Muse of the less prestigious comedy or pastoral poetry. The well-dressed youth who is playing a lute is the poet of exalted lyricism, while the bareheaded one is an ordinary lyricist. The painter based this differentiation on Aristotle's ""Poetica"".The scenery is characterized by a duality. Between the elegant, slim trees on the left, we see a multi-levelled villa, while on the right, in a lush grove, we see a shepherd playing a bagpipe. Yet the effect is completely unified. The very presence of the beautiful, mature Muses provides inspiration; the harmony of scenery and figures, colours and forms proclaims the close interrelationship between man and nature, poetry and music."

30892-farnesi0.jpg	After the building was completed the initial focus of the decoration was the garden loggia on the Tiber side of the villa (the Loggia di Galatea). Originally it opened to the landscape on two sides through arcades. The vault of the loggia was decorated by Peruzzi in 1510-11 with a system of architectonic fields painted with deceptive realism that contain a number of mythological figures against a blue sky. The artist based their appearance and form on numerous ancient sculptures. The stories of gods and heroes symbolized constellations, planets, and signs of the zodiac that merge to form a sky like the one that have been seen in 1466 at the hour of Chigi's birth.The twelve signs of the zodiac are distributed above the ten spandrels, to which are added - corresponding to their positions in the sky - the gods of the planets. In the ceiling panel several constellations are emphasized in two large horizontal formats: on the right Ursa Major; on the left Perseus and Pegasus.Peruzzi also frescoed one of the lunettes with a monumental grisaille head - a showpiece of pure expressive artistry. The other lunettes were painted in the fall of 1511 by Sebastiano del Piombo with a number of scenes of metamorphosis from Ovid

07854-06mark.jpg	The quality of Carpaccio's use of colour and his power of expression and invention decreased in his last religious paintings, for the most part executed by his assistants. But in at least two of his late works, where the subject matter stimulated his imagination, Carpaccio returned to the creative levels of his earlier periods.The Lion of St Mark, painted in 1516 for the Magistrato dei Camerlenghi in Rialto and today in the Doges' Palace, is an imposing creation, standing with its hind legs in the water and its forelegs on dry land, one firmly resting on a rocky shore and the other holding up the book with the traditional inscription PAX/TIBI/MAR/CE/E/VANGELI/STA/MEUS. This image symbolizing the power on land and sea of the Venetian Republic is particularly significant if we consider that it was painted just after the Serenissima had run the risk of losing its independence when it was attacked by the League of Cambrai, the coalition of great powers formed in 1509.Behind the symbol of St Mark, portrayed in splendid and triumphant isolation, Carpaccio has given us a view of some of the places where the fortunes of the Serenissima had prospered and grown for more than five centuries. In this extraordinary wide-angled view the artist gives us a perfectly detailed depiction of the basin of St Mark's towards San Nicolo di Lido, all the way to the heart of Venice: the Doges' Palace, St Mark's Basilica, the columns of St Theodore and St Mark, the Piazzetta, the bell-tower and the Clock Tower

19459-garland.jpg	In the 1660s a general tendency towards ennoblement can be observed in Dutch painting across all the genres. De Heem's ambitious composition of a cartouche surrounded by flowers and fruits with a central pictorial field follows the Flemish formula perfected by Daniel Seghers and already employed by Jan Brueghel the Elder and Rubens.William III was born in 1650 and elected Governor of the Netherlands in 1672; from 1689 until his death in 1702 he was King of England. Alongside the oranges, the lion of the Netherlands, the two heraldic eagles, the laurel wreath, the sunflower and the orange lily are all clear references to the status of the sitter as Prince of Orange. The white lily on the other hand, refers to impeccable honesty. The red and white roses symbolize the houses of Lancaster and York, from which William's mother Maria Henrietta Stuart was descended.

21297-01jerome.jpg	Charles II seems to have acquired this painting in 1662. At that time it was listed as 'St. Jerome wth [sic] spectacles of the manner of Albrecht D�rer'; it was not until 1939 that it was recognised by Kenneth Clark as 'a very bad de la Tour'. Saint Jerome reading is now regularly discussed in the literature on the artist, whose popularity has risen dramatically in recent years. Having been born in Lorraine where he passed most of his life, de la Tour's style reveals a commingling of Italian and Northern Caravaggesque influences which suggest, but do not necessarily prove, visits to Rome and the Netherlands. However, his style remains determinedly individual and was equally the product of local influences. He was a man of independent means and was appointed Peintre Ordinaire du Roi in Paris in 1639.There is a limited number of signed or dated works in the artist's small oeuvre and only approximate indications (some controversial) for the development of his style.Saint Jerome reading may be compared with the series of Apostles at Albi (Mus�e Toulouse-Lautrec), usually regarded as early works although not all autograph. The figures of Saint James the Less, Saint Philip and Saint Paul are particularly relevant. Also significant is a variant Saint Jerome reading in Paris, a copy after a lost painting by de la Tour, which is a more sophisticated composition with the figure seen from above and numerous objects comprising a still-life in the foreground. A date of about 1621-23 has been suggested for all of these works, which herald the influence of Caravaggio.Even allowing for the worn surface of the present painting, the chief characteristics of de la Tour's art can be discerned: the naturalistic rendering of hair and skin, the love of genre details such as the spectacles, the splash of saturated colour for the cardinal's robe and, above all, the mysterious light that illuminates the figure so powerfully. As a painter Georges de la Tour lifts the art of scientific observation onto a poetic level. It is not quite certain, for instance, to what degree the intense luminosity renders the paper transparent, but it helps to define the distance between the viewer and Saint Jerome in the picture space while providing a bright focal point on a vertical axis. The concentration that characterises Saint Jerome gradually envelops the viewer to the extent that the internal act of reading becomes synonymous with the external discipline of looking.The painting was cleaned and restored in 1972

19472-table_de.jpg	Jan Davidsz de Heem, who was to win an international reputation as one of the greatest European still-life painters, also spent time in Leiden. The most interesting works he painted during his stay there from the mid-twenties to the early thirties are vanitas still-lifes, mainly comprising piles of old, well-used books that signal the vanity of the scholarly life.In about 1635 he moved to Antwerp and in 1637 became a citizen of the city. Apart from some trips to Utrecht, his native city, he remained active in Antwerp for two decades and then is registered there as a non-resident citizen. His long stay in Antwerp earns him a place in the history of Flemish as well as Dutch art. By the late 1660s de Heem settled in Utrecht where he lived until 1672, the disastrous year that Louis XIV's armies invaded the Netherlands. Then he returned to Antwerp where he was active until his death. According to Sandrart (1675) he left Utrecht for Antwerp because 'there one could have rare fruit of all kinds, large plums, peaches, cherries, oranges, lemons, grapes, and others in finer condition and state of ripeness to draw from life ...' The reason Sandrart offers for his move can be questioned. Is it not possible that de Heem fled to Antwerp to avoid living under the invading French troops?It was during his first years in Antwerp that de Heem found his special province. There he painted his famous flower pieces which occasionally have overt moralizing messages. In Antwerp he made contact with the Flemish Jesuit Daniel Seghers (1590-1661), who, after Jan Brueghel, was the most accomplished south Netherlandish flower painter of the century. Seghers depicted bouquets but his speciality was painting garlands encircling a cartouche with a religious scene, a sculptural image, or a portrait, frequently painted by another artist. De Heem adapted Seghers's cartouche motif and painted hanging garlands as well. The individual blooms in these works are as colourful and as accurately portrayed as Bosschaert's, but they are done with a freer brush, introduce chiaroscuro effects, and have asymmetrical arrangements. The host of de Heem's followers and later flower painters use similar pictorial devices.In Antwerp de Heem also began to paint his celebrated abundant displays on carpet-covered tables piled high with ornate silver platters and baskets of huge, expensive fruit, and glistening lobsters. These works are usually embellished with exquisite trappings, precious metal vessels, and delicate glassware. An outstanding very large, early one at the Louvre (this picture) was in the collection of Louis XIV before 1683. The Dutch call lavish still-lifes of this type 'pronk stilleven' (pronk means sumptuous or ostentatious). The term is traditionally used to categorize overt displays of magnificent banquets and luxury items painted from the mid- to the late decades of the century. De Heem, Willem Kalf, and Abraham van Beyeren were the leading practitioners of the type. Their patrons presumably belonged to the upper echelons of society and made no secret of their expensive tastes.De Heem is one of the rare Dutch artists who captured some of the exuberance of Flemish Baroque painting, and soon after he settled in Antwerp in the 1630s his colouristic splendour rivals that of the native Flemings. The success of his flower pieces and pronk still-lifes won him many pupils and imitators both in Flanders and in the northern Netherlands, and occasionally it is difficult to separate his handfrom works done by his followers. His son Cornelis de Heem (1631-95) can come dangerously close to his father.De Heem's works were also frequently copied during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As late as 1893 Matisse made a close reduced copy (Nice-Cimioz, Mus�e Matisse) after the large composition in the Louvre. He sold the copy, then bought it back and used it as an inspiration for his Variation on a Still Life by de Heem (1915; New York, Museum of Modern Art) which is about the size of the huge original. Though Matisse's Variation on de Heem still shows an unmistakable debt to the Dutch painter's composition, it has been completely translated into his personal style of these years
