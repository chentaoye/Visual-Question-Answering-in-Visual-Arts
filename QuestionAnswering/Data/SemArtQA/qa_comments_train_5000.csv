As if he had clambered up the mountain behind father and son, the angel brings them the ram, and speaks to Abraham, who is already relaxing his grip on Isaac's hair. Whether this colorful picture, with its rich lighting, was really painted by Caravaggio, is open to doubt.This painting came to light in the 1980s. It was attributed to Caravaggio, but the attribution has yet to gain wide support. The painting's figural style and pictorial execution are closely related to the St John the Baptist in Toledo, a work which is alternatively attributed to Bartolomeo Cavarozzi

30354-madonna.jpg	Paolo Veneziano, the first great identifiable artist in the history of Venetian painting, was clearly well-acquainted with Byzantine traditions. Indeed he seemed to need to go back to the anachronistic world of Byzantine art to find a means of expression for the most sincere insights of his poetic vision though he must also have been aware of the great advances being made in western art, particulary by the Tuscan masters Giovanni Pisano and Giotto whose work he would have seen at the Scrovegni Chapel in nearby Padua.The Madonna and Child with two Votaries still in its original red and blue notched frame is a good example of Paolo's personal blending of mainland art with the iconic and aulic idioms of Byzantine tradition. The resulting image is completely oriental in feeling. The Virgin sits rigid on the throne and holds out the Child for the adoration of the devotees. The Child is surrounded by a blue mandorla in accordance with a Syrian iconographic schema. But the liveliness of the drawing of the sacred and human figures in the background makes them stand out from their gold setting in a way which is not entirely untypical of the stiff, wooden figures which populate the work of contemporary painters of religious images working in the Veneto-Byzantine style. Thus the artist brings together western formal components and Byzantine compositional schemes in his personal vision of colour

12565-1pear.jpg	The Virgin and Child was D�rer's favourite subject for paintings and no doubt highly popular with patrons. Mary, dressed in a rich blue robe and set against a dark background, gazes down adoringly at her baby. Her veil almost touches the child's head, following its contours. The Virgin's thumb and finger at the bottom of the picture emphasize the fragility of the child's body. Jesus holds the top half of a neatly sliced pear which his mother has cut for him. He has already taken a small bite with the two tiny upper teeth which have just begun to grow. This is a harmonious picture, in terms of colour, composition and subject-matter.A refined variety of details encircle the delicate face of the Virgin: the curls, the veil, and the ribbon across the forehead. The drawing of the eyes and eyebrows is sharp, and the red lips are well defined. Bowing her head tenderly toward her child and bestowing on him an extremely sweet smile, she presents him to the spectator. He lies on a sky-blue cloth, under which she hides her hands so as not to touch him, as one would not touch a precious jewel.There has always been much discussion about the difference between the delicateness of Maria's face and the robust plasticity of the Herculean body of the child, likewise, about the differences in the pictorial technique adopted for each one: a much more physical depiction of the child than the mother. Much has been said about the marked torsion in the body of the little boy, which is splendid both in terms of formal and chromatic considerations. Other similar examples exist in D�rer's paintings and drawings (Madonna and Child with a Pear in the Uffizi, Florence). But no one, until now, has tried to resolve the meaning of the painting, or the presence of the cut pear ostentatiously presented by the child. His limpid and open gaze knowingly peers into the far distance.The pear as an attribute of Christ and Maria is not rare in Venetian painting of the Renaissance, and it appears in all Italian painting; following an interpretation of Bernardo di Chiaravalle of the Cantico dei Cantici, the sweetness of the taste symbolizes the sweetness of mouth and heart, which are, according to Saint Bonaventure, the gifts of the wise. Even D�rer depicted it (1509) in the middle of other fruits in a basket at Maria's feet, in the drawing of the Holy Family under the Loggia. The unusual fact in this painting is that the pear in the child's hand is cut and bitten into. However, wisdom and sweetness are certainly the principal themes of this delightful small devotional image

05278-5parhell.jpg	The two panels once were the left and right wings of a triptych.The greatest Netherlandish artist of the period is not found among the adherents of the New Style but among those who, like Grunewald in Germany, refused to be drawn into the modern movement from the South. In the Dutch town of 's Hertogenbosch there lived such a painter, who was called Hieronymous Bosch. Very little is known about him. We do not know how old he was when he died in 1516, but he must have been active for a considerable time since he became an independent master in 1486. Like Grunewald, Bosch showed that the traditions and achievements of painting which had been developed to represent reality most convincingly could be turned round, as it were, to give us an equally plausible picture of things no human eye had seen. He became famous for his terrifying representations of the powers of evil. Perhaps it is no accident that the gloomy King Philip II of Spain, later in the century, had a special predilection for this artist, who was so much concerned with man's wickedness. These two pictures show two wings from one of Bosch's triptychs Philip bought and which is therefore still in Spain.On the left we watch evil invading the world. The creation of Eve is followed by the temptation of Adam and both are driven out of Paradise, while high above in the sky we see the fall of the rebellious angels, who are hurled from heaven as a swarm of repulsive insects. On the other wing we are shown a vision of hell. There we see horror piled upon horror, fires and torments and all manner of fearful demons, half animal, half human or half machine, who plague and punish the poor sinful souls for all eternity. For the first and perhaps for the only time, an artist had succeeded in giving concrete and tangible shape to the fears that had haunted the minds of man in the Middle Ages. It was an achievement which was perhaps only possible at this very moment, when the old ideas were still vigorous and yet the modern spirit had provided the artist with methods of representing what he saw. Perhaps Hieronymus Bosch could have written on one of his paintings of hell what Jan van Eyck wrote on his peaceful scene of the Arnolfinis' betrothal: 'I was there'

00679-the_annu.jpg	The painting was mentioned by Vasari as being the lunette of a picture which, after various wanderings passed to the museum of Berlin and was destroyed there in the Second World War. It had in fact the form of a lunette and was transformed to a rectangle at an unknown period. It is a late painting of Andrea.In a supremely poetic range of changing colours, from yellow to pink to lilac to purple, it expresses Andrea's new taste, no longer favouring the intense and highly charged palette of the preceding years; he now chooses delicate harmonies, without dissonances, and of precious and refined accords which give the composition a new balance, more quiet and refined than before

35640-07euchar.jpg	This picture shows one of the designs for the set of tapestries of the Triumph of the Eucharist. This series, too, was a royal commission, though here it was not royal absolutism which was glorified but the Church of Rome. The commission came from Archduchess Isabella, who ordered the set for the church of the Poor Clares' convent of the Descalzas Reales in Madrid.In the designs illusionist elements were employed, blurring the distinction between the viewer's own sphere of reality and fiction: the pictures are presented on canvases painted in trompe l'oeil, suspended by cherubs in an equally fictitious painted architectural frame. Each of the eleven 'tapestries within tapestries' shows a picture allegorizing, explaining and glorifying the Eucharist

04222-madonna.jpg	"This small painting, also referred to as ""Madonna delle rose"" once belonged to the church of S. Domenico in Sanseverino. It was originally a wooden panel, with this scene exhibited on one side and a depiction of the Resurrection, with Christ surrounded by angels, on the other and the open tomb underneath (now in Museo della Ca'd'Oro, Venice). In the 19th century the panel was separated in two parts. In the painting, the patron saint of the town of Sanseverino is kneeling on the left, dressed in his episcopal clothing. Saint Dominic, to whom the church is dedicated, kneels on the right, dressed in the habit of his order. The saints are depicted not only in the act of venerating the Madonna and the child, but they also take an active part in supporting with their hands a rose-decorated plate on which the Madonna is seated. Four angels hold a baldachin above the head of the Madonna. The tall angels are dressed in elaborate clothes and are shown in various poses, similar to contemporary examples by Pietro Perugino, Luca Signorelli, or Filippino Lippi"

19206-73noasse.jpg	In the early seventeenth century portraiture became the predominant and most flourishing branch of painting in Holland; after the heroic struggle for national independence the Dutch merchants, who had laid the foundation of the country' wealth, were disposed to have their portraits painted - singly or in groups - for presentation to their families, their heirs or some society.In Frans Hals's work we can see almost every type of portrait: full-length, half-length, group portraits, studies of heads. Background detail is almost non-existent, the pictures usually being of a summary simplicity with figures in dark clothes and neutral backgrounds. Interpretation of character and expression is the dominant feature, and by means of effective poses and masterly brushwork, made up of black and white and grey strokes, the artist expressed the essence of his sitter's personality. In most cases we do not even know who the sitters were, and it is only recently that the dashing figure in this picture has been identified as the painter Jan Asselyn

07505-23conta0.jpg	"This painting is the pendant to the Martyrdom of St Matthew and hanging opposite in the Contarelli Chapel of the San Luigi dei Francesi, the French Church in Rome. It was particularly appropriate to both the place and the time, for Rome's French community had something to celebrate: Henri IV, heir to St Louis, had recently converted to the faith of his ancestors.The subject traditionally was represented either indoors or out; sometimes Saint Matthew is shown inside a building, with Christ outside (following the Biblical text) summoning him through a window. Both before and after Caravaggio the subject was often used as a pretext for anecdotal genre paintings. Caravaggio may well have been familiar with earlier Netherlandish paintings of money lenders or of gamblers seated around a table like Saint Matthew and his associates.Caravaggio represented the event as a nearly silent, dramatic narrative. The sequence of actions before and after this moment can be easily and convincingly re-created. The tax-gatherer Levi (Saint Matthew's name before he became the apostle) was seated at a table with his four assistants, counting the day's proceeds, the group lighted from a source at the upper right of the painting. Christ, His eyes veiled, with His halo the only hint of divinity, enters with Saint Peter. A gesture of His right hand, all the more powerful and compelling because of its languor, summons Levi. Surprised by the intrusion and perhaps dazzled by the sudden light from the just-opened door, Levi draws back and gestures toward himself with his left hand as if to say, ""Who, me?"", his right hand remaining on the coin he had been counting before Christ's entrance.The two figures on the left, derived from a 1545 Hans Holbein print representing gamblers unaware of the appearance of Death, are so concerned with counting the money that they do not even notice Christ's arrival; symbolically their inattention to Christ deprives them of the opportunity He offers for eternal life, and condemns them to death. The two boys in the center do respond, the younger one drawing back against Levi as if seeking his protection, the swaggering older one, who is armed, leaning forward a little menacingly. Saint Peter gestures firmly with his hand to calm his potential resistance. The dramatic point of the picture is that for this moment, no one does anything. Christ's appearance is so unexpected and His gesture so commanding as to suspend action for a shocked instant, before reaction can take place. In another second, Levi will rise up and follow Christ_in fact, Christ's feet are already turned as if to leave the room. The particular power of the picture is in this cessation of action. It utilizes the fundamentally static medium of painting to convey characteristic human indecision after a challenge or command and before reaction.The picture is divided into two parts. The standing figures on the right form a vertical rectangle; those gathered around the table on the left a horizontal block. The costumes reinforce the contrast. Levi and his subordinates, who are involved in affairs of this world, are dressed in a contemporary mode, while the barefoot Christ and Saint Peter, who summon Levi to another life and world, appear in timeless cloaks. The two groups are also separated by a void, bridged literally and symbolically by Christ's hand. This hand, like Adam's in Michelangelo's Creation, unifies the two parts formally and psychologically. Underlying the shallow stage-like space of the picture is a grid pattern of verticals and horizontals, which knit it together structurally.The light has been no less carefully manipulated: the visible window covered with oilskin, very likely to provide diffused light in the painter's studio; the upper light, to illuminate Saint Matthew's face and the seated group; and the light behind Christ and Saint Peter, introduced only with them. It may be that this third source of light is intended as miraculous. Otherwise, why does Saint Peter cast no shadow on the defensive youth facing him "

38510-1embarka.jpg	Agostino Tassi derived some of his images of the sea coast from Bril, but others of real or imagined buildings near the water were based on Jan Brueghel the Elder. Tassi's work was a fundamental source for many of Claude's most famous port scenes as well as for the whole tradition of capricci. His coastal views of palaces and loggias had subjects taken from varied sources, but his favourite theme was the embarkation of a queen. In certain cases, but not in this painting, she can be clearly identified as the Queen of Sheba. The Barberini later owned two much larger paintings (2,5 x 1,8 m) by Tassi representing palaces set near water, one depicting the contemporary event of the departure of the Queen of Hungary from Ancona and the other simply showing fishermen on the bank of a river.The similar dimensions of The Embarkation of a Queen and The Coral Fishers might suggest that the two were intended as pendants, but since they were executed almost a decade apart, this was clearly not the case. However, architectural paintings were often paired with landscapes. A number of seventeenth-century sources indicate that collectors liked to hang prospettive (paintings focused on architecture) between two paesi (landscapes). The Embarkation of a Queen has been dated to c. 1622, but its cold, sharp light suggests that it was executed no later than 1615-16. The large loggia in the middle ground is reminiscent of Tuscan architecture, while the precision employed to render the plates and vases on the steps is derived from Tassi's life-long interest in Flemish art. The small figures are typical of Tassi and recur throughout his career

41286-02trinit.jpg	This type of representation of the Holy Trinity - the Man of Sorrows held by God the Father with the Holy Ghost in the likeness of a dove - was widely adopted in European art around 1400 when it was customary to show particular reverence for the dead Saviour. Though of unknown provenance, it is thought that the panel comes from the western border region of Hungary, and is the only known Hungarian example of this iconographic type in painting.The earliest similar representation known to us is an example of French Burgundian art from around 1380. Pictures with half-length figures developed under the powerful influence of representations of the Piet&#224; in which the Man of Sorrows is held by one or more angels. In respect to half-length figures, this work is similar to the M�nster panel by the Master of St. Veronica (1395-1415). In the type of head adopted for the figure of God the Father there is a certain relationship with the Sankt-Lambrecht votive panel (around 1430), now in Vienna, and with the Holy Trinity in the Hungarian National Gallery. The finely tooled haloes and border adornments were very popular in Viennese painting at the beginning of the fifteenth century. They can also be seen on other panels more Austrian in style.It is believed that this painting was once on the obverse of the right wing of a small triptych or diptych

His visit to Italy (1750-1758) took him first to Venice, then to Rome. While in Italy he decided to abandon portrait painting for landscape, later becoming the first great British landscape painter. The principal sources of his inspiration were Poussin, Lorrain and Vernet, and he also owed something to Dutch landscape painting of the late 17th century Among his finest works are his English landscape and Welsh mountain scenes, which are executed with topographical accuracy and show great skill in composition and a finely graded palette in the way they convey the expanse and peace of the lakes and hills

14499-garden.jpg	By around 1910, Impressionism and its related styles were universal in North America. They had significance in catalyzing the formulation by individual artists' groups of their own visual idioms. In this respect, the painting of Frederick Frieseke was an extension of the North American tradition in Impressionist figure painting.Frieseke belonged to the third American generation to paint at Giverny. After the painters of 1887 and shortly thereafter had spent their summers there and returned to the US, there had been a second wave of Giverny tourism in the 1890s. Garden scenes and nudes provided the circle with new motifs that were adopted and adapted by the next, third generation.Frieseke had begun by painting earthy interiors, but visits to Giverny in and after 1900 led him to abandon them in favour of open-air scenes, of which Lady in a Garden is typical

While he is away, his friend, another artist, makes love to her and erases the image. Before doing so, however, he had carefully copied it onto a piece of paper seen lying on the floor.

26355-v_market.jpg	Horticulture was as potent a source of pride and livelihood in the Dutch Republic as livestock. The vegetable market painted by Gabriel Metsu displays an impressive variety of cabbages and root vegetables against a backdrop of the Prinsengracht, one of Amsterdam's finest canals. Metsu gave pride of place to the Horn carrot (the orange root in the cane basket) and the cauliflower, both of them expensive vegetables that Dutch growers had recently developed; they are contrasted with turnips and other staples of Dutch cooking. The canal calls attention to an enabling factor of Amsterdam's economy: its ready access to Holland's network of waterways.In setting and motifs, the painting is about Amsterdam's flourishing vegetal and economic cultures, both the subject of numerous laudatory descriptions. While such specific market pictures had some general precedents, their combination of actual sites with the best of locally grown produce constitutes their novelty, and even their seventeenth-century Dutchness

23739-andorfe1.jpg	The sitter of the portrait is Sebastian Andorfer (1469-1537), a top mining official of Schwaz in Tirol. His father held a prominent position in the mining administration at Schwaz, serving as 'Silberbrenner' (refiner of silver) from 1470 to 1499. Sebastian assumed the post in 1499 and occupied it until his death in 1537.A variant of the portrait exists, also dated 1517, in which Andorfer is depicted beardless. The two portraits may exemplify the practice, which can be observed in contemporary medals, of recording a change in appearance for eternity. However, no known biographical events correspond with the 1517 date of the portraits. Furthermore, technical investigations suggest that the execution of the beardless portrait preceded the bearded one.The two Andorfer portraits stand as the earliest securely dated works in Maler's oeuvre

22601-8barbad.jpg	The earliest of Lippi's altarpieces, the Barbadori Altarpiece, named for the family who commissioned it (for the Barbadori Chapel in Santo Spirito, Florence), demonstrates aspects of his art that can be regarded as characteristic. He disregards perspective, tending to clutter the space with inventive but nonstructural architecture, while at the same time showing little interest in rendering his figures and the objects that surround them to a consistent scale. For example, the Virgin and the Child are quite large in size, much larger than the two saints before them, while the angels are an intermediate size. Lippi reverses, as it were, the spatial order.The predella is now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. The altarpiece was commissioned in 1437 and finished in the following year

23359-15lucy4.jpg	"The predella of the St Lucy Altarpiece was constituted by three panels, from left to right: St Lucy at the Tomb of St Agatha; St Lucy before Paschasius and St Lucy Harnessed to Oxen; Teams of Oxen. The altarpiece was commissioned from Lotto by the Confraternity of St Lucy in Iesi in 1523.The predella scenes reveal Lotto's talent as a painter of lively narrative scenes.The second scene is restricted to a narrow field on the left of the central predella panel, bounded by the green curtain. Lucy's fianc�, enraged by losing her dowry, complained to the Roman consul Paschasius, who now questions Lucy about her religious beliefs and demands that she worship idols. After an angry altercation, Paschasius orders her to be removed to a brothel.The story continues on the main panel of the altarpiece which depicts St Lucy Seized by the Panders. In this scene Paschasius summons the panders to ""invite the crowd to have pleasure with this woman, and let them abuse her body until she dies; but the panders tried to carry her off, the Holy Ghost made her so heavy that they were unable to move her."" At the extreme right, partly cut by the frame, the disappointed fianc� assists the panders in their fruitless efforts.The story then moves back to the predella where the right-hand section of the central predella panel unites with the right panel, with its atmospheric townscape, to form a single extended scene. Paschasius furiously orders her to dragged away by teams of oxen. Again the Holy Ghost (the white dove) intervenes on Lucy's behalf. The extension of this fourth scene across more than half of the width of the entire predella, represents a highly original approach to predella design. No less than eight teams of powerful oxen are represented in the predella"

32766-04oddi2.jpg	Extant drawings demonstrate the tremendous amount of thought which Raphael put into the realization of the Oddi Altarpiece and some details, notably the highly individual faces of the Apostles and the serene landscape in the background, are quite masterful. But the most meaningful passages are found in the predella scenes: the vast space which opens out beneath the colonnades of the Annunciation; the highly animated Adoration of the Magi; and the free quality of the atmosphere in the Presentation in the Temple, which foreshadows the extraordinary spatial intuition of some of the artist's future Vatican compositions

08803-portrait.jpg	The painting is probably the left wing of a triptych.After a long period in oblivion, Christus is today regarded as Jan van Eyck's successor. He was probably van Eyck's pupil, and on his death took over the workshop and completed van Eyck's unfinished work. His significance today lies in his further development of the art of perspective. He was the first painter in the North who arrived empirically at the law of linear perspective and who applied it. His significant portraits are marked by their concentration on just a few characteristic details. He was also the first Dutch master to place the sitter not before a neutral background but in front of a recognisable interior. After he was made master and burgher of Bruges in 1444, van Eyck's influence waned and was replaced by his interest in van der Weyden and Campin. His representation of background, often in the form of landscapes in a mood of quiet harmony, influenced later Netherlandish painters, in particular Bouts, Ouwater and Geertgen. There was no further development in his later work, of which only six signed and dated pictures survive

12595-5_4holy2.jpg	"Four saints are standing, arranged in pairs, opposite each other in two panels. Three of the men are clearly identified by their attributes and the inscriptions at their feet; they are the apostle St John, reading his Gospel, St Peter with the key, and, in mirror symmetry on the other panel at the front, St Paul with his sword and book. St Mark, behind him, was one of the four Evangelists, not one of the twelve Apostles. The saints are also depicted at various points in life and represent the four humours.The inscriptions confirm the panels function as a profession of faith in the Reformation and a warning to the town council of Nuremberg not to diverge from Luther's teachings. The inscriptions are not arranged directly beneath the appropriate apostle, but appear in the order in which they were written by the apostles. The first we read is not St John's, but St Peter's New Testament text. The inscriptions emphasize both the arrangement of the figures on a rectangular ground plan and the equal value of the depicted people. The texts from the Holy Scriptures were written by the calligrapher and artists' biographer, Johann Neud�rffer (1497-1563). In 1627, when the original panels were taken to the Catholic city of Munich to form part of the art collection of the Bavarian Duke Maximilian I, the ""offending"" pro-Reformation inscriptions were sawn off and added to copies that were brought to Nuremberg. Not until 1921 were the original inscriptions finally reunited with the original paintings"

But the campaign had been fatally tarnished by the pillage it visited upon Constantinople, and Delacroix allows his victors no pleasure in their conquest.

44780-egypt.jpg	Whereas the names and works of Vel�zquez and Murillo were known and appreciated by European connoisseurs at a relatively early date, Zurbar�n was scarcely known outside Spain, and even now there are not very many of his works to be found in European galleries. Born in Fuente de Cantos, a small village in Estremadura, he studied in Seville and most of his work, almost exclusively commissions for monastic orders and churches, was done there. These circumstances determined his themes and the way he treated them: he painted hardly anything but religious subjects, mostly scenes from the lives of the saintly or monastic visionaries. His pictures are generally characterized by a severe structure, vigorous forms, rustic models and a close and detailed observation of nature.During the last years of his life Zurbar�n worked in Madrid where, mainly under the influence of Murillo, his interpretation became softer, his way of expression more lyrical and his colours lighter. The Holy Family (The Rest on the Flight to Egypt), signed and dated 1659, is a remarkable example of this late period: a simple composition of half-length figures with an intimate charm and emotionalism strongly reminiscent of Murillo

34921-03gartem.jpg	The fresco cycle in the vault of the monastery church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe narrates stories from the Old Testament in a rather confusing sequence. The artist had the task of representing the story of Moses, from the creation of the world until his death, and it had to be told by means of selected and exegetically representative scenes which were to be distributed all over the vaulted ceiling.

14653-03baronc.jpg	The Baroncelli Chapel is consecrated to the Annunciation to the Virgin, and thus the pictorial program is devoted to the life of the Virgin.The fresco cycle covers only the two walls of the front section of the space, beginning on the east wall with the Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple (top left) and Joachim's Dream (top right). It is followed on the same wall by Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate (middle left) and the Birth of the Virgin (middle right), Presentation of the Virgin (bottom left) and Marriage of the Virgin (bottom right).Taddeo Gaddi, one of Giotto's pupils painted the Baroncelli Chapel in the church of Santa Croce in Florence around 1330, brilliantly employing the technical achievements of his teacher. His scenes for the Life of the Virgin were painted with two goals in mind. First, to compose the painting so that it corresponded to the form of the chapel bay, which was arched. Second, by means of the architecture of the painting itself, to create a sufficiently deep stage for the sequence of events to be played out. Gaddi came up with an ingenious solution for the upper section directly under the arch. He placed the architecture of the temple directly beside a cliff which looms up on the right so that in the upper section a quatrefoil shape is created, an open space out of which he let an angel descend. This served to link the scenes Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple and the Joachim's Dream.The sections below, with their alternating interiors and exteriors, appear as sets in front of which, and in which, the events take place. From the Meeting at the Golden Gate (top left) we move on to the Birth of St John the Baptist, the Virgin on her Way to the Temple, and finally the Marriage of the Virgin. As in San Francesco in Assisi, the architecture of the painting is closely linked to the architecture of the church, the continuous narrative to the way a viewer reads.The cycle continues on the south wall (at right in the picture)

02497-3seaso3.jpg	Because of the similar dimensions and support (canvas), the Summer and the Autumn in Denver, and the Winter in Houston are considered to belong to the same series of Four Seasons.Since the version of Autumn from Arcimboldo's initial series of Seasons, dated 1563, is lost, this version of Autumn is important as representing the earliest surviving depiction of that season by Arcimboldo. Comparison of this painting of Autumn with an authentic version dated 1573 (in the Louvre, Paris) indicates a similar manner of construction, same materials, and similar touch.

09352-lahues.jpg	Gillis Congnet was - beside Anthonis Mor and Frans Pourbus the Elder - one of the important Flemish portrait painters of the second half of the 16th century. The portrait of Pierson La Hues, drummer and page of the Old Archers' Guild, was painted by him in 1581. This painting is a marvelous representative of a genre which, in the 16th century, was the least rated of the painter's specialisms. As the portrait is closest to life, contemporary opinion deemed it to be much less creative or intellectual than mythological, biblical or moralistic painting.

20132-man_look.jpg	Samuel van Hoogstraten was active as a painter in several different genres, and also an engraver and writer. In his treatise of 1678 he explained the importance of illusionism in painting and the need for perspective in the fine arts. He himself frequently practiced these skills and became one of the most important seventeenth-century creators of trompe-l'oeil paintings and perspective boxes. The eye-fooling artistry of trompe-l'oeil was extremely popular at the courts of Europe in the seventeenth century.

19973-1portman.jpg	Starting in the 1530s and continuing into the early 1540s, Holbein made a number of small, round bust-length portraits of various sitters, including potential wives for Henry VIII, members of the royal household, and servants to the king. Some were painted in oil on wood, others in bodycolour on vellum as miniatures.The sitter of the present portrait, showing a young, clean-shaven man against a monochrome blue background, is not identified, but he was certainly an official at the court of Henry VIII.

16042-franc17.jpg	"This is the seventeenth of the twenty-eight scenes (twenty-five of which were painted by Giotto) of the Legend of Saint Francis.Francis wanted to surprise Pope Honorius III with a well-prepared sermon; however, he lost the thread of what he was saying and had to improvise. His address captivated everyone and convinced them that the spirit of God spoke through him. Giotto expresses this through the different reactions of those listening, reflected especially in the lively facial expressions.As he experienced with depicting space, Giotto's knowledge increased. In this fresco painted a three-dimensional ""box"" representing the hall. He then emphasized the space by cleverly arranging the architectural elements and human figures within it.

35146-crossing.jpg	The fresco is from the cycle of the life of Moses in the Sistine Chapel. It is located on the third compartment on the south wall. The episodes from the life of Moses were conceived of as typological scenes prefiguring significant episodes in the life of Christ.In the painting we see the people of Israel passing through the Red Sea. The sequence begins in the background to the right, where Moses and Aaron are pleading with Pharaoh to release the people of Israel. After God sends plagues on Egypt, Pharaoh finally relents, but then pursues the departing foreigners with his army. Moses parts the waters of the sea with his staff so that the Israelites can pass through them. When he raises the staff a second time the waters close up behind them, and their pursuers, Pharaoh in the lead, are drowned. Rising above the flood is the pillar of fire with which God struck fear in the army of the Egyptians. On the left-hand shore Moses stands, staff in hand, with the people of Israel. The kneeling woman in the foreground is the prophetess Miriam, who has taken up a drum to thank the Lord for their rescue

03975-bello203.jpg	Bellotto was not the first painter at the Saxon court employed specially to depict topographical scenes. The tradition of this type of work in Saxony reaches back at least to the first quarter of the seventeenth century and Bellotto's work ought to be interpreted within this tradition. Bellotto's paintings of Dresden show the overall picture of the city, the Zwinger, the principal squares and the two most important churches, the Kreuzkirche and the Frauenkirche. The artist also produced engravings after most of these paintings.Perpendicular to the image surface and stretching towards the east runs the Innere Rampische Gasse. The left foreground is taken up entirely by the southern wall of the Frauenkirche. This creation of Georg Bahr, completed in 1743 and destroyed in 1945, was hemmed in on all sides by buildings, so that it was impossible to gain a picture of the church in its entirety.The painter probably used a camera obscurato reduce the church's height; because of the short distance the church is represented with a marked perspective distortion. Undoubtedly in order to prevent such distortions from dominating the image completely and to achieve a better spatial effect, the church is not shown frontally. Instead, Bellotto has shifted his attention to the right, so that the view is determined by the axis of the Rampische Gasse and only the roof and south wall of the church can be seen.The Frauenkirche was the most important modern church of Dresden, the Kreuzkirche the most important old one. In the pendant to this painting (also in Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Dresden) Bellotto represented the Kreuzkirche

37357-winter09.jpg	Many of Sisley's works appear to be typical examples of Impressionism, and this snow-covered landscape, which dates from his most successful period, is no exception. In his treatment of the mother-of-pearl tones of the snow, the artist truly mastered the evocation of the imponderable and the transitory. The painting is one of the most poetic renderings of the fragile and ephemeral world of snow.Sisley was a British-French landscape painter. Born in Paris to English parents, he began painting as an amateur. His early style was much influenced by Camille Corot. He became associated with Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir and with them became one of the founders of Impressionism. His works, mostly landscapes, are distinguished from those of his colleagues by their softly harmonious values. His family was ruined by the Franco-Prussian War, and his life was a constant struggle against poverty. Not until after his death did his talent begin to be widely recognized

03822-106madon.jpg	This highly balanced picture incorporates a system of double lighting that characterizes a small group of similar compositions. The curtain behind the Virgin captures the light coming from in front of her in such a way that the shadow of her figure is projected onto the fabric. In the landscape background beyond, on the other hand, the light expands totally independently in an even, diffused luminosity. The two small trees, or alberetti, on either side of the Virgin that give the painting its name may allude to the Song of Solomon or, in contrast with the dead bushes next to them, the Old and New Testaments.The panel, the first known work by Bellini to bear a date, is signed and dated under the feet of the Child: IOANNES.BELLINUS.P. / 1487

15571-4desert.jpg	"Ghirlandaio's workshop produced three panel paintings to form part of the overall decoration of the Tornabuoni Chapel: on the rear wall, and the front and back panels of the main altarpiece. That on the rear wall, described by Vasari as ""Our Lady who appears with the Child in celestial glory together with the archangel Michael and St John the Baptist, and at the sides St Catherine of Siena and St Laurence dressed as Deacon"" was lost in the careless restoration of 1804, but the frescoes which framed it with the Stories of St Peter Martyr have survived. The execution of Saint John is not depicted in the Tornabuoni Chapel. In its place, however, is the fresco on the window wall showing the martyrdom of the Dominican saint Peter Martyr. Perhaps the intention was to equate the Dominican saint with John the Baptist. This fresco was probably executed by David and Benedetto Ghirlandaio.Also survived the St John in the Desert, one of the most famous frescoes, which was by tradition attributed to the young Michelangelo. Many writers believe the young Michelangelo carried out some of the work in these poorer paintings by Ghirlandaio's workshop. They even believe that a narrow fresco on the window wall may contain a portrait of the barely fifteen year old artist, who is thought to have worked as an assistant in the Tornabuoni Chapel.When he was a boy, Saint John went into the desert in order to do penance.

28844-holyfami.jpg	Brescia, an ancient town at the southernmost edge of the foothills of the Alps, was once part of the Duchy of Milan but had been ruled by the more liberal Republic of Venice since 1426. It was occupied by the French in 1509, rebelled in 1512 and was retaken and sacked, returning to Venice only in 1516. Alessandro Bonvicino, called Moretto, a native of Brescia, must have lived through these bloody events. With Savoldo, Romanino and, for a time, his own pupil Moroni, Moretto was one of the leading painters of the town, known especially for his religious pictures. Executed for patrons mainly associated with the Catholic Reformation, they are notable for their clear and explicit doctrinal content and the hypnotic power of their realism, often expressed through everyday settings and low-life models as well as through the minute depiction of surface detail

40910-05tript1.jpg	This remarkable work which came to light recently seems to be by the same Memling follower who painted the Santa Barbara Lamentation (Museum of Art). In the larger Lamentation, however, the painter is more precise in the details than in the miniature scenes, which seem to be painted with an unruly brush. Typologically, however, everything corresponds: the rather stiff figures with wooden gestures and attitudes, the hard folds, the trees with thick burly foliage, the plump clouds with heavy lighted edges. Remarkable about this triptych is the fact that many of the little scenes have been taken from well-known Memling compositions: it is largely conceived as a pastiche of Memling fragments. From left to right and from top to bottom, the triptych contains the following scenes:Left wing1. Annunciation2. Visitation3. Nativity4. Jesus among the PhariseesCentral panel5. Presentation in the Temple6. Flight into Egypt7. Mourning Mary and Joseph8. Flagellation9. Carrying of the Cross10. Crucifixion11. Lamentation12. Entombment13. Circumcision14. Mount of Olives15. Christ at the column16. Christ released from the Flagellation column by Mary and John17. Crowning with Thorns18. Mocking of Christ19. Christ nailed to the Cross20. CrucifixionRight wing21. Resurrection22. Ascension23. Descent of the Holy Ghost24. Death of the Virgin.The work is popular in conception and there is hardly any logic in the arrangement of the scenes. Following the example of contemporaneous miniature painting (Simon Bening) they are enclosed in a painted window in early Renaissance style. Only the wings are arranged in chronological order with scenes from the Childhood and scenes after the Christ's death. In the central panel, which is mainly devoted to the Passion, everything is mixed up. Spatially the artist has shown a degree of circumspection, for the scenes at the top have a very low horizon, while the lower scenes exhibit the usual foreshortening in successive plans. The conscious reference to various works by Memling (with some scenes possibly deriving from lost compositions) clearly points to a painter who had access to these works while they were still in the workshop or to whom working drawings were available. It is also remarkable that the borrowings come from late works. It can be assumed therefore that we are here dealing with a student or assistant of Memling

But she soon alleviated his lot by making him her lover. While in her service he grew effeminate, wearing women's clothes and adornments, and spinning yarn.The subject, portraying one of the hero's errors, inspired Boucher to paint one of the most audaciously erotic and best-executed canvases of the century - an agitated, brilliant composition full of wit and joyous verve, which Boucher would only rarely equal afterward.

16585-life_chr.jpg	"This work was once assigned to the hand of Giotto, then to a follower of Giotto. In 1935, however, it was identified with Giovanni da Rimini, one of the most significant exponents of the Riminese branch of the giottesque movement. This panel belongs to the early maturity of the artist, who is clearly displaying his ties to the painting of Giotto. Giovanni had plenty of opportunity to be exposed to Giotto, who worked at the ""Tempio Malatestiano"", during a Riminese sojourn estimated to have taken place between 1300 and 1303.The panel is one half of a diptych: the other wing, showing stories of the Virgin and saints, was in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland at Alnwick Castle (England). It was sold through Sotheby's in 2014. Aside from the influence of Giotto's style, the two wings show the adoption of a distinctly Giottesque iconography, closely related to the famous cycle at Assisi"

31001-ensign.jpg	A youth leans against a battered pedestal, casually supporting himself on his left arm; his right hand grasps the pole of a white nag, which falls in gentle folds onto his shoulder. The motifs in this picture can be quickly enumerated, but the quality of the painting itself is incomparably rich. The deep blue of the young man's jacket is broken by the turquoise lining of his collar, which mediates the gold tones of the brocade below. The white flag visits every nuance of cold and warm in shades of grey and ochre; the fabric reflects the light, is permeated by the light, tempers it and consigns it back into the shadows. The white creates a tense backdrop to the face shown in profile; an enormous range of contrasts from the brightest shades to the darkness of the background is manifested in a rich web of juxtapositions.The imagery of the painting is reminiscent in its central motif &#151; a figure leaning on a pedestal - of portraiture, while the pathos of the flag and the young man's attentive gaze are more reminiscent of historical painting.The painting's point of departure lies in the painterly effects offered by chiaroscuro. Piazzetta painted and drew a number of similarly indeterminate figures, partly in a genre or pastoral scene, partly militaristic with the figure dressed as a standard-bearer, archer or lancer

35557-07planti.jpg	Christoffel (Christophe) Plantin (1520-1589), French printer, founder of an important printing house and publisher of the Antwerp Polyglot Bible. Plantin learned bookbinding and bookselling at Caen, Normandy, and settled in 1549 as a bookbinder in Antwerp. A bad arm wound seems to have led him (about 1555) to turn to typography. His many publications were distinguished by their excellent typography, and he was original in using copper, instead of wood, engravings for book illustrations. His greatest venture, the Biblia regia, which would fix the original text of Old and New Testaments, was supported by Philip II of Spain in spite of clerical opposition and appeared in eight volumes during 1569-72.When Antwerp was plundered by the Spaniards in 1576 and Plantin had to pay a ransom, he established a branch office in Paris and then, in 1583, settled in Leiden as the typographer of the new university of the states of Holland, leaving his much-reduced business in Antwerp in the hands of his sons-in-law, John Moerentorf (Moretus) and Francis van Ravelinghen (Raphelengius). But in 1585 Plantin returned to Antwerp and Raphelengius took over the business in Leiden. After Plantin's death, the Antwerp business was carried on by Moretus, but it declined during the second half of the 17th century. All was religiously preserved, however, and in 1876 the city of Antwerp acquired the buildings and their contents and created the Plantin-Moretus Museum

15906-07portra.jpg	This beautiful painting is one of the most problematical pictures in the history of art and a constant subject of debate. The identity of the painter is still in question and, while the majority of experts ascribe it to Giorgione, there are a number of scholars who believe it was painted by Giovanni Cariani (an artist much influenced by Giorgione) or by some other Venetian painter active around 1510. Any decision is rendered more difficult by the fact that the painting has come down to us in a very bad condition: the window-opening on the left and the landscape in the background, for example, are so faded that they are scarcely visible to the naked eye. X-ray photographs reveal alterations to both the eyes and the hands, made while the picture was being painted, similar to modifications in other paintings by Giorgione. Certainly there are several features - the extraordinarily fine painterly approach, the intimacy of the expression, the inclusion of the parapet and the window-opening - which support the belief that Portrait of a Man was painted by Giorgione himself, possibly not long before his death in 1510.The emblems on the parapet - the small hat with a V on it, the female triple head, the tiny tablet and the inscription - have been variously interpreted. One explanation, the most frequent and perhaps the most acceptable, is that this picture is a portrait of the poet Antonio Broccardo

18243-0604grec.jpg	Portrayed as a hermit saint, Mary Magdalen sits alone outside her cave, which according to legend was at St-Baume in southern France. During the course of his career El Greco developed five different compositions representing the Magdalen in penitence. This is an excellent example of the first of these developed soon after his arrival in Spain. Demand for such images was so strong that El Greco had copies made in his workshop from his originals. In this painting, the refined execution of the drapery and of the still-life indicate the hand of El Greco himself.In this composition El Greco drew on Titian's interpretation of the subject in a painting now in the Hermitage. However, El Greco's rendition is more emotionally charged. A later version of the same composition in the Nelson Atkins Museum, Kansas City shows the Magdalen in exactly the same position but with the landscape to the left and the still-life to the right

The simplicity of composition, the use of near monochrome, for the most part shades of brown and grey and the greyish skies heavy with rain-clouds which play an important part in his seascapes all differentiate van Goyen's paintings from those of his contemporaries who generally preferred to paint stormy seas complete with ships of war, and the buildings of a port in the background. Van Goyen concentrated on the sea itself and only made use of such subsidiary details - boats, fishermen or seamen - as were absolutely necessary to indicate the environment.The painting is signed as VG on the boat at the left side

44677-prince_e.jpg	Zoffany was born near Frankfurt-am-Main and in 1760 travelled to England, where he won success as a painter of conversation pieces and theatrical scenes. He was extensively patronised by George III and Queen Charlotte, although he had no official connection with the court. Zoffany was nominated personally by George III in 1769 for membership of the newly founded Royal Academy, where he exhibited between 1770 and 1800. The artist was absent from England for two long periods: firstly in Italy from 1772 to 1778 and secondly in India from 1783 to 1789.Some of Zoffany's most captivating work was done for the Royal Family, for example, Queen Charlotte and her Two Eldest Sons of 1771. Like the conversation pieces, many of the single portraits are imbued with a surprising degree of informality implied more by the pose than the finish, which is always meticulous. Both qualities are apparent in the portrait of Prince Ernest Gottlob Albert of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, where the sitter leans nonchalantly against a chair and looks away from the viewer. The figure is sharply lit from the right, but set against a dark background. The coiffure, the facial features and the uniform are all carefully and precisely modelled, but in such a way that the technical skill heightens the effect of the characterisation.Prince Ernest of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1742-1814) was the youngest brother of Queen Charlotte. He is depicted in Hanoverian military uniform, wearing the ribbon and star of the Polish Order of the White Eagle. He was a keen soldier and in 1788 George III appointed him General of Infantry in the British Army. The portrait was probably painted for Queen Charlotte in the spring of 1772 as the sitter had returned to Hanover by May

05694-syrinx.jpg	Pan in Greek mythology is the god of woods and fields, flocks and herds. In Renaissance allegory he personifies Lust; he charmed the nymphs with the music of his pipes. The story of Pan and Syrinx is described by Ovid (Metamorphoses 1:689-713). Pan was pursuing a nymph of Arcadia named Syrinx when they reached the River Ladon which blocked her escape. To avoid the god's clutches she prayed to be transformed, and Pan unexpectedly found himself holding an armful of tall reeds. The sound of the wind blowing through them so pleased him that he cut some and made a set of pipes which are named after the nymph

14268-2nativi.jpg	This beautiful altarpiece is completed by a lunette attributed to Matteo di Giovanni and has altar steps painted by Bernardino Fungai. As such it sums up the Sienese school in the late fifteenth century. After his years in Urbino working as an architect, Francesco di Giorgio took up painting once more. The evolution in his style compared to his earlier work is obvious. The artist had by now fully mastered the depiction of space. The figures are scattered, paired into couples whose movements counterbalance each other.Colours are carefully juxtaposed. The grandiose ruined arch that dominates the scene showed Francesco di Giorgio's love of the classical world which he depicted with the deft strokes of an architectural drawing.

07255-canal705.jpg	The majestic sweep of the river, leading to a skyline dominated by St Paul's Cathedral, forms the focus of this canvas, which was made as a companion picture for The Whitehall and the Privy Garden from Richmond House. Canaletto has succeeded in creating an extraordinary sense of spaciousness: with the combination of calm water, bright clear morning light and an untroubled sky, he has brought to the London scene some of that clarity of vision, and pleasure in celebrating the attractions of a great city that he had earlier applied to Venice.The terraces in the foreground belong to Richmond House and, at the left, Montagu House. The figures on them parade, converse, and in a leisurely manner watch the spectacle of the river in the sunshine. While a number of smaller boats skull about on it, two larger decorated barges belonging to the City of London, make their way upstream.

20449-ruyter.jpg	Michiel de Ruyter (1607-1676) was one of the most famous admirals in Dutch history. He is most famous for his role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century. His victories in the naval battles of the Dutch War of Independence and later during the Anglo-Dutch wars assured his place not only as a national hero, but also as one of the most respected admirals in history. His greatest military achievement was the Four Days' Battle of June 1666, which resulted in defeat for the English navy.De Ruyter was vice-admiral of Holland when he had himself portrayed together with his family in 1662 by Juriaen Jacobsz. The imposing painting was awarded a prominent place in the interior room of the admiral's new house in Amsterdam. The painter set the group in a seemingly Mediterranean, park-like landscape with cypresses, a fountain and an obelisk. In addition to the baton, around his neck De Ruyter, seated next to his third wife, boasts the prestigious French order of Saint Michael. This detail was added later, since he received the chain from the French king Louis XIV in 1666, four years after the canvas was completed

03567-01reale.jpg	"Throughout the whole of the eighteenth century the Turinese court avidly acquired paintings by Italy's best and most famous artists. It also encouraged budding local painters thereby supplying itself  with potential artists to meet its demand for painted decoration. Claudio Francesco Beaumont's apprenticeship in Rome in the 1710s and then in the 1720s was financed by royal stipends. Returning from Rome, in 1731 Carlo Emanuele III named him ""primo pittore di gabinetto"", and for the next two decades he was responsible for all the painting in the Palazzo Reale.Beaumont's contribution to the painting of the Palazzo Reale includes, in addition to four living rooms, two galleries, of which the Galleria della Regina, later named after him, is one of the largest (60 m long) and the most magnificent of its kind. In 1833, it was separated from the palace complex, and has since served as the Armeria Reale, housing the Savoyard weapon collection.The subject of the ceiling painting in the Galleria is the legend of Aeneas, the mortal son of Venus who escaped from the burning Troy with his father and his son, and after many trials and misadventures landed at last at the mouth of the Tiber. There he became through his son Ascanius the progenitor of the gens Julia.The picture shows a rarely depicted episode of the Legend of Aeneas: Aeneas placing an offering on his father's grave in Sicily, where the appearance of a snake proves a good omen"

18313-1201grec.jpg	"The ""expressionist"" stylistic traits, characteristic of El Greco's paintings at the end of the 1590s, are also found in the paintings of a retable El Greco created for the Augustinian college of Nuestra Se&#241;ora de la Encarnacion in Madrid between 1596 and 1600. The patroness of the college, the lady-in-waiting Do&#241;a Mar�a de C�rdoba y Arag�n, had died back in 1593, implying that the commission likely came from her executor. The retable, like many other works in possession of the Church, was disassembled into its component parts during the French occupation of Spain. All we know from the surviving written sources is that El Greco supplied a total of seven paintings. This Annunciation in the Prado is one of these paintings, and it is an especially good example of the daring palette that characterizes the entire series.At the bottom of the canvas, the terrestrial world is barely indicated by the steps, sewing basket and rose-bush in flame. The flames are rendered so naturalistically that they probably have appeared to mirror the real candle flames burning on the altar during the celebration of the Mass. But above and beyond El Greco has distorted light, colour and form. Indeed,all the form are in a state of flux. the grand rhythm of the wings of Gabriel and the Holy Spirit quicken the drama. Garments of crystalline blue, crimson and yellow-green vibrate against the blue-grey void. Incandescent light is reflected off the figures with such intensity that each seems to be its own source of light"

15901-02laura.jpg	This painting has been altered over the centuries, first transposed into an oval picture and then restored back to a rectangular one. Originally the figure extended below the waist, and there was more space above. The effect was one of much less immediacy for the viewer than is the case today in its cut-down version and was more in keeping with the remoteness of Giorgione's images as we know them. Like all of Giorgione's pictures, enigmatic aspects persist; the subject is unspecific, although the artistic intention is the presentation of the surface beauty, the soft flesh juxtaposed against the fur of the luxurious garment, the dark eyes, shining and alert, the thin veil enticingly but gently winding around the exposed breast. The laurel branches, which give their name to the figure, are painted with considerable realism and permit the head to be silhouetted before a neutral gray-green halo of leaves, isolated from the deep-toned background, not unlike Leonardo's Ginevra de' Benci. Leonardo's influence has often been noted in Giorgione's art, most particularly in the softening of the contours.This young woman is perhaps a courtesan and a poet, the combination of which is not unknown in Renaissance Venice. Her name is assumed to be Laura because of the depiction of laurel springs behind her. The sensuousness of the representation, the soft flesh of the breast against the fur of her garment, is consistent with the delicacy of treatment in the medium of oil paint, of which Giorgione was an unequaled master.It is assumed that the sitter probably was also the model of the Tempest.The painting is dated and signed on the back side. It belonged to the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels, as shown by the painting of David Teniers (now in the Prado, Madrid).

38535-1allegor.jpg	Abraham van den Tempel painted a series of three allegorical history pieces for the governors of the Lakenhal, or Clothmakers' Hall in Leiden between 1648 and 1651. The commission was a prestigious one, not only because of the size of the pictures, but also because they were history pieces to be displayed in a high ranking public building. The governors who commissioned the work were men of considerable stature, too. They were entrusted by the city fathers with the day-to-day management of one of Leiden's nine textile sectors, known in Dutch as 'neringen'. In this capacity they were responsible for the manufacture of and trade in worsted, a sector that was booming at the time. Their seat of office was the brand-new building which has been known to this day as the Lakenhal. They wanted classicist decorations worthy of their modern building.Regarding the series, Minerva Crowns the Maid of Leiden originally served as the overmantel, while the other two, Mars Banishes 'Nering' and The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' hung on the long wall beside one another. The latter two paintings form pendants, being the same size and related in subject-matter. The theme that connects them is 'nering', the term formerly used in Leiden for the production of and trade in textile.In Mars Banishes 'Nering', Minerva and Mercury escort the personification of nering, who looks back in disgust, from Mars in his suite of armor. The war god in his bellicose guise is attended by his henchmen Deimos and Phobos, the sowers of fear and dread. The woman he tramples underfoot, whose hat identifies her as Liberty, shows how Mars puts an end to freedom. A second prostate figure, recognisable by her scales and sword as Justice, is another of his victims. The buildings ablaze in the background warn of the adversity that comes in his wake

12483-10seven.jpg	D�rer's earliest known altarpiece may well have been commissioned by Frederick the Wise for his palace church at Wittenberg. It was probably ordered in April 1496, when D�rer painted his portrait. A payment of 100 florins was made to the artist at the end of the year for the altarpiece.The altarpiece was originally very large, nearly two metres high and nearly three metres wide. The right half, representing the Seven Joys of the Virgin, is now missing and only the left half of the Seven Sorrows survives. The central part of the surviving wing depicts the grieving Virgin after the Crucifixion, with a golden sword about to pierce her heart. Around the Virgin are seven smaller panels with detailed scenes from the life of Christ (anticlockwise from top left): the Circumcision, the Flight into Egypt, the 12 year-old Christ among the Doctors, the Bearing of the Cross, the Nailing to the Cross, the Crucifixion and the Lamentation.The altarpiece was made in D�rer's newly established workshop and although it was made to his design, some of it may have been painted by assistants. D�rer's pen and ink study survives of the man drilling a hole in the Cross in the lower right panel of the Nailing to the Cross.The whole altarpiece was acquired in the mid-sixteenth century by the artist Lucas Cranach the Younger (1515-86), whose distinguished father had served as court painter in Wittenberg. It was probably Cranach the Younger who sawed the work into separate panels. The panel of the grieving Virgin (which at some point was reduced in size by 18 centimetres at the top) is now in Munich and those of the Seven Sorrows are in Dresden. The right half of the altarpiece representing the Seven Joys is known only through copies

04108-italian.jpg	Along with Jan Both, Adam Pynacker, Jan Asselyn and Karel Dujardin, Nicolaes Berchem introduced landscapes that instead of depicting the Dutch countryside, featured mountainous landscapes of Italian inspiration, with a staffage of rustic farmers and shepherds, and classical ruins from the Italian Campagna. The subdued palette that was favoured by the older Dutch landscape painters such as Jan van Goyen and Salomon van Ruysdael now gave way to strong colour contrasts and bright warm lighting. The landscapes of Berchem and other painters of the Italianate landscape are marked by a new monumentality and a sense of pastoral poetry that was to inspire generations of painters well into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.The present landscape was painted a few years after Berchem returned from a trip to Italy. In the foreground a group of Savoyards on their mules are represented between slender birch trees. In the background hills one can see the ruins of a cylindrical structure from Roman times, known as the Tomb of the Plautii. In reality this tomb is situated not in the hills, but along the banks of the river Anio, near Tivoli. It was in this mausoleum that Aulus Plautius, the commander of the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 was entombed. The tomb lies next to the equally well-known Roman bridge, the Ponte Lucano, of which here only the square entrance gate can be discerned, just behind the trees. Berchem may have visited Tivoli with its famous tomb when travelling through the Roman Campagna, and indeed he may have sketched it in order to reproduce it in one  of his landscapes when back in Holland

29894-nativity.jpg	The saints represented on the scene are Sts Francis, Mary Magdalene, and the young John the Baptist.The painting was originally in the church of Santa Maria dei Servi in Ferrara, where it was later replaced by a copy, which the local guide of 1770 records as being located in the sacristy. The picture was transferred from Ferrara to Rome in 1527. During the restoration of the altarpiece in 1948, the date MDXXVII was discovered on the lower edge under the frame. This may refer to the time when the painting was moved rather than to the year of its execution.The work is from the mature period of the artist, who was taught by Lorenzo Costa but came under the influence of both the Venetian style of the Bellini and the classicism of Raphael. The brush-work is similar to that of the Deposition in the Galleria di Capodimonte in Naples, dating from 1521, and the St Margaret in Copenhagen, painted in 1524. In both these works we find the same sharp and limpid treatment of volumes, as well as the pure and simple forms of the monumental figures in the foreground, together with a delicate colouring that tends toward transparent shades of blue, green, and yellow in the backgrounds.

33949-innocent.jpg	Though the historical significance of Caravaggio and his enormous influence on Baroque painting cannot be overlooked, we should not ignore the fact that there was considerable resistance against the more extreme tendencies in his art, such as the loss of the heroic sphere, or the presentation of the everyday and the ordinary. His greatest rival, whose influence was to extend far beyond that of Caravaggio well into the 18th and 19th centuries, was undoubtedly the Bolognese artist Guido Reni. An early work such as The Massacre of the Innocents bears clear traces of his initial links with Caravaggio and, at the same time, already reveals the most important arguments against him.Before a landscape bathed in light, but set with dark and heavy architecture, a group of eight adults and eight children (including the putti distributing the palm fronds of victory) has been skilfully arranged. The unusual vertical format, rarely used for this theme, and above all the symmetrical structure of figural counterparts indicate that Reni was particularly interested in a specific problem of composition: that of achieving a balance between centripetal and centrifugal movement while combining them in a static pictorial structure. Reni also seeks to achieve this equilibrium in his expression of effects and in the distribution of colour accents

At Santa Maria Maggiore mosaics were not only added to the interior but also to the outside of the apse and the fa�ade. Another exterior mosaic was the most famous of all the mosaics produced in Rome around 1300, the so-called Navicella (""Little Ship"") that Giotto created on commission from Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi. Roughly 9,5 x 13,5 m, the mosaic was placed on the west wall of the oratory of Santa Maria in Turri, in the atrium of the old St. Peter's. Like a huge tableau, it confronted worshippers as they left the basilica. It survives today in the form of a mutilated Baroque reproduction in the basilica's vestibule. Only two fragments from the original, heavily reworked heads of angels that were part of the framing decor, are preserved.The Navicella, for which Stefaneschi composed a verse caption, must have aroused enormous fascination among contemporaries immediately after it was completed as several replicas are known.Prior to the mosaic was finally installed inside the church in 1628, Francesco Berretta was commissioned to make an exact copy in paint, shown in this reproduction. The mosaic depicted on its uninterrupted surface St Peter walking on the waters. When Francesco Berretta made the copy on canvas of Giotto's mosaic in 1628 the framework, the figure of Peter and large parts from around the edges had already been lost. However, we can still make out the monumental composition of the mosaic - the great ship, in which Peter's companions, full of fear, watch the events on the water"

36892-s_louis2.jpg	In Mantua, the Gonzaga family marked their rapid ascent to prominence by commissioning in the church of San Francesco a large funerary chapel. The church was largely destroyed during World War II but fortunately the Gonzaga chapel survived.The Gonzaga chapel is the largest of the church's noble chapels, occupying the most prestigious location close to the apse. Here the bodies of princes and their consorts reposed in marble tombs - now largely removed - among brilliantly coloured frescoes that covered the chapel's vault and walls. Although only partially preserved, these paintings still give an idea of the extravagant visions of both patron and painter in realizing this commission.

38909-01martyr.jpg	To the testament of Andrea Stazio, a Venetian nobleman who died in 1722, we owe a cycle of paintings of great importance in the history of Venetian art. The will provided that twelve canvases should be painted for the church of San Stae (Venetian for St Eustace). All similar in size, they depict episodes in the lives of the Apostles and their martyrdom. The commission was given to twelve different Venetian painter, ranging from the aged Nicol&#242; Bambini, then seventy-one, through to Giambattista Tiepolo, almost at the start of his career.All the paintings were completed within a few months, in 1722 and early 1723. The artists were the following in alphabetic order: Antonio Balestra, Nicol&#242; Bambini, Gregorio Lazzarini, Silvestro Manaigo, Giambattista Mariotti, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Giambattista Piazzetta, Giambattista Pittoni, Sebastiano Ricci, Giambattista Tiepolo, Angelo Trevisano and Pietro Uberti. They vied with each other to transform the church into a remarkable showcase of currents and developments in eighteenth-century Venetian art.Tiepolo's painting is part of the cycle of the Apostles which as a 'collective exhibition' fortunately remained intact in the choir of the Baroque church San Stae, giving an outline of Venetian painting of the period. The subject of the painting is the martyrdom of St Bartholomew, whose tormentors are on the point of flaying him alive. The awfulness of the scene is matched by the extremely powerful composition which places the writhing body of the saint along the diagonal between the two henchmen. The eerie contrast between light and shade makes the scene all the more vivid. The expressive gesture with which the despairing saint stretches his arm heavenward transforms the picture into a wonderful depiction of divine grace, the existence of which is already signaled by the bright light emanating from above.This painting was inspired by Piazzetta and is placed opposite his St James in San Stae, and it is almost its mirror image. As in the other work, the structure dynamically offsets conflicting forces, rendered by means of a chiastic arrangement of diagonals and clear contrasts of light and shade

32102-brazlanx.jpg	Post was a visual reporter in the retinue of Prince Johan Maurits of Nassau-Siegen during an expedition of 1637-1644, which also included natural scientists. One of his tasks was to convey a graphic impression of the exotic fauna and flora to his countrymen back home. Post actually painted only six landscapes in Brazil and the rest in the Netherlands, probably based on studies and preliminary drawings made in the colony.Rather than depicting the alien vegetation in all its wild proliferation, Post showed it in a state of beginning cultivation, with broad plains dotted with haciendas and churches. In terms of composition, his landscape views resemble the type of overview landscape practiced in Holland by Philips Koninck. Evidently not concerned with sensational effects in view of the exotic environment, Post aimed at a reliable depiction of the topography to the extent that it had been settled, and of nature in the early stages of domestication. This went hand in hand with a desire to represent the abundance of plant species in an encyclopedic way, especially palms, rubber trees and cacti, but also bushes, ferns and climbing plants or lianas, which the artist tended to arrange into a slightly mysterious, dark foil in the foreground, like the wings on a stage. Behind this extended - again an infinite panorama with an airy sky over the horizon

35009-cremona1.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. He painted the scenes above the next arch, and continued the cycle on the right wall, where he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.Romanino was commissioned for the next four scenes of the Passion on the right wall; he painted in 1519 the scenes Christ before Pilate, Flagellation of Christ, Christ Crowned with Thorns, and Ecce Homo. For these scenes Romanino borrowed motifs from D�rer' engravings. The open brushwork, the atmospheric space, the architecture lined with sculpture, and the profound psychological characterization of the faces are owed to Romanino's study of Titian's frescoes in Padua.View all images of the fresco decoration in Cremona Cathedral by various artists

36715-colonna.jpg	The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).The most important room in the palace is the gallery (Grande Galleria) on the second floor of the south wing. It is more than a story and a half in height, and it receives light from both sides. It has two separate anterooms, marked off from the main space by pairs of columns. These extensions and the wall arrangements of the room with large pilasters produced the most magnificent secular space from the Roman Baroque.The painting of the gallery was begun in 1665 and lasted until 1685. The pictorial program unfolds in the vaults of the trio of rooms and it is supplemented to this day with the original statues, paintings, and elaborate furnishings. The architecture painting and framing is by Johann Paul Schor and his workshop, the narrative cycle on Marcantonio II Colonna is by Giovanni Coli and Filippo Gherardi, two painters from Lucca working as an inseparable team. The scenes on the ceiling illustrate decisive events from the military career of Marcantonio II Colonna (1535-1584). In its form and composition the narrative cycle borrows from sixteenth-century Venetian painting, which beginning with Veronese had specialised in depictions on ceilings of historical events viewed from extremely low vantage points

43747-shalott.jpg	Waterhouse's The Lady of Shalott depicts a scene from Alfred Lord Tennyson's 1832 poem of the same title, in which the poet describes the plight of a young woman isolated under an undisclosed curse in a tower near King Arthur's Camelot. It is typically Pre-Raphaelite in that it illustrates a vulnerable and doomed woman and is bathed in natural early-evening light. The lady is portrayed staring away from the crucifix, which sits beside three candles. During the late nineteenth century, candles were often used to symbolise life: in this image, two have blown out.According to legend, the Lady of Shalott was forbidden to look directly at reality or the outside world; instead she was doomed to view the world through a mirror, and weave what she saw into tapestry. One day the Lady saw Sir Lancelot passing on his way in the reflection of the mirror, and dared to look out at Camelot, bringing about a curse. The lady escaped by boat during an autumn storm. As she sailed towards Camelot and certain death, she sang a lament. Her frozen body was found shortly afterwards by the knights and ladies of Camelot, one of whom is Lancelot, who prayed to God to have mercy on her soul. The tapestry she wove during her imprisonment was found draped over the side of the boat.Waterhouse painted three different versions of this character, in 1888, 1894 and 1916.Tennyson's verse was popular with many of the Pre-Raphaelite poets and painters, and was illustrated by such artists as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Maw Egley, and William Holman Hunt.

07712-4birth1.jpg	Two panels of virtually the same size, depicting scenes constructed on a precisely mirror-image perspective grid, are in the centre of sustained scholarly debate which extends to both the subjects, the function, and the authorship. They depict ostensibly religious subjects with a plethora of detail taken, on the one hand, from contemporary life and inspired, on the other, by humanist-antiquarian interests. One of the panels (in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) represents the Birth of the Virgin, the other (in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) probably shows the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple.These two highly original pictures can be identified with an altarpiece painted by Fra Carnevale for a lay fraternity of flagellants in the hospital church of Santa Maria della Bella in Urbino. In the seventeenth century the altarpiece was confiscated by Cardinal Antonio Barberini, and in the 1930s they were sold from the Barberini collection to the museums in New York and Boston

17822-806goya.jpg	In this highly original composition Goya has portrayed himself sitting up supported by his friend Dr Arrieta who is holding a glass to his mouth. The shadowy figures in the background are perhaps allusions to nightmare visions conjured up during his illness. They recall the dark figures in some of the paintings with which Goya covered the walls of the Quinta del Sordo, where he was living during his illness, in retirement from the court. Above all, they resemble the attendants of the priest giving communion to St Joseph of Calasanz. Painted no doubt during his convalescence like the cabinet pictures he painted when he was recovering from his earlier illness of 1793, he has successfully re-created or remembered his appearance when he was near to death: a transformation of his appearance five years earlier.Goya presented his portrait to his doctor, Eugenio Garcia Arrieta, whom he esteemed highly a far cry from his earlier attitude to the ignorant ass of a doctor, the subject of his Capricho no. 40 entitled De que mal morir�?. (Of What Ill Will he Die?). This portrait was evidently admired as a painting or for its subject as two copies were made by Goya's pupil Asencio Julia. It also was singled out for special praise by his friend and biographer Valentin Carderera (1835): 'The canvas in which he portrayed himself on his deathbed, at the moment when the distinguished Dr Arrieta was giving him the draught which restored him to his country and to his numerous admirers, is a work that recalls all the vigour and mastery of his best years. His likeness of himself in agony and the physiognomy of the doctor, animated by the most benevolent expression, are drawn and coloured with the greatest mastery. Throughout the work it seems that Goya was trying to rejuvenate his talent in order to show the extent of his gratitude.

00664-trinity.jpg	"In the same period as the Madonna of the Harpies, according to the evidence of Vasari confirmed by stylistic links, Andrea painted another great panel, for the altar of a chapel in the Augustinian church of San Gallo. At the time of the siege of Florence in 1529 it was taken to safety inside the walls, to San Jacopo tra' Fossi, as were the two earlier paintings (Noli me tangere and the Annunciation).The altarpiece features Sts Augustine, Sebastian, Lawrence, Peter Martyr, Francis and Mary Magdalen placed before an indistinct backdrop of sky and clouds resplendent with a compact image of the Trinity.The subject of the picture is not rare in central Italian painting during this period of spiritual and religious debate. We need only mention the emblematic solutions provided by Raphael for analogous themes with the Disputation on the Sacrament in the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican, or the Ecstasy of St Cecilia, painted in 1514 for the church of San Giovanni in Monte at Bologna. Moreover, it was particularly congenial to the Augustinian clients of the monastery of San Gallo, who wished to present a theme dear to St Augustine, who is in fact depicted while leading a lively debate among other saints, in the presence of a stupendous Magdalene with the features of Lucrezia kneeling beside St Sebastian.We get the best possible idea of the admiration aroused by the picture from the enthusiastic words of Bocchi: ""In this church there are three wonderful pictures by Andrea del Sarto: but the one on the right, with saints disputing about the Trinity, is of all pictures in all places the most wonderful. In this picture we see what a lively colouring, a drawing of rare quality, a unique mastery, can do. Who ever saw clothing so lifelike, or the reliefs of surfaces so marked, the features of persons so vivid, and liveliness so conforming with the truth?. . . It does not seem as if these figures were made of paint, but of flesh; not clothed by artifice, but by nature. But if for a moment we put aside the colours, and the artifice, we enter into the spirit of that which is true beyond any doubt; and it seems that the persons are thinking, and adopting bodily attitudes, and talking, and are anything other than painted.""The only additions one can make to this admiring judgment from the past arise from the recuperation of the exceptional colours of the Disputation, obtained by a restoration that has only just been completed. Apart from certain irreversible alterations, such as the oxidization of the verdigris spread by the painter on the mantle of St Sebastian in order to emphasize the effect of shadow in the folds, and apart from missing parts and abrasions caused by previous cleanings, the removal - or the careful and extremely prudent reduction - of the layers of dirt and coloured varnishes deposited over the surface in the course of centuries has enabled us to rediscover warm, intense and most refined harmonies of colour set against the deep blue-green space of a stormy sky. The ""palette"" now revealed to us appears very similar indeed to that of the Madonna of the Harpies, and confirms the theory that these two masterpieces date from the same time"

12362-tivoli1.jpg	All Dughet's documented pictures are decorative cycles fore Roman patrons. Neither Claude nor Poussin was able to supply this demand, probably because they were temperamentally unsuited to working on a large scale, although both had tried it. One unifying thread runs through the hundreds of easel paintings at present associated with Dughet: they are all more or less related to Poussin's own approach to landscape, although none of them is signed, dated or documented. If anything, Dughet is even more dramatic and gloomy than Poussin, a fact that led Ruskin in the nineteenth century to complain of Dughet's lack of respect for nature.Not all of Dughet's work falls into the category of Poussin imitation, however. There is a category of much more naturalistic pictures, which often include views of Tivoli, as in the excellent example in the Wallace Collection, London, and also show a preoccupation with the picturesque. Some of Dughet's best pictures are of this subject, in which the waterfalls trickling over the rocks are painted with great naturalism.This landscape combines Roman topography with the picturesque in a manner then particularly admired by English collectors

35690-grove.jpg	Ruisdael is one of the exceptional painters who appears on the scene as a precocious complete master. He was active as an independent artist before he was inscribed as a member of the Haarlem guild in 1648. More than a dozen of his works are signed and dated 1646, when he was a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old teenager, and in the following year the number increases.In these early works there is no fumbling or groping. On the contrary, from the beginning he surpasses his models by his ability to enlarge a detail of nature into central motif. The sand dunes and clumps of trees around his native town which were his favourite subjects during these years are rendered with loving care and from the moment we recognize his hand until his last years he gave unprecedented meticulous attention to arboreal details.

07670-carlev131.jpg	The View of a River Port is a fine example of Carlevaris's imaginary landscapes, painted shortly after his return to Venice from Rome and therefore datable to the first years of the eighteenth century. The painter has here assembled architectural motifs gathered from various places in the papal city. The arched bridge could be one of those over the Tiber, perhaps the Ponte Rotto, the equestrian monument is based on Bernini's Constantine and the houses in the background are a partial view of the Isola Tiberina. Although Carlevarijs was not interested in the precise representation of reality in this work as he was in his subsequent Venetian views, but rather assembled elements from life in an imaginary whole, the elements typical of his mature work are already evident, particularly in the central section with the quay flooded in sunlight and the lively characters painted in bright colours.This painting is a lovely composition that shows the essential traits of the artist's training, with a northern Baroque fondness for ruins and a central Italian form of scenographic landscape

05369-bouquet.jpg	This painting depicts a bouquet of flowers in a stone arch opening onto a landscape. It is one of the five paintings by Bosschaert depicting bouquets in open niches, mostly with a view of a landscape.Analysis of the flower pieces made by Bosschaert and other flower painters of his time reveals that their bouquets were seldom painted from life. They were assembled from a number of independent studies which serve as patterns. The pictures frequently show blossoms which bloom at different seasons of the year, and it is not unusual to find the same flower, shell, or insect in more than one picture. This manner of composing flower pieces was continued by later artists.

39460-4entombm.jpg	The church of San Giorgio Maggiore was built on the San Giorgio Island between 1566 and 1600 using the design of Palladio. After 1590 the workshop of Tintoretto was commissioned to paint big canvases for decorating it. Due the large number of commissions, Tintoretto in his late years increasingly relied on his coworkers. However, three surviving paintings placed in a chapel consecrated in 1592 - The Jews in the Desert, The Last Supper and Entombment - were certainly painted by Tintoretto himself.It is remarkable on this picture that the dead Christ and the fainted Mary is depicted in similar position in two different groups of figures. The representation of the figures is rather simplified, and therefore, the composition shows some similarity to late medieval, Venetian-Byzantine type passion scenes

32628-lamentat.jpg	Il Ges&#249;, the church of the Jesuits, was the largest church to have been built in 1568 in Rome since the sack of the city in 1527. The interior of the church is an open, single vessel barrel-vaulted space with truncated transepts, and a single wide apse. Side chapels line the nave and although there are connecting passages between them, they function as distinct spaces. The painted decoration of the chapels is among the earliest in Rome to respond to the concerns for clarity, historical accuracy, and compelling emotional impact voiced by the Council of Trent and its interpreters. The project of decoration was overseen by Giuseppe Valeriani (1542-1596), a Jesuit priest.The Lamentation was commissioned from Pulzone for the altar in the chapel dedicated to the Passion of Christ. This painting demonstrates the new style of religious art following the Council of Trent. In the Lamentation, Christ's body takes central place in the composition close to the picture plane. The close focus and the naturalistic rendering of the figures - red-eyed with weeping and yet decorously restrained - give immediacy to the drama as each figure shows a concentrated personal reaction to the event, inviting viewers to share their emotions. Despite the moderation in the movement of the figures and the carefully orchestrated rhetoric of poses and gestures, the glowing unblemished body of Christ giving no indication of the violence done to it - is placed against the brilliant red garment of Joseph of Arimethea, a purely painterly echo of his recent ordeal.The painting was most likely removed from the Ges&#249; in 1798 during the French occupation of Italy when virtually everything of value in the church was appropriated by the occupying forces

The venue was lit up as bright as day and decorated with mirrors, galleries and gaslights. In the middle was a large dance floor surrounded by a promenade, tables, and a garden.Between 1890 and 1896 the Moulin Rouge inspired Lautrec to no less than thirty paintings, which give us a better picture of the famous dance hall, its atmosphere and its clientele, than any photo-reportage could have achieved

44224-seasons1.jpg	Jacob de Wit, a leading representative of Dutch ceiling painting was responsible for a seasonal cycle commissioned by Landgrave Wilhelm VIII for the great galleried hall at Schloss Wilhelmsh�he. This cycle is characteristic of De Wit's works in grisaille, generally allegorical representations of putti, which were popular and internationally sought-after decorations. With their graduated greys, these works - sometimes called 'witjes', in a pun on the name Wit, meaning white - imitate stone bas-relief. The theoretical architectural function of the works is clearly expressed in their organisation as niches with a stele in each.The divinity appropriate to each of the seasons is represented by a bust on a plinth, while a small crowd of putti make merry play with the god's attributes. Spring is represented by Flora, her beautiful, symmetrical face is set among graceful garlands of flowers.

It is situated in the centre of the bottom row above the scene of Agony in the Garden.The Mount of Olives becomes the scene of unexpected agitation in Christ Taken Prisoner, containing three separate episodes: in the centre the kiss of Judas, to the left Peter cutting off the ear of the servant Malchus, to the right the flight of the apostles. The dramatic intensity of the scene, heightened by the crowded succession of spears, lanterns and torches, shows in the excited movements of the characters and the expressiveness of their faces. The landscape, after long being an anonymous feature of minor importance, takes on a new scenic role. The vegetation and rocky crags of Byzantine inspiration seem to be an integral part of the action: in the Agony in the Garden the three trees on the right isolate Christ, while in Christ Taken Prisoner they enclose the main episode, as if allowing the disciples to escape

23254-02tiver.jpg	The Santa Cristina al Tiverone Altarpiece, a Sacra Conversazione, is the most important work of Lotto's Treviso period. Its composition shows the knowledge of Giovanni Bellini's San Zaccaria Altarpiece.In contrast with the growing use of tonal gradation of light, which was particularly widespread in the province where Giorgione was born, Lotto seemed to wish to return to northern inspiration. Thus the strong, incisive line, the clear light and the severe expression of the figures match a compositional structure that was apparently traditional, but was, in fact, already affected by a feeling of unrest.The lunette represents the Dead Christ Surrounded by two Angels. The expressive power of it is noteworthy. The realism of this painting anticipates that of Caravaggio a century later

28904-poggio1.jpg	Of all the Medici villas in the environs of Florence, Poggio Imperiale has the most imposing site and is also closest to the Palazzo Pitti, which became the official residence of the grand dukes in 1561. The property came into the possession of Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565. From 1618 Maria Magdalena of Austria, the wife of Cosimo II de' Medici invested  a great sum on improvements made under the direction of Giulio Parigi. In 1624 the property was officially named Poggio Imperiale with reference to the grand duchess's imperial lineage. The lineage was also featured in the ambitious pictorial program of the public rooms and bedrooms which lay on the ground floor. However, the villa was stripped of its precious furnishings and art treasures from the seventeenth century under the Habsburg-Lorraine regency (1737-65).The decoration of Poggio Imperiale started again under the reign of Peter Leopold (1747-1792) who succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Tuscany when his eldest brother became emperor as Joseph II in 1765. This decoration was intended to set a new artistic direction and propagate new standards of taste: Neoclassicism.Three rooms in the south wing were frescoed in 1768-72 by Tommaso Gherardini and Giuliano Traballesi with the collaboration of Giuseppe del Moro, one of the best Tuscan perspective painters of the time. It was followed by the decoration of five rooms in the west wing in 1773-78. Here the frescoes were executed by Giuseppe Maria Terreni, Giuseppe Gricci, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini, and Tommaso Gherardini.The Sala di Diana is one of the grand duke's official rooms in the west wing. Its decoration, executed by Giuseppe Gricci (documented 1770-1785) and Giuseppe del Moro, is wholly devoted to landscape. Virtually unhindered by architectural elements, an atmospheric landscape panorama unfolds across all four walls. The painting is all-encompassing and extends upward unto the ceiling without interruption. On the ceiling above the landscape panorama is Apollo on the Chariot of the Sun, and Diana with Her Retinue.Images showing the decorations of the various rooms in the Villa Poggio Imperiale can be viewd on the respective pages of Tommaso Gherardini, Giuliano Traballesi, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Maria Terreni, and Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini

Both these pictures, done on a monumental scale, are of extreme originality and uncompromising realism.Ganymede was a shepherd, the son of Tros, a legendary king of Troy. His outstanding beauty caused Jupiter to fall in love with him. According to Ovid (Met. 10: 152-161) the god, having transformed himself into an eagle, carried the youth off to Olympus where he made him his cup-bearer. The myth, which is given in a slightly different version by Homer, found favour in ancient Greece because it appeared to provide religious sanction for homosexual love. The representation in Renaissance and later art shows Ganymede caught in the embrace of, or on the back of, the eagle which bears him upwards, its wings either spread in flight or enfolding the youth, its claws holding his limbs

39417-2roch.jpg	The death in prison of St Roch serves as the pretext for a pitilessly realistic depiction of a prison cell. As if in an image of hell, various levels of punishment can be made out. While the seated man in the left foreground is closely chained to the damp wall, the prisoner standing next to him can exchange a few words with the guard at the round hatch. A thief with his hand cut off as punishment is visible through the grating in the floor. A companion lowers food into this desolate dungeon. To the amazement of the prisoners, an angel of comfort comes flying in, unimpeded by the iron grating on the right of the cell.The flying angel was obviously painted from the same three-dimensional model as St Mark in The Miracle of the Slave of some 20 years earlier. Since even the hem of the garment fluttering up above the left calf is exactly the same in both paintings, we may assume that the wax or clay figure which served Tintoretto as model was clad in fabric stiffened with glue or plaster. The fragile model probably hung for decades from a beam in the roof of Tintoretto's dark, private laboratory, and was thus preserved from damage

21571-odysseus.jpg	"The fact that Lastman visited Italy and that, while he was there, he was profoundly influenced by Elsheimer, is evident in this painting of the shipwrecked Odysseus found naked by Nausicaa and her entourage. The pictorial structure, the individual gestures and formal pathos are theatrical, and the setting itself is charged with meaning. The artist has taken a highly original approach in placing the figures, with their gestures of surprise and fright and their outstretched arms, against a pale sky - a motif Rembrandt was soon to adopt. One thing, however, is particularly remarkable about this painting, and it foreshadows an element that is to emerge strongly in later Dutch painting: the element of the ""portrait histori�"". We have the impression here that a historic event is being played by specific persons, as though in a theatrical role. History painting and the reality of the protagonists are widely divergent.In this painting, the naked Odysseus not only looks like the great hero of the Trojan war, but he is also caricatured in his all too human role. Lastman increased the figurative detail of his staffage and with that the realism and narrative impact of his work. The young Rembrandt also adopted this sense of tension."

09666-1stufa4.jpg	"The picture shows one of the scenes in the Stanza della Stufa. This last Age of the series offers a scene rife with violence: two Roman soldiers are profaning a temple and killing a priest while others are slaughtering men and women, young and old, without remorse. Cortona does not, however, depict a completely corrupted, decadent society like the one Ovid had described. He preferred instead to retain a human aspect by presenting a number of innocent people who fall victim to their cruel predators.The Stanza della Stufa is a smaller room on the piano nobile that was one of the grand duke's private chambers. It took its name from its heated floor (""stufa"" means heater). Cortona painted here the Age of Gold and the Age of Silver on the north wall in 1637. The Age of Bronze and Age of Iron were realized only later in 1641. The iconographic concept is based on Ovid's Metamorphoses"

He has added a carefully rendered, elegant throne raised over three steps, which fills the greater part of the panel and produces a bold spatial statement. Its top takes the form of a hexagonal cupola, but this still has chiefly pointed arches and cannot be said to represent the architectural avant-garde of the time. Compared with his later depictions of architecture it lacks monumentality. There is no attempt to extend the picture space into the far distance or to heighten the realism further, as the background of the panel is rendered in plain gold in the trecento fashion

26076-22sorrow.jpg	Thanks to a late-fifteenth-century copy (with the addition of a background landscape) that has survived intact in the Mus�e des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg, we know for certain that this Man of Sorrows originally had a praying Virgin as its companion piece. A number of separate copies of the latter also survive. The best example in the series is to be found in the Uffizi in Florence. All the copies exhibit a similarly hard sculptural style that cannot have derived from the lost Memling painting. Until fairly recently, the Christ figure, too, was thought merely to have survived in copies.It was not until the Genoa panel came to attention at the 1947 exhibition in Florence that it was accepted by most art-historians as a Memling of high quality. The work does, indeed, exhibit the highly polished finish, anatomical definition and soft lighting of Memling's portraits. Christ wears a dark, purple-brown robe, and turns sorrowfully towards his mother, in the original right wing, to show his wounds. The droplets of blood, mixed with sweat, are rendered in a highly refined, transparent manner. Similar portrayals, albeit more frontal, are to be found in the circle of Dieric Bouts, especially in the work of Albert Bouts, where the type probably first arose. Memling's version is one of the most 'human' interpretations, because it presents Christ not as a terrible emblem of the Passion (with the king's cloak or cane from immediately after the Flagellation and the Crowning with Thorns), but as a sorrowful man who still bears the marks of his torture

20256-singeri3.jpg	"Singerie is the French word for ""Monkey Trick"". It is a genre depicting monkeys apeing human behaviour, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild satire. Singeries were popular among French artists in the early 18th century, though the term is most usually reserved for a type of decorative painting associated with French Rococo. It originated with the French decorator and designer Jean Berain, who included dressed figures of monkeys in many of his arabesque wall decorations. The emergence of singerie as a distinct genre, however, is usually attributed to the decorator Claude III Audran, who in 1709 painted a large picture of monkeys seated at table for the Ch&#226;teau de Marly. In France the most famous such rococo decor are Christophe Huet's Grande Singerie and Petite Singerie decors at the Ch&#226;teau de Chantilly.The six canvases by Huet, which depict monkeys dressed up as humans and engaged in various country leisure activities, originally formed part of the decor of a salon in the Ch&#226;teau de La Norville. The salon had paneling by the sculptor Nicolas Pineau, which framed the six singeries. In his design, Pineau positioned four of the canvases - The Fishermen, The Dance, The Picnic, and the Concert - as overdoors, while installing the remaining two - The Painter and The Sculptor - above pier glasses"

07131-ascensio.jpg	The picture shows the decoration of the vault of the cloister church San Paolo Converso in Milan.Illusionistic perspectival effects were the aim of the 'quadratura' painting. It built fictive structures in the vaults of churches and extended the walls of the space upward through imaginary painted vistas. The masterpiece in this genre is found in the convent church of San Paolo Converso in Milan. The long hall of the church is divided by a wall into an area for the laity in front and one for the nuns in the back. In the vault of the nuns' church Antonio and Vincenzo Campi depicted the Assumption of the Virgin in 1586-88, and Vincenzo painted the Ascension of Christ in the lay church in 1588. In each case the vault is united into a single large illusionistic architectural structure that opens through a shaft in the centre onto the heavens and the apotheosis of Christ or of Mary. Along the spring line of the vault there is a series of painted arches, offering places for the apostles as witnesses.The actual, simple room of the church in which viewers stand is enriched and made more splendid by this fictive architecture and is connected to the world in heaven by these illusionistic stages. The church is transformed into a holy site of divine epiphany thanks to the compelling power of the optical illusion. The centring the whole room on a single, dominant vision of heaven had countless successors in Baroque ceiling decoration

31910-domitill.jpg	Certainly not a breathtaking work, Pomarancio's painting is nevertheless an important historical document. It was painted around 1598-99 for an altar in the left transept of Santi Nereo e Achilleo in Rome. When he was appointed a cardinal in 1596, Cesare Baronio - who was intimately associated with the Congregation of the Oratory - chose this then rather dilapidated structure as his titular church. His reasons for doing so were twofold: firstly, its apparent simplicity fitted well with his publicly avowed modesty; and secondly, it was closely tied to the early, `heroic' phase of Christianity. Baronio also believed that St Gregory the Great, to whom the Oratory's initial church was also dedicated, had preached there. In 1599, in celebration of the reconstruction, which he had financed himself, Baronio had the relics of SS. Domitilla, Nereus and Achilleus returned from Sant'Adriano ai Fori (destroyed 1935), where they had been transferred in 1228 under Pope Gregory IX. All three martyrs are depicted in the painting.The central figure of St Domitilla is based on Raphael's St Cecilia (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna). Domitilla looks towards heaven as three angels swoop down holding wreaths. There is, however, a marked difference to Raphael's saint: Domitilla has been set in motion. Her left foot rests one step lower than her right, as if she were descending a staircase and approaching the spectator. This suggestion of movement is underlined by the fall of her drapery. She holds a palm frond in her right hand and is flanked by the two other saints, who are placed at a higher level and look directly at the viewer. Although Pomarancio's work conforms to all the conventions of the time, he has succeeded in enlivening it to such an extent that there seems to be real interaction between the saints and their audience. He thereby employs an artistic mode used to an even greater extent by the artists who followed him, including Caravaggio, Cavarozzi and Lanfranco

They formed the predella of the altarpiece. The two panels in Philadelphia depict the legend of Justus and Clement.The two saints escaped the Goths in North Africa and settled in Volterra, which they helped save from the invading Vandals by having the grain remaining in the city multiplied and then thrown at the invaders, who dispersed in confusion. The saints were venerated throughout Tuscany, but by the mid-fifteenth century some doubts seem to have developed about their legend.

08263-crucifix.jpg	The Roman school of the second half of the thirteenth century was also crucial to the development of Giotto's work and Italian painting in general. Critical recognition of this has come late but is growing steadily. Pietro Cavallini is the outstanding artist of his school, especially with regard to his innovative use of colour and light. In Rome he painted frescoes (the most important of which is the Last Judgment in S. Cecilia in Trastevere) and designed mosaics (Life of the Virgin in S. Maria in Trastevere, dating from 1291). The painter also worked for some time at the court in Naples where we still have his frescoes in the cathedral as well as in S. Maria Donna Regina and S. Domenico.

33426-69newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 598.Rembrandt's final word is given in his monumental painting of the Return of the Prodigal Son. Here he interprets the Christian idea of mercy with an extraordinary solemnity, as though this were his spiritual testament to the world. It goes beyond the works of all other Baroque artists in the evocation of religious mood and human sympathy. The aged artist's power of realism is not diminished, but increased by psychological insight and spiritual awareness. Expressive lighting and colouring and the magic suggestiveness of his technique, together with a selective simplicity of setting, help us to feel the full impact of the event.The main group of the father and the Prodigal Son stands out in light against an enormous dark surface. Particularly vivid are the ragged garment of the son, and the old man's sleeves, which are ochre tinged with golden olive; the ochre colour combined with an intense scarlet red in the father's cloak forms an unforgettable colouristic harmony. The observer is roused to a feeling of some extraordinary event. The son, ruined and repellent, with his bald head and the appearance of an outcast, returns to his father's house after long wanderings and many vicissitudes. He has wasted his heritage in foreign lands and has sunk to the condition of a swineherd. His old father, dressed in rich garments, as are the assistant figures, has hurried to meet him before the door and receives the long-lost son with the utmost fatherly love.The occurrence is devoid of any momentary violent emotion, but is raised to a solemn calm that lends to the figures some of the qualities of statues and gives the emotions of a lasting character, no longer subject to the changes of time. Unforgettable is the image of the repentant sinner leaning against his father's breast and the old father bending over his son. The father's features tell of a goodness sublime and august; so do his outstretched hands, not free from the stiffness of old age. The whole represents a symbol of all homecoming, of the darkness of human existence illuminated by tenderness, of weary and sinful mankind taking refuge in the shelter of God's mercy

36526-girleati.jpg	Godfried Schalcken studied with Gerard Dou in Leiden. This was around 1660, the period when Dou was concentrating on painting nocturnal scenes. These paintings, lit with scant candlelight, were universally praised; the representation of a light source and its associated reflections was regarded as a great artistic feat. The young Schalcken accepted the challenge and elected to specialise in scenes illuminated by candlelight, achieving an unequalled standard in this singular genre in a remarkable short space of time.This painting is a fine example of Schalcken's candlelit works. The subject is a mundane, domestic one: a girl, seated at a table, puts a piece of apple into her mouth. The scene is lit only by the flame of a candle. With extraordinary effectiveness Schalcken captured the phenomenon of the candlelight, with just a few reflections of the orange glow. Admirers wondered how the artist managed to pull off this feat. In the 18th century, an Englishman actually suggested that Schalcken had installed an enclosed cabin in his studio, lit only by a burning candle, where his model would sit. The painter was then said to have looked in through a peephole to paint the dimly lit scene.Schalcken's painting is not so minutely detailed as his teacher's. This is evident from the rendering of the Turkish carpet in the foreground. Dou would have painted it down to the tiniest detail, but Schalcken depicted it in small, powerful strokes in bright red, blue and yellow. The illusion of real knotted wool is in no way diminished by this - Schalcken's imitation of reality is at least as convincing as that of his illustrious predecessor

23856-3manet15.jpg	"It was Monet and Renoir who, each in turn, influenced Manet's series of ""ladies served on canap�s."" But this was a veritable interaction, with reciprocal exchanges and influences, for both Monet, in his Madame Monet on a Sofa (1871) and Madame Monet Reading (1872), and Renoir, in his Madame Monet Lying on a Sofa (1872), had deliberately modelled their paintings on Olympia, merely replacing her clothes. Manet, taking up the theme in their wake, did the same. Madame Manet on a Blue Sofa depicts his wife in full bourgeois regalia, but the arrangement of the torso and arms and even the flirtatiously placed hand were borrowed from his Olympia. This time, however, Manet's picture was resolutely Impressionist, the more so for his lively use of pastel.The use of pastel allowed Manet great contrasts of texture and colour, giving the picture an intensity and bloom that oil on canvas could not match. It was a medium to which Manet often returned, and his superlative technique resulted in numerous masterpieces.The apogee of the pastel was the eighteenth century, and it had been relatively little practiced since, confined, for the most part, to landscape, in the work of Boudin, Delacroix, and Millet. Manet adopted it under the prompting of Degas, who had made a number of successful pastel portraits"

35564-13arunde.jpg	Venetian ideas were decisive for the development of Rubens's painting style. Increasing conformity to that example is also shown by the flamboyance which Rubens from c. 1620 onwards began to lend with such emphases to his official portraits of foreign princes and aristocrats. The most remarkable example is perhaps is the Portrait of Lady Arundel with her Train.Both the picturesque embellishments added to this great portrait of the eccentric English countess, with her jester, her dwarf and her dog, and the theatrical baldachin and the view over open country, are typical of Titian's style.

07753-10ambass.jpg	"Canvas No. 1 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".The three paintings of the Ambassadors are evidence of the extent to which Carpaccio's feeling for colour had developed; in them the artist displays his extraordinary ability at directing or staging pageants and religious celebrations of the kind that must have been fairly frequent at the time.In the painting of the English Ambassadors' Arrival a at the Court of the King of Brittany, the first episode of the cycle of Stories from the Life of St Ursula, the splendid architectural setting, with the open loggia against the background of a view of Venice and the intimate space of the private room, divides the scene into two sections: the ambassadors deliver their message on one side and Ursula discusses the matter with her father on the other. The entire composition is arranged with absolute self-confidence and accuracy.In the diplomatic ceremony the afternoon light streams in from the left and illuminates the foreground, with patches of bright colours and sharp shadows. Below the wide portico that stretches out to the left with a row of arcades vanishing into the distance, alternating with areas of shadow, the elegant young members of the Compagnia della Calza are portrayed in poses of the most self-assured nonchalance, and showing indifference for what is happening nearby.To the right of the elaborate candelabrum, with marble and bright metal decorations, a sophisticated ornamentation that is reminiscent of the work of Ferrarese artists, the English ambassadors are received by King Maurus; they are portrayed in attitudes of deference and respect, in keeping with the rigid protocol governing public audiences granted by the Venetian Republican institutions at the time. The King sits, like the Doge, amidst his counsellors on a judgment seat against a wall covered in precious ornamented leather hangings, placed at an angle to the light and opening out onto a view of the city dominated by a round domed temple-like construction, reminiscent of Perugino and almost anticipating Baldassarre Longhena's Santa Maria della Salute. Just as the colours of the architecture are reflected in the water, so the shadows of the small figures fall like dark stripes on the red brick and white marble expanse of the square bathed in warm sunlight.Although the buildings and the landscape are quite definitely Venetian in character, it is not possible to identify them as specific constructions. And even the many identifications of the people in the painting with contemporaries of Carpaccio's are all purely hypothetical. The most fascinating theory is the identification of the man in the red cloak to the left, outside the main scene of the event, looking towards the spectator: he is traditionally supposed to be either Pietro Loredan, one of the patrons who commissioned the decoration of the Scuola, or a self-portrait. He stands in front of the iron banister enclosing the scene and appears almost to be drawing our attention towards the ambassadors and their message; like the young boy with the long feather on his cap who also looks out towards the spectator, a detail that was only recently (1983) rediscovered thanks to an excellent cleaning job. The nurse sitting at the far right in an attitude of resignation, on the other hand, introduces us to the conversation between Maurus and his daughter, which does not take place in an elegant and formal hall like the audience of the ambassador, but in the domestic intimacy of Ursula's bedroom.The King has abandoned all the official royal formalities imposed by protocol and simply listens to the conditions set out by his daughter. She will marry Ereus if she is granted a retinue of ten beautiful virgins; she and each of the ten shall further be assigned a thousand virgins each; and the young man who has asked for her hand shall be baptized and instructed in the faith for a period of three years. The two figures, father and daughter, are set against the canopy of the bed and the wall decorated with a devotional icon in an inversion of patches of colour that is almost an anticipation of the art of Paolo Veronese. And the harmony of colours with which Carpaccio depicts the old governess is equally masterful: she sits at the foot of the stairway leading to Ursula's bedroom and stares out into space, as though she knew what a tragic ending this royal wedding contract would lead to. Years later Titian was obviously so struck by this figure of the governess that he included a modern version of her in the Presentation of the Virgin that he painted between 1536 and 1538 for the Scuola Grande di Santa Maria della Carit&#224;"

20458-port_boy.jpg	This painting was initially attributed to Antonello da Messina, then to Andrea Solario, Alvise Vivarini and Giovanni Bellini. Most of the pictures today widely accepted to be by Jacometto have undergone similar vicissitudes.The mysterious Jacometto is an artist who is hard to classify, not least because of the extent and range of influences of other artists that are traceable in his oeuvre. Jacometto must have known the realistic and Netherlandish-influenced portraiture of Antonello da Messina, who traveled to Venice in 1475-76: the Portrait of a Boy evinces a very immediate reaction to Antonello.

Some appear to have been previously unaware of Monet's presence in the village, but at least two of them, Robinson and Metcalf, had visited during earlier summers. They set up their easels along the streams or on the hillside and became acquainted with their newly adopted village from a distance. At first they avoided depicting the village itself, preferring more familiar landscape motifs. Gradually, artists in Giverny began to experiment with Impressionism, inspired by Monet and also by the region's dramatic light. Within a few years, many began to employ the more luminous, high-keyed palette and looser brushwork characteristic of impressionism

07915-heracles.jpg	"This imposing canvas originally decorated the ceiling of the ""Camerino"", the study of Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, on the second floor in Rome's Palazzo Farnese. Its basic idea agreed with the purpose of the room; thus it became the central piece of decoration. In the oval and semicircular flat fields of the vaulted ceiling decorated with frescoes were depicted episodes from Heracles' life, other mythological stories with morals, and the allegories of virtues.The Prodicusian story tells of the maturing Heracles, who had to choose between virtue and sin, between the difficult path of duty and decency, and the temptation of irresponsibility and pleasure. The story had several classical versions: Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana had the most relevance in sixteenth-century Italy, because its Latin translation was published there in 1501. Though it had been altered somewhat, the text of this work served as the basis for Annibale Carracci's tradition-creating painting.In the picture the ideal of virtuous life is represented by the pursuit of fine arts or sciences. The dual classification of virtues, according to merits achieved in war or in the cultivation of the sciences, was a Renaissance method based on classical examples (e.g. Macrobius; Commentarii . . .). Wearing a laurel wreath and reading a book, the man who reclines in the left foreground like one of the classical river gods is the ""poeta laureatus"", while in the background Pegasus is visible. Based on these references, it is implied that the dull and winding road of virtue in fact leads to the hill of the Muses, Mount Helicon.Contrasting with this image is the frivolously dressed, beautiful personifier of sin, who entices one with the symbols of a playful life toward the depths of the flowery, green forest. The presence of playing-cards, a tambourine and a stringed instrument represents the arsenal of Voluptas. The two theatrical masks on the opened sheet of music are placed there to imply that every sensual pleasure is false. These symbols do not appear in Philostratus' text, but the Iconologia of Cesare Ripa prescribes that these specifically represent pleasure and shame (scandalo) in painting.The fresco series of the Palazzo Farnese, this impressive creation of Rome's Baroque painting, continued to exert great influence on the subsequent interpretations of ""The Choice of Heracles"" theme.

23150-port_wom.jpg	This painting reflects an important step in the evolution of Florentine portraits of women: earlier examples almost always show them bust-length and in profile. The change came about in the mid-1470s in the work of the young Leonardo da Vinci and, slightly later, in the work of Botticelli. In the new format, women turn their faces toward the spectator, giving artists greater opportunity to suggest their personalities. By increasing the length of portraits, artists could also include the hands and show the sitters in more natural poses. The catalyst for this change seems to have been Verrocchio's Lady with Primroses.An old inscription on the back of the panel identifies the sitter as Ginevra d'Amerigo de' Benci, the same young woman whom Leonardo depicted in a portrait. Lorenzo di Credi's painting is clearly inspired by Leonardo's portrait

18557-3jaffa.jpg	Gros was only fourteen when he became a pupil of Jaques-Louis David, after having received instruction from his father, a miniature painter. In 1793, accused of royalist tendencies, he had to flee to Italy, where he lived mainly in Florence and Genoa, making a living from miniatures and portraits. After returning to France in 1799, Gros painted colossal and highly acclaimed battle scenes to celebrate Napoleon's martial prowess, including Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Stricken at Jaffa and Napoleon on the Battlefield at Eylau.This vast scene, full of warmth and lyricism, is a good example of the interest in the Orient instigated by Napoleon's battle campaigns. The subject-matter is actually little more than political propaganda, but its execution and the strong emotional appeal achieved by the simple treatment of the victims' fevered rapture, renders this canvas the first great success of Romanticism in painting

18711-1ospeda3.jpg	Guarana's painting decorates the music room (Sala della Musica) of the Ospedaletto church.

24010-zeno1p.jpg	The painting formed the central panel of the predella of the San Zeno Polyptych. The three original predella panels are now in France (in Paris and Tours), they were appropriated as war booty during the Napoleonic war. In Verona, the predella panels were replaced by canvas copies during the 19th century.The scene takes place on a cracked rocky plateau on Golgotha. The place of execution is marked by holes in the rock, that had already been used for other crosses. At the foot of Christ's cross lies the skull of Adam, the first man. According to legend, Adam's grave was at Calvary and was exposed by the earthquake when Christ died.

44770-stil_lif.jpg	This painting depicts a fine white ceramic cup filled with water, resting on a silver saucer, adorned with a single rose on a wooden tabletop. The flower here could refer to rose water, a perfumed drink popular in the 17th century, or have a deeper, religious significance. The motif of the cup filled with water is familiar from other works by Zurbaran: it appears in his famous still-life of 1633, Still-Life with Basket of Oranges (Norton Simon Museum of Art, Pasadena) and in at least two of his religious paintings. In the latter paintings the cup of water and rose allude to the Virgins purity and love. The flower could also be interpreted as an emblem, referring to the Virgin as the Mystic Rose.This canvas is a fragment of a larger work: the left-hand edge is intact, while the other three sides have been cut

35848-marine.jpg	Despite the traditional title given in the nineteenth century, the subject of this painting is transport on a river, not on a bay. On the left bank of the river is a village and a Late Gothic church of a type common in Holland. On the right bank, a boat with lowered sails is moored by a farmhouse. The sailboat in the foreground, flying the Dutch flag, is a 'schouw', one of a few types of shallow-draft vessel that were used to ship goods and occasionally passengers between towns on the inland waterways.Comparable river views, filled almost entirely by sky and water, were painted by Jan van Goyen beginning in the late 1630s. He was probably influenced by Jan Porcellis, to whom he sold a house in 1629. This type of composition became especially common about 1650 in the work of Jan van Goyen, Salomon van Ruysdael, and their minor followers

18353-1504grec.jpg	El Greco's representations of St Francis were highly popular in Spain. El Greco no longer depicted the saint, as was previously common, at the moment of his stigmatization, that is, his miraculous reception of Christ's wounds, but in the process of musing over a skull. The founder of the Jesuit order, Ignatius of Loyola, had recommended the use of a skull in meditational practices in his Spiritual Exercises.No one had captured the figure of the order's founder as described in the chronicles like El Greco, about forty versions of whose composition are still in existence even today. Two other factors probably also contributed to its extraordinary success: first, the great veneration enjoyed by St Francis in Spain - in Toledo alone, there were ten Franciscan religious institutions - and second, the recourse to modern media of dissemination.This painting is one of the many representations of St Francis by El Greco in which the saint is shown with Brother Leo, his faithful companion, at the entrance to a cave on Mount Alverna, where towards the end of his life St Francis retired for fasting and prayer. There exist some forty versions of this successful composition, consisting of autograph works, workshop paintings, early variants and copies. Because El Greco knew from Italy how important reproduction prints were in popularizing new visual ideas, he had an engraving done of his work in 1606 under his supervision by his pupil Diego de Astor.This version is an autograph work, it was intended for personal devotion, and El Greco has placed the skull virtually in the centre of the composition, and frontally, so that it acts as the focus for the viewer's meditation.
