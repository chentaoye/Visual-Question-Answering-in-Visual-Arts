30647-navalvic.jpg	The Sala dello Scrutinio (Voting Hall) is the second largest hall of the Doge's Palace. The balloting and secret votes of the magistracies and the doge took place in this hall with the very complicated systems that the Venetian Republic had created to avoid intrigues and subterfuge during the elections and, above all, to ensure that the vote could not be bought especially from the poor nobility in favour of its richer equivalent.The iconographic theme of the hall of the Sala dello Scrutinio was inspired by the Venetian naval victories on the Eastern seas shown in the numerous ceiling canvases depicting virtues and symbolic figures. Sante Peranda's painting is on the wall of the Sala dello Scrutinio, it depicts the naval victory of the Venetians at Jaffa against the Egyptians

42296-0714vela.jpg	For reasons of religious scruple, the female nude was rarely represented in Spanish art, although the royal collection was rich in mythological nudes by Titian and other Venetian Renaissance masters. The Toilet of Venus, called the 'Rokeby Venus' after Rokeby Hall in Yorkshire where it hung in the nineteenth century, is the only surviving picture of this kind by Vel�zquez - one other, now lost, is recorded - and remained unique in Spain until Goya depicted the Naked Maja, which was probably inspired by it. Painted either just before or during Vel�zquez's second visit to Italy in 1648-52, the Venus was recorded in 1651 in the collection of the young son of Philip IV's prime minister, famous both for his womanising and his patronage of art. He was later to become Marqu�s of Carpio and later still Viceroy of Naples, and it must have been his standing at court which enabled him to commission such a painting without fear of the Inquisition.If the subject of this picture is a conflation of the Venetian Renaissance inventions of 'Venus at her mirror with Cupid' and 'Reclining Venus', its all-pervasive theme is reflection. Venus reflects on her beauty, reflected in the mirror; since we can dimly see her face, we know that ours can be seen by her, and she may be thought to reflect on the effect her beauty has on us. Vel�zquez has reflected long before his canvas and the living model - for this girl, with her small waist and jutting hip, does not resemble the fuller, more rounded Italian nudes inspired by ancient sculpture, and she wears her hair in a modern style. Only the presence of the plumply and innocently deferential Cupid transforms her into a goddess. The painter has moulded her body with infinitely scrupulous and tender gradations of colour, white, pink, grey and muted black and red, and the grey-black satin which reflects on her luminous skin itself shimmers with pearly reflections of flesh-tones. Streaks of pink, white and grey loop in ribbons around the ebony frame of the mirror. Even more astonishing is the single brushstroke, laden with black paint, tracing the line that runs beneath her body from the middle of the back to below her calf. Both the exact notation of appearance and such free and spontaneous touches are the fruit of lengthy meditation and practice.The very genesis of the painting may have been an act of reflection. The suggestion has been made that it was designed as a harmonious contrast to a nude Dana&#235; (later transformed into a Venus) attributed to Tintoretto. By 1677 both were incorporated, probably as a pair, in the decoration of a ceiling in one of Carpio's palaces. The Dana&#235;-Venus, recently rediscovered in a private collection in Europe, is of nearly identical dimensions and a virtual mirror image of Vel�zquez's Venus: the figure reclining in a landscape in the same pose, but facing the viewer, and on red drapery. The witty reversal echoes Titian's procedure in the mythological poesie ('poems') painted for Philip IV's grandfather Philip II and still in the royal collection, in which he promised to show the different aspects of the naked female form. But, typically of Vel�zquez, in this haunting successor to the more sensuous and exuberant Renaissance works, the narrative and the poetry consist in the act of looking and being looked at.During the Inquisition pictures were censored and artists who painted licentious or immoral paintings were excommunicated, fined very heavily and banished. Rather than punish so notable an artist as Vel�zquez, his Venus was accepted. Cupid and the face to be seen in the looking-glass were, in all probability, strongly overpainted in the eighteenth century.The toilet of Venus is a timeless theme of sensuous seduction. You can view other depictions of Venus at Her Toilet in the Web Gallery of Art

42718-shipwrek.jpg	Vernet's repertoire was a limited one, consisting of landscapes, more-or-less reminiscent of Tivoli with its picturesque hills, overhanging rocks, waterfalls, and pastoral staffage; or more commonly marines, showing a rocky Italianate coastline, usually populated with fisherfolk, or a seaboard tamed by the hand of man into harbour with a mole and lighthouse reminiscent of Naples and represented at different times of day and in different weather conditions. Within this formulaic types, there was a considerable variety of pictorial motifs, which Vernet could mix and match with such a degree of invention that in an oeuvre of about two thousand paintings he never exactly repeated himself, except when he may have made an autograph replica.

12307-4bern.jpg	A feeling of tenderness permeates the radiant Madonna of Bern, where the Virgin and Child are portrayed in a loving embrace. The gesture of intimate affection is taken from Byzantine iconography, from the motif of the Glykophilousa, in which Mary, with a presentiment of the sad future, clasps the Infant Jesus urgently to her breast. A closer reference can be seen in the Madonna in Bologna on which Duccio worked as an assistant of Cimabue, but its size and the barely indicated gesture greatly reduce the sense of intimate tenderness. The typology of the throne, decorated with Cosmati-like inlays and already experimented in several variations in the window of the apse, follows the lines of Gothic architecture, while the characteristic curling edge of Mary's dress evens out into a smooth gilt border

32765-04oddi1.jpg	Extant drawings demonstrate the tremendous amount of thought which Raphael put into the realization of the Oddi Altarpiece and some details, notably the highly individual faces of the Apostles and the serene landscape in the background, are quite masterful. But the most meaningful passages are found in the predella scenes: the vast space which opens out beneath the colonnades of the Annunciation; the highly animated Adoration of the Magi; and the free quality of the atmosphere in the Presentation in the Temple, which foreshadows the extraordinary spatial intuition of some of the artist's future Vatican compositions

28628-1vario03.jpg	After a few pictures painted in the 1860s, Monet dispensed almost entirely with figures in his works, devoting himself to landscape painting. However, when he did include large figures in his landscape paintings, as started to happen again in the 1880s, he treated them as if they were an element in the landscape. Around the mid-1880s, Monet reverted to the beginnings of his career as an artist and took up figure painting once more.In the two open air studies, Woman with a Parasol, Turned to the Left, and Woman with a Parasol, Turned to the Right, Monet was fascinated by the very low viewpoint from which the model is shown; she stands on a riverbank against a background of pale blue sky. The young woman in both pictures is Suzanne Hosched�, one of the daughters of Alice Hosched�, who was to become Monet's second wife in 1889.

32296-1sacram3.jpg	This is one of the first set of Sacraments, painted for Cassiano dal Pozzo. The picture was the last of the set to be completed, and is quite unlike the other surviving five.Almost as soon as he arrived in Rome, Poussin was fortunate enough to come into contact with the scholarly and benevolent Cassiano dal Pozzo, who was to be his patron for the next thirty years until his death in 1657. Their relationship in its early years seems to have consisted mainly of Pozzo collecting a number of Poussin's first works, almost out of charity for the struggling young artist, as the pictures were indeed of modest pretensions. In the later 1630s the catalyst for a development towards an extreme was undoubtedly Cassiano dal Pozzo, who commissioned Poussin to paint his first set of Sacraments.The dates of execution for this first set are unknown, but they were not completed until 1642, when the final one was sent by Poussin from Paris to Rome. Cassiano owned a Poussin executed in the late 1630s, a Baptism of Christ now in the Getty Museum at Malibu, and it may well have been this carefully calculated composition which spurred Cassiano on to commission Poussin to create the Sacraments, one of the most important single commissions of his career. The seven pictures, though executed over several years, were intended to be seen together, presumably in a relatively small room. Five of them - Marriage, Extreme Unction, Confirmation, Ordination and Eucharist - are now at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire, hung in different places in the house; the sixth, Baptism, is in the National Gallery of Art, Washington; and the seventh, Penance, was lost in the fire which destroyed Belvoir in 1816. It is difficult to know whether Poussin worked out his artistic theories after he had solved his problems on canvas, or whether he thought in the abstract and tried to prove his point by painting to a chosen formula. Whatever the explanation, the result was an extremely cerebral approach, epitomized by this first set of Sacraments.In spite of his great rigidity of theory, and in spite of some very dry pictures in which there seems to be little feeling of any kind, a surprisingly large number of Poussin's best pictures are tense with emotion. This is nowhere better seen than in the first set of Sacraments: it is as if all Poussin's energies and ideas are concentrated in these relatively small canvasses.The Sacraments, a microcosm of Poussin's art, reveal his working methods. It is known that he kept a small box rather like a miniature theatre, in which he arranged wax models and altered the lighting in order to help him with the layout of his complex compositions. He then made numerous rough drawings, trying out the compositions until the final solution was reached. It is easy to see that all the interior scenes of the Sacraments are arranged like a theatrical tableau, which gives them their curiously static quality and enhances their gravity

40344-3green.jpg	"After 1446 Uccello painted some further scenes in the Green Cloister in Santa Maria Novella in Florence: stories from the life of Noah, including the Flood and the Waters Subsiding, Noah's Sacrifice and his Drunkenness. Ever since Vasari all critics have always praised the complicated perspective composition of these scenes.

39814-12selfpo.jpg	This painting has been given a variety of dates ranging from the early 1550s to the 1560s. The manner in which the white is applied as a thick mass of paint in irregular and occasionally very large sections is reminiscent of Titian's style in about 1560, but the painting was not completed. There is only a suggestion of where his left hand is. It is interesting that he omitted any reference to his occupation. The only biographical allusion is the golden chain, the sign of his knighthood.Comparing this painting with the later self-portrait in the Prado, the latter shows Titian as withdrawn and distant in near profile, in contrast to the self-portrait in Berlin, where he appears without the tools of his trade but as if staring critically at an unseen canvas as described by Palma Giovane

06360-01prover.jpg	Although individual proverbs and groups of proverbs had been represented in Flemish art before, this is the first picture to create a whole world of them. These traditional sayings, of which there are numerous contemporary compilations, are of two principal types.Firstly, those which turn reason on its head, thereby showing the absurdity of much human behaviour; these have for their symbol the world turned upside-down, represented by the upturned orb on the house-sign on the left.The second type, which have a more serious, moralizing tone, illustrate the dangers of folly, which can lead to sin - for example, the woman who hangs a blue coat on her husband (that is, cuckolds him) and, just above, the man 'lighting candles for the devil'. Other proverbs illustrated include: 'He blocks up the well after the calf is drowned' (centre, bottom; 'One shears the sheep, another the pig' (left, bottom); 'One holds the distaff which the other spins' (that is, spreading evil gossip; centre, middle); 'The pig has been stuck through the belly' (centre, middle); 'He throws roses to the swine' (centre); 'He brings baskets of light into the daylight' (top).The collecting of proverbs was one of the many encyclopaedic undertakings in the 16th century. Bruegel is offering more than a simple catalogue here: he presents us with a topsy-turvy world, with the Devil seen in the centre of the picture hearing someone's confession

24890-triptyc2.jpg	It is unusual for the decoration on the backs of the wings to play an important thematic role in the visual programme of a triptych like this, but it does so in this case. When the triptych is closed one is presented with a moving depiction of Christ carrying the Cross, painted on a layer of red which was usually the support for gold leaf. Here the central motif has been isolated from the theme of the Carrying the Cross, which was of crucial importance for Late Medieval devotion.

29584-madonna.jpg	The artist conceived this unusual painting as a false polyptych, with the canvas divided into compartments that are separated by illusionistically painted late gothic portal colonettes. This is one of the most significant of the ten or fifteen surviving examples of this technique, which spread through east central Italy and the Veneto during the second half of the fifteenth century. The work has been stylistically connected to Niccol&#242;'s sojourn in the Marche region, and shows his knowledge of the works of Vivarini. The dating is based on a stylistic comparison with the 1465 Cagli polyptych (now at Breda) and with the triptych of the Cathedral of Assisi, the latter of which dates to 1468, the same date that has been assigned to this painting

37954-m_party.jpg	"Jan Steen was  one of the most popular of the Dutch masters of the seventeenth century. His gay and animated genre-scenes were highly appreciated, both by his contemporaries and by collectors in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He was a pupil of Nicolaus Kn�pfer in Utrecht and of his father-in-law, Jan van Goyen, and lived and worked for varying periods of time in nearly every large town in Holland.His range of subjects was extremely wide; he painted both villages and towns, peasants and well-to-do citizens; his vividly coloured, broadly constructed compositions depict taverns, sick-rooms, fairs, workshops and weddings, mythological and historical scenes in the spirit of the Dutch oratorical groups of his time, as well as character figures and a few portraits.Steen often depicted his family and himself, as indeed he has done in this picture, where he, his wife and his children are seen carousing. The work gets its alternative title of ""The Cat Family"" from the basket of new-born kittens held by the girl at the back of the circle.This picture splendidly summarizes the art of Steen - and Dutch genre as a whole. The centre of the family circle is the cat family in the basket on the table. Everybody is happy, gay and completely relaxed. The artist indicates our senses as the main source of pleasure: hearing makes us enjoy music; the sense of touch enables us to enjoy stroking the cats; the sense of taste and smell are satisfied by drinking; and our sight conveys the delight of reading an amusing story. The latter joy is represented by the figure of the artist himself, for the reader is a self portrait. The pleasing figure of a woman seen with her back to the onlooker could be the pleasure-giving muse of genre painting-if genre painting ever had such a muse. And if there were no such muse, then she must be considered to be Steen's most captivating figure of a woman, whose face, however, was apparently not worthy of the painter's brush."

25935-0view.jpg	The Santuario della Santa Casa (Sanctuary of the Holy House) at Loreto was constructed in the fifteenth century to enshrine the Holy House (Santa Casa) of the Virgin Mary, which tradition held had been brought from the Holy Land to Loreto by angels in the fourteenth century. The heart of the sanctuary is an unprepossessing brick chapel, said to be the structure in which the Virgin Mary was born, received the Annunciation, lived with Joseph and her child after returning from Egypt, and finally died in the presence of the twelve apostles.In its layout, the shrine consists of three-aisle arms ending in apses to the north, east, and south, and a six-bay nave extending to the west. The chapels off the nave were added only after 1507, by Bramante. Around the crossing, with the Santa Casa in the centre, are four octagonal rooms, closed off by doors, that are referred to simply as sacristies. Two of the four were painted in the fifteenth century, the Sacristy of St John by Luca Signorelli, and the Sacristy of St Mark by Melozzo da Forli.There is a close connection between the gospel texts and the pictorial programs of the two painted sacristies. The paintings in the Sacristy of St Mark focus on the Passion, appropriately, since it is Mark who describes it in the greatest detail. The Gospel of St John, by contrast, places particular emphasis on the gathering of Christ's disciples and the mission of the apostles, and this is reflected in the paintings of the Sacristy of St John.In Luca Signorelli's Sacristy of St John in Loreto, one is struck by the monumental figures in the wall compartments. In the Sacristy of St Mark, by contrast, it is the vaulting, with its deep, vivid colours, that immediately captures the viewer's attention. This eight-part Gothic vaulting is one of the most astonishing examples of monumental illusionistic wall painting from the fifteenth century. The wall area below it is conceived as an open arcade, the deep, coffered faces of its arches rendered in dramatic perspective. Through these wide arches, seen from below, one could at one time look out at seven scenes from the Passion, only one of which, Christ's entry into Jerusalem, survives

13458-hagar.jpg	In the nineteenth century this painting was believed to be one of Rembrandt's works; later it was attributed to Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol, and currently it is considered to be by Carel Fabritius.Hagar, the Egyptian hand maiden of Sarah was the mother of Ishmael, Abraham's first son. When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born, Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ishmael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water nearby, so they were both saved. Two scenes, the banishment, and the appearance of the angel are common in 17th century Italian and Dutch painting

02617-02arella.jpg	While paintings of flowers in a vase represented the most conventional type of flower piece in the 17th century, in the pair of Vase of Flowers, now in the same private collection, Arellano has depicted particularly rich arrangements in remarkably ornate bulbous glass vases with gilt mounts. The paintings could be surrogates for actual flower arrangements in the homes of wealthy contemporaries.The apparently natural floral arrangements seen in these paintings were the result of Arellano's careful ordering of the flowers. He derived this type of composition from his study of earlier Flemish flower paintings and prints, and varied it little throughout his career. It is hard to distinguish the flowers he painted from nature from those deriving from other pictures, graphic sources, memory and practice.While the repetitive nature of Arellano's still-lifes would not have been noticed in his own time, when his works were dispersed among different collections, this factor is augmented in pictures united by photography and exhibitions

17486-6norfol3.jpg	"The two wings represent the donors of a triptych, the central panel of which, conserved at the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia, shows a Virgin and Child. Probably man and wife, they are kneeling on ""prie-dieus"". She is looking to the left and has her hands joined, he is looking at the viewer and is holding a psalter. The couple is richly dressed - a distinctive sign of its high social position - but also soberly. The donatrix is enveloped in a white veil and wears a black, lined robe with red braiding and sleeves, revealing a slightly transparent chemisette, and with a fur thrown over her shoulders. The donor wears a fur-lined coat, a brown jacket and a white shirt with a finely embroidered collar.The d�cor is severe and classical. The disparity of architecture and the very different attitudes of the two donors is explained by the unequal relationship of the couple with the Virgin, represented on the central panel. The woman was originally in the same space as the Mother and Child, kneeling directly in front of them. The man, on the other hand, was in an adjoining room. For this reason it has been suggested that the donor commissioned the triptych in memory of his dead young wife, depicted together with the Madonna in the Kingdom of Heaven. She is a virgo mediatrix. On the reverse of the wings, ""trompe-l'oeil"" labels on a marbled background carry the first verse of the 51st psalm: ""Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions"".The work belongs to the very sought-after type of the devotional triptych for private use, made up of ""bust"" portraits, supposedly invented by Rogier van der Weyden. The extraordinary luminosity of the donors' faces and hands places these portraits among Gossart's best. The beauty of the modelling reminds us how much the artist owed, not only to antique art and to the Italian and German engravers, but also to Jan van Eyck, an artist whom he copied on several occasions, and whose extreme concern for detail he also borrowed. The triptych was painted probably between 1525 and 1532. After the death in 1524 of his main sponsor, Duke Philip of Burgundy, Gossart appears to have specialised in more standard works for a broader client�le"

20375-15ingres.jpg	"Ingres was Jacques-Louis David's most celebrated pupil. His severe classical style and his meticulous working procedure epitomized the academic tradition, which he defended vehemently against the French Romantic movement, led by Eug�ne Delacroix.

20371-12ingres.jpg	Ingres attempted in 1827 a historical synopsis in his great composition, the Apotheosis of Homer. This canvas was originally a ceiling decoration in the Salle Clarac in the Louvre.The most famous artists in history are depicted here: Dante and Moli�re and painters such as Poussin, but Homer reigns above them all. This assembly of great artists and writers of all ages gathered to honour the ancient Greek poet before a classical temple might look the epitome of hierarchical academicism. The painting was intended as the sum of all aesthetic rules. However, it could hardly live up to the expectations.

38304-sin.jpg	Franz von Stuck combined originality with enormous popularity. He conveyed his own advanced, often explicitly sexual imagery in singularly unthreatening fashion. His oeuvre has a strong sense of plasticity bringing him close to such contemporaries as Bourdelle and Maillol.Von Stuck devoted many canvases to Sin, which was among his favourite and most profitable themes, and he often provided them with lovingly designed frames. In the present 1893 version, Sin, sister of Eve - or Eve herself - flashes her torso, a suitably phallic serpent slung over the Original Sinner's shoulder like a fox stole. By 1897, sexual associations with this image were made more overt by having the serpent writhe between Sin's legs

09427-3medlars.jpg	Except for the artists who made the exact drawings and watercolours of birds, plants, insects, and shells which were so popular with 'dilettanti' of the period, the Dutch tradition of painting unpretentious still-lifes virtually died during the eighteenth century. Adriaen Coorte, a strong individualist who never adopted the rhetoric of his contemporaries, was one of the last practitioners of this intimate category.The exquisite flowers and fruit, expensive vases and metalware, drapery and linen, and other props found in the over-abundant still-lifes painted during his day hardly ever appear in his work. His inclination was for common, reddish-brown earthenware pots, not imported porcelain bowls. Coorte's pictures are always tiny, his subjects and compositions modest. His typical motifs are a bunch of asparagus, a few peaches, or three medlars with a butterfly on a bare ledge, like in this picture. Nothing more. Objects and light are studied intensely, and are painted with a wondrous tenderness which awakens more feelings about the mystery of our relation to the animate and inanimate world than the better-known show-pieces of the period.Coorte is an isolated phenomenon. The main line of eighteenth-century Dutch still-life painting is represented by the Amsterdamers Rachel Ruysch and Jan van Huysum, who both specialized in elaborate flower and fruit pictures

27161-mildorf1.jpg	The Holy Spirit church in the city of Sopron, Hungary has two side-altars. One is the Holy Cross altar, about which the 1782 contract drawn up with the painter, Istv�n Dorffmaister and the sculptor, Ferenc M�ller has remained to us. The other is the Piet&#224; altar decorated by the picture exhibited here. Very early in the year 1783 a cabinet-maker was paid for having dissembled and reassembled the high altar and the two sidealtars in 1782. One of the (old) side-altars may have been the Piet&#224; one whose altarpiece was perhaps made at the same time with the high altar's painting (cat. no 108�, as its technique of execution suggests. We consider both that altarpiece and this side-altarpiece as works made in the 1750's by Joseph Ignaz Mildorfer.18th century Piet&#224; compositions usually feature few figures: in most of them, there is but an angel to share the grief of Mary shown broken over her dead son. However, the Sopron altarpiece was composed by its painter from five figures, arranging St. John supporting Mary, Mary Magdalene wiping Christ's wounds and a woman embracing his hanging arm around the central figure of Christ himself lying in her mother's lap. The picture's basic tone is grim and dark. Its figures are almost bodyless. Glaring lights illuminate the faces depicted in sharp foreshortening and some widely fluttering draperies that make the composition almost burst. The figures of the windblown vision are mostly linked by the strange expressive forms of the strongly accentuated hands in a feature characteristic of Mildorfer's art in the style of the 1750s. His painting at Sopron is not related to his early Piet&#224; (St. Moritzen bei Telfs, 1742) but rather to the sketch at Graz, similarly unquiet in the intensity of expression (Graz, Joanneum). Here again, similarly to many other works of his. Mildorfer set out from a composition by Troger: his figure of Christ is almost a paraphrase of Troger's Piet&#224; in Vienna (Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien), yet without the latter's power of plasticity and confidence of composition

39283-6cassia2.jpg	Tintoretto used a print by Coornhert made from a design by Maerten van Heemskerck, as the model for his own depiction of the crucified Christ. He adopted the attitude of the body of Heemskerck's Christ almost unchanged, and also the ends of the loincloth hanging down between the legs. He did change the position of the head: while Heemskerck shows the dead Christ's head sunk on his breast, in Tintoretto the Redeemer is shown engaged in silent dialogue with his mother.The spears of the soldiers watching the spectacle on the other side of the hill of Golgotha give the place a spiky and inhospitable appearance. They suggest the mythical warriors that sprang from the seed of the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus, only to turn and slaughter each other at once. Tintoretto may have been deliberately conjuring up Counter-Reformation ideas of the disunity of the enemies of Christ, since the garment of Christ, the symbol of church unity, is placed antithetically in front of the Roman army banner

43386-virgin_c.jpg	While at Padua and even in Venice itself some of the main figures of the new art of Tuscany were working to the laws of perspective and in the conviction of the conscious dignity of man as an individual, Venetian painting reacted to the promptings of the new culture almost with reluctance, filtering them through a vision which in substance was still Gothic. This is the context of the work of Antonio Vivarini and Jacopo Bellini, both founders of dynasties of artists, and both crucial figures in the period of transition in Venice from the first to the second half of the fifteenth century. This 'Madonna and Child' belongs to Antonio Vivarini's earliest period and is characterized by a certain plasticity of shape and form arising out of the gentle throbbing of the chiaroscuro and the luminous timbre of the colour

03760-027pieta.jpg	"One of the artist's most complete and programmatical figurative works. On the parapet on which Christ is held by the Madonna and St. John is the inscription: HAEC FERE QUUM GEMITUS TURGENTIA LUMINA PROMANT: BELLINI POTERAT FLERE IOANNIS OPUS (When these swelling eyes evoke groans, this work of Giovanni Bellini could shed tears). This is a fragment of a hymn from the first book of Propertius's ""Elegies"", whose presence at the base of the painting affirms the artist's religious education.The Piet&#224; is rightly considered one of the most moving paintings in the history of art. Deep feeling is expressed throughout, from the landscape that recalls Flemish antecedents to the lucid architectonic composition of the group and the abstract geometry of their movements, deriving from Piero della Francesca. A passionate feeling that is not so much religious as human and psychological pervades the actors in the drama. The rendering of grief has here its most universal expression and, at the same time, its most private and conscious dimension. The mother's pathetic gesture is reflected in St John's turning away. The construction of the work shows careful thought. The figures, borrowed from popular imagery, are grouped in the foreground against an infinite horizon. The pentagonal arm of Christ ending in a closed fist is that of a fallen but un vanquished athlete. The barely glimpsed landscape, with its road wandering up a height and its torrent coursing below, pulsates with earthly life.The figures stand out against a leaden dreamlike sky. The painting retains a strong Paduan element that is evident in the contours, adjusting gestures and figures to the strong expressive requirements of the drama. The silent exchange of emotions in the faces is reflected in the masterly play of the hands. The landscape behind them, empty and metallic in the cold, shining greys of the painful dawn of rebirth, accentuates the sense of the scene's anguish. Both the Donatello of the altar of St Anthony of Padua and, once again, Mantegna and the Flemish masters are the influences which spurred Bellini along the path of a sad and bitter pathos"

06554-fishmark.jpg	Brueghel's Great Fish-Market, dating from the year 1603, contains many elements of Mannerist landscape painting. Rendered in a perspective that is almost a bird's-eye-view, the scene opens up across a downward-sloping foreground teeming with hundreds of figures grouped around the stalls and booths of a fishmarket. The eye is drawn towards the harbour in the background, out across the bay and along the coastline, past entire towns with ruins, piers and fortresses, into the depths of the mountains, whose blue merges with the sea.What we see here is a universal landscape, but one broken down into individual themes that are soon to establish themselves as genres in their own right. Fish-market scenes of this kind were to become an independent subject in Flemish painting, for example in the works of Snyder. Still life paintings of fish, such as that displayed for sale here, would also begin to emerge. Marine painting, ruins, and even pure landscape are all to be found as elements in this painting. We even seem to be able to make out a family portrait: the group at the centre of the foreground is thought to be a self portrait of the painter in the company of his family

00843-09_coron.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 9 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The glory of St Mary, a theme dear to Angelico is acclaimed by six kneeling saints. The saints represented on the lower part are (from the left) St Thomas, St Benedict, St Dominic, St Francis, St Peter the Martyr and St Mark. The fresco probably belongs to the first ones executed in the Convent by Fra Angelico.These six saints can be seen as a token representation of the elect, who surround Christ and the Virgin in heaven in the traditional rendering of this scene. But like so many other figures in the series of San Marco frescoes, they have an air of detachment from the events to which they are nominally witnesses. They hold their hands out in adoration and gaze heavenwards, but none looks directly at the scene of coronation. The Virgin, with her arms folded over her chest, leans forward to receive the crown. She is seated beside Christ, in accordance with the usual composition for this subject.In this series of frescoes at San Marco Angelico has not turned back to medieval prototypes but instead, through economy in the use of figures, restraint in the overt expression of emotion, and austere use of colour, he has created his own meditative images of remarkable force

20706-eucharis.jpg	The most important and most perfect work of Joos van Wassenhove (Justus of Ghent) by far is The Institution of the Eucharist (The Communion of the Apostles), painted for the high altar of the Brotherhood of Corpus Domini. The picture was based on a painting by Fra Angelico that Justus may have seen at St Mark's convent in Florence, in which the disciples leave the table to kneel at Christ's feet. Yet, despite this influence, the finished work shows just how far Justus's style remained purely Flemish, virtually untouched by all he had seen during his time in Italy.The scene is set in the chancel of a church built on the Latin plan, its apse supported by a row of composite columns. On each side of the painting is an opening through which distant houses and towers are visible. These panoramic views are reminiscent of Ghent or of Bruges. Christ is seen standing three-quarters on to the viewer, in front of the table. He holds the paten in his left hand, as he offers the consecrated bread to St James the Less. Around him, those disciples who have received the host appear happy and at peace, while the faces of the others express their eagerness to partake of it too. The unfortunate figure of Judas stands to one side in the shadow, as if trying to avoid Christ's gaze. In the foreground stand a plate and pitcher that will later be used to wash the disciples' feet.In the background, to the right, is a lively group made up of Duke Federico, two of his courtiers and Caterino Zeno, the ambassador of the Shah of Persia. The presence of this latter figure seems designed to indicate that the Holy Eucharist is a universal sacrament and that Christ has become incarnate in order to save all men, whatever their origins. Just behind this group a young woman can be made out, carrying the young Guidobaldo in her arms. Two angels hover above the protagonists, held in perfect balance by their tensile wings. One of them is praying, while the other simply expresses his emotion as a witness to the sacred event below.There is a remarkable contrast between the group of the apostles, on the one hand, and that of the Duke and his followers, on the other. Justus demonstrates his great talent as a portraitist in the means he finds to express both the ardent faith of the former and the noisy activity of the latter, highlighting their facial expressions by the movement of their hands. He also plays on the contrasts between the simple, even poor clothes of the apostles, and the rich and luxurious apparel of the Duke and his companions. As for Christ, he is shown wearing a grey-blue robe. His disciples are in tunics of various colours - green, light red, yellow and brown. They have fair hair, save for one who is dark, and Judas, who has red hair. This admirable counterpoint of colours is complemented by the greeny blue of the wings of the two angels, that stands out against the dark brown of the apse. It is rare to find a painting from that period that so felicitously combines the demands of both spiritual feeling and realism

21029-virgin2.jpg	This painting and its companion piece, Virgin Mary, were probably intended to be shown at either side of a representation of the crucified Christ, a hypothesis supported by St John's gaze. Since the Virgin and the Apostle have been portrayed as sculptures in a niche, in an architectural setting, the absent Christ would probably have been a statue. Unfortunately, the effect the sculpture would have had in the niche is offset by the extravagant frame.Apart from creating the illusion of figures in a niche - St John's toes extend over the pedestal, and the emphatic shadows draw the figure out of the background - the depiction is remarkable in another way, too. St John is usually shown clean-shaven - here he has a moustache and goatee beard. Perhaps this is a portrait of a sitter in the role of the Apostle. It is noticeable that his face has more individual characteristics than the Virgin's

31511-sigismun.jpg	The artist depicted Sigismund of Luxembourg (1387-1437), King of Hungary and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, full face, turned slightly away from the plane of the picture. The king wears a brocade garment edged with fur, and on his head there is his characteristic fur hat with ear-flaps. His wavy hair and beard are grey, his aquiline nose is long, his lips half opened. He looks somewhat upwards into the distance, his eyes are blue, as is the background. Whoever the artist was, Pisanello or somebody else, he created a picture in which the most delicate nuances have been achieved by the means of graphic art.At first glance the face appears to be extraordinarily lively, but if we observe it more thoroughly we cannot but notice that it shows a certain heraldic rigidity. This may be due to the hard evenness of the eyes, the improbable regularity of the teeth, which look like a row of pearls, to the sharp contours of the cherry-red lips or the hair and beard, the hairs of which are drawn with separate lines. But all this does not point to the painter's clumsiness. These are, on the one hand, the stylistic marks of the International Gothic style, with its fondness for decorativeness, which one has to recognize, and, on the other, the endeavour to record the ideal type of a ruler, generally valid and easy to remember, and not only the individual, incidental features of Sigismund.A certain regularity is characteristic of the whole composition, which nearly touches the frame on all sides. On all four sides the face and the neck are encircled by soft, brown fur, identical in colour and texture. The slight asymmetry caused by the turn of the head is counterbalanced by the pattern, more thickly drawn than the rest, on Sigismund's garment, a bit left from the centre

23380-04febo1.jpg	The portraits of Laura da Pola and Febo da Brescia belong to the period in his career when Lotto was particularly active as a portraitist. Both paintings are signed and dated 1544. They were identified by Berenson as works of Lotto from the artist's account book.Rather than painting monarchs and prelates, as did Titian, Lotto portrayed the local nobility, fixing their traits with an acute eye. There is no rhetorical decorative detail but only the existential truth of the subject.The sitters' families, originally from Brescia and Pola, respectively, had settled in Treviso in the fourteenth century, and by the early fifteenth were counted among the wealthiest in the city. Febo Bettignoli da Bressa was born in 1524 and died violently in 1547, perhaps in battle. Lauara da Pola, much younger than her husband, was born in 1524 and died in 1596. In the portraits Lotto endows the Trevigian couple with markedly aristocratic air. He adopted a format and approach close to those customarily employed by Titian for his own high-ranking sitters: vertical field; planar poses; relatively neutral background; restriction of the accessories to a few

07239-canal608.jpg	The gilded bronze horses of San Marco are one of the great treasures of Venice. They are thought to be ancient, although their precise origin and date remains a matter of scholarly debate. It appears they were taken from Constantinople when the city was sacked by the Venetians in 1204.In the 1740s the horses were above the loggia at the entrance to San Marco. They were only removed from this position in 1798 when Napoleon's troops overtook the city and were then taken to Paris, but returned to Venice in 1815.The dramatic arrangement of these horses on pedestals is entirely fictional. It is possible that it is intended to convey the frustration felt by many at not being able to study the horses properly above the loggia. For example, the Neo-classical sculptor, Antonio Canova (1757-1822), suggested that they should be set either side of the entrance to the Doge's palace so that they could be seen to better advantage

23181-19monaco.jpg	Piero di Giovanni became 'Lorenzo Monaco' (Lorenzo the Monk) upon taking his vows in 1391 at the Camaldolese monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence. This ascetic order had been founded in 1012 by a Benedictine monk, Saint Romuald, shocked at the decadent laxity of his own monastery, and named by him after the mountain locality of Camaldoli in Tuscany where he built a hermitage. Legend has it that he dreamed of a ladder stretching from earth to Heaven, on which men in white robes were ascending, and thereupon decreed that the monks of his new order would dress in white. For this reason, Camaldolese altarpieces such as this one always show Saint Benedict, the sixth-century founder of the Benedictines, dressed in white rather than Benedictine black.Benedict is shown here on the extreme left, his book inscribed with the opening words of the Prologue of his Rule, which the Camaldolites as reformed Benedictines observed. In his left hand is the birch he used to chastise errant monks. At his side sit Saint John the Baptist and Saint Matthew with his Gospel. Equally venerable on the extreme right is Saint Romuald in his white habit, with no lesser personages than Saint Peter and Saint John the Evangelist beside him. These and other saints are witnessing the Coronation by Christ of the Virgin after her Assumption to Heaven, a scene first depicted in thirteenth-century France and at this period extremely popular in Florence, although it is not mentioned in the Gospels. Since the Virgin sometimes personifies the Church, Christ vesting her with a regal crown confirms the authority of Church and Pope, a suitable subject in this city politically allied with the Papacy. Angels make music below.In its original form the altarpiece was not divided as a triptych but presented a single surface with a three-arched top, with gables and a predella. The main panel was divided into three parts sometime after 1792 and the side pieces and central scene entered the National Gallery at different times. They are now shown in a modern frame.Viewing this attractive work in its present state and location, it is easy to forget its solemn liturgical function and institutional self-promotion - the way the founding saints of the Benedictine and Camaldolese orders are installed in Heaven on equal terms with Evangelists, apostles and the Baptist. It is even harder to remember that the artist who painted these calligraphic lines, delicious colour combinations - the Virgin's robe has faded from its original pinkish mauve - and courtly mannered angels was himself a member of that austere, white-clad community

34216-landscap.jpg	Under the influence of the Roman, Ribera experimented briefly with a new type of painting, the landscape. The Landscape with Shepherds is a splendid example of his landscapes. Ribera often included simple if evocative vistas in his backgrounds, which consist of little but distant mountains under a limpid, blue sky streaked with cirrus clouds. In these extensive landscapes of 1639, he creates compositions of a powerful simplicity and compelling atmosphere which imply a knowledge of landscape painting in Rome. Ribera does not truly imitate Claude and his followers, but rather applies their warm effects of light to the sterner, architectonic compositions of the Bolognese practitioners, such as Carracci and Domenichino. This synthesis is new and original, and provided the initial inspiration to Salvator Rosa, who was then just starting his career in Naples.

15721-polyptic.jpg	Originally from the Scuola del Cristo at the Giudecca, the polyptych is composed of five panels, the central one of which is of St James the Greater with St John the Evangelist and St Filippo Benizzi (one of the saints of the Order of Servites) on the left, and St. Michael the Archangel and St. Louis of Toulouse on the right. The figures of the saints are set in a slow, semicircular rhythm against the tooled gold of the background and the actual paint seems to be translucent like porcelain. The extremely refined figures suggest obvious affinities with the world of Pisanello, particularly the figure of the Archangel Michael in his heavy armour decorated with gold, his pale face encircled with a crown of curls, his body poised almost as if to execute a dance-step over that of the dragon which lies like a heraldic image at the bottom of the panel.Again in this late work Giambono's confidence in his world of fabled lands and airy architecture, of gently flowing arabesques and elegantly shaded colourings will certainly not have been shaken by the presence in Venice since 1442 of an example of the new art emerging from Tuscany the frescoes of Andrea del Castagno in the chapel of St. Tarasius in the Church of San Zaccaria.The polyptych is signed in the lower part of the central panel: MICHAEL / GIAMBONO PINXIT

05458-1madonna.jpg	The so-called Raczynski Tondo was named after the private collection of which it was part before being acquired at the end of the 19th century by the Berlin Gem&#228;ldegalerie. It is possible that this is the painting that Vasari said hung in the church of San Francesco (now San Salvatore al Monte). There is a strict symmetrical structure to the composition with its life- size figures, and the finely toned down colours are very charming.Surrounded by eight wingless angels, Mary is breastfeeding her Child. There is direct eye contact with the observer, involving him in the intimate scene. The angels are holding lilies, the sign of Mary's purity, and are engaged in antiphonal singing: while some of them are calmly waiting to start, the others are singing and reverently looking at a hymn book.

15595-11pala1.jpg	Ghirlandaio's greatest achievement was the decoration of mainly private chapels with monumental frescoes. The furnishings of a chapel also included an altarpiece, and normally this would consist of an altar painting. The altarpieces normally found in Gothic art, consisting of several individual panels, with images painted on a gold background, had largely disappeared by Ghirlandaio's time. A new type of altarpiece had become common: the square panel.In the Tornabuoni Chapel of the Santa Maria Novella, Ghirlandaio made sure that the painted furnishings were complete. Part of the entire extent of the Tornabuoni commission included a panel painting for the main altar in the church of Santa Maria Novella - the Pala Tornabuoni - and its rear panel facing the apsidal chapel. The ensemble was dismembered in 1816, the main altar painting, which depicts the most important saints for this place, is now on show in Munich. From the six wings of the front side - mentioned by Vasari - supposedly two are in Munich, one in Budapest and one in Paris. The rear panel, the Resurrection of Christ is now in Berlin. Both works were begun during the last years of Ghirlandaio's life and were probably not completed until after he had died. There has been much debate as to which parts were painted by Ghirlandaio himself, and which by his workshop.In the central panel of the Pala Tornabuoni, shown here, Mary, the main patron saint of the church, is floating in glory with her child, surrounded by angels and above St Dominic, to whose order the monks of Santa Maria Novella belonged. Holding a book, St Dominic is kneeling in front of Archangel Michael. On the right, St John the Baptist is standing in front of the kneeling St John the Evangelist.

33404-05passio.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 557.Rembrandt received a commission from the court in about 1628 through Constantijn Huygens, secretary to the Prince of Orange, for five paintings of the Passion of Christ. The series started with the Raising of the Cross and Descent from the Cross. He was hired to create small versions of Rubens famous altarpieces in Antwerp, the Raising of the Cross and the Descent from the Cross. Huygens asked Rembrandt to produce paintings less than one-twenty-fifth the size of the Rubenses. It must also have been agreed between Huygens and Rembrandt that the artist would inset himself into the composition of the Descent from the Cross as one of the followers of Christ who eased the body to the ground.The two paintings, finished in 1633 are plainly modelled on Rubens's versions of those subjects. When they were delivered in 1633, a new commission followed, for three more paintings of scenes from the Passion of Christ, The Entombment, The Resurrection and The Ascension. The first to be delivered, early in 1636, was The Ascension, the last in iconographic order. If in the Raising and Descent Rembrandt had vied with Rubens, in the Ascension he had moved back in time to the Venetian master Titian. In a composition based on one of Titian's most famous works, the Assumption of the Virgin in the Church of Frari in Venice, Rembrandt created an image of earth, sky, and heaven, with mortals taking leave of a divine creature being raised by angels to the Godhead itself.The reception of the Ascension was not enthusiastic and did not lead to new commissions from The Hague. The final two pieces from the commission of 1633, The Entombment and The Resurrection, were completed in 1639. The series was finally completed only in 1646, with a commission for two other canvases with scenes from the life of Christ as an infant, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Circumcision (now lost, it is known from a copy in the Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Braunschweig)

05531-40venusm.jpg	The painting of Venus and Mars deals with an amorous victory. A grove of myrtle trees, the tree of Venus, forms the backdrop to the two gods who are lying opposite each other on a meadow. Venus is clothed and is attentively keeping watch over Mars as he sleeps. The god of war has taken off his armor and is lying naked on his red cloak; all he is wearing is a white loin cloth.The goddess of love, who is clothed in a costly gown, is watching over the sleeping naked Mars, while little fauns are playing mischievously with the weapons and armor of the god of war. Botticelli's theme is that the power of love can defeat the warriors strength. The boisterous little fauns that form part of the retinue of Bacchus, the god of wine, are depicted by Botticelli, in accordance with ancient tradition, with little goats' legs, horns and tails. The Triton's shell with which one of the fauns is blowing into Mars' ear was used in classical times as a hunting horn.Botticelli let himself be inspired by classical models. The mischievous little satyrs playing practical jokes nearby were probably suggested by a description of the famous classical painting Wedding of Alexander the Great to the Persian princess Roxane, written by the Greek poet Lucian. Botticelli replaced the amoretti which Lucian describes playing with Alexander's weapons with little satyrs. His painting is one of the earliest examples in Renaissance painting to depict these boisterous and lusty hybrids in this form. They are playing with the war god's helmet, lance and cuirass. One of them is cheekily blowing into his ear through a sea shell. But he has as little chance of disturbing the sleeping god as the wasps nest to the right of his head. The wasps may be a reference to the clients who commissioned the painting. They are part of the coat of arms of the Vespucci family, whose name derives from vespa, Italian for wasp. Given that its theme is love, this painting was possibly also commissioned on the occasion of a wedding

18205-0210grec.jpg	El Greco painted several pictures of The Purification of the Temple. The subject, which evidently held a deep fascination for El Greco, accompanied the artist throughout his career: he painted some versions in Italy (possibly even in Venice) and several more dating from the 1590s onwards - in Spain. Many more was painted in his studio. The catalogue raisonn� of El Greco's works lists four as autograph and eight as studio pictures or copies.This is the earliest known version of this subject by El Greco. It has usually been dated to El Greco's Venetian years, although some scholars have placed it to his time in Rome. The artist borrowed extensively from High Renaissance visual models (among others from Michelangelo, Titian, Veronese and Tintoretto) and did very little to disguise them. Uncertainties in the handling of anatomy and space can be observed which confirm the early date of the painting

33552-081portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 265.The most striking characteristic of this portrait is the sitter's luxuriant blond hair. He also has an almost white moustache, beard and eyebrows, which, but for the fact that he has dark rather than pale pink eyes, might suggest that he was an albino.The sitter was recently identified as probably Pieter Six (1612-1680), the elder brother of Jan Six, on the basis of a comparison with a drawing supposed to be of Pieter Six in the Six family collection. The identification of the sitter as Pieter Six is further borne out by the sitter's apparent age. The portrait can be dated on stylistic grounds to about 1650, when Six was just under forty.The Sixes were rich Amsterdam merchants, and Rembrandt had close contacts with Jan from 1645 to 1654, so he must have known the family well.

30841-saints1.jpg	This painting was part of a series of eight panels painted for an altar complex in the church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. The altarpiece had the form of a Roman triumphal arch, with large scenes flanked by Perugino's standing saints, which are notable for the subdued colouring and subtle treatment of light. The commission for the altarpiece was originally given to Filippino Lippi, and then was passed to Perugino, who finished the work in November of 1507. The altar was definitively dismantled and dispersed in 1654.All of the painted panels survive, though those of individual standing saints have been cropped to varying degrees at the top and bottom. The Deposition (probably from the front side of the altarpiece) is in the Galleria dell'Accademia, Florence; an Assumption of the Virgin (probably from the reverse side) is in a side chapel of the SS. Annunziata, Florence; a pair of panels, St Margaret of Antioch and the Blessed Francis of Siena are in the Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg; and two more saints, cut down to half-length, Catherine of Alexandria and Filippo Benizzi are in a private collection and the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome, respectively; another pair, St John the Baptist and St Lucy are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.There are several hypothetical reconstructions of the altarpiece which almost certainly consisted of only these eight paintings

10529-virgin_c.jpg	Crivelli was one of the busiest painters in Venice during the second half of the fifteenth century and was responsible for many altarpieces in small churches in Veneto and in the Marches. Adapting himself to the conservative taste of his patrons, he painted in an archaic style based on Gothic tradition; his Madonnas are usually frontally posed and seen against a gold background of Byzantine splendour. There is but little movement and few details from nature, the composition being solemn and strictly linear. Only the pure and sure design of the faces and the lavishly applied festoons of flowers and fruits testify to Crivelli's being a master of the fifteenth century, a Renaissance artist with a style of his own.The Virgin and Child Enthroned was formerly the central panel of a polyptych in the church of San Domenico at Ascoli Piceno. The representation of saints from the wings are in the National Gallery in London.The painting is signed on the step of the throne: OPUS CAROLI CRIVELLI VENETI

14443-209fried.jpg	Caspar David Friedrich, protagonist of German Romantic art and one of the greatest of European landscapists, painted his famous Wanderer above the Mists in c. 1818. It embodies the quintessence of the principles of the Romantic landscape aesthetic, showing a lonely figure confronting nature in astonished reverence. In the foreground we see the dark silhouette of a rocky promontory, where a wayfarer stands looking out over dense fog and spires of rock in the valley towards distant mountains and peaks. High above these stretches a bank of clouds. The scenic excerpt is dominated by the deep space of a vista, prompting us to wonder what lies beyond. Friedrich's figures who habitually turn their backs to gaze into the horizon or stare from windows with rapt attention are images of the artist. His Wanderer, frock-coated and stick in hand, has climbed to a rocky peak above swirling mountain mists; the viewer looks with his eyes, the angle of vision being exactly aligned to their level in the picture space. The foreground, the conventional plateau to give the viewer a fix on the subject, has been entirely dispensed with.

The central panel was this Madonna currently in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, other panels are in the in the Mus�e Jacquemart-Andr�, Chaalis and in the Museo Horne, Florence.While Duccio - with his reliance on Byzantine traditions, flat planes, and decorative line - can be said to sum up the past, Giotto was recognized even by his contemporaries as anticipating the future. Dante, Boccaccio, and Petrarch all praised his naturalism. Giotto's panel, probably the central section of a five-part altarpiece, was painted late in his career. The colours are sober and restrained. Soft shadows model the Virgin and child. We sense the weight and volume of their bodies and feel the pull of gravity on them.We also sense that they are actors in a quiet drama. We are witnesses to the human interaction between a mother  and a child. The infant steadies himself by grasping his mother's finger and reaches - like any baby - for the flower she holds. This emphasis on the humanity of the participants is a departure from the devotional Byzantine tradition, as in the Gallery's Enthroned Madonna and Child, in which the infant Christ does not turn to his mother, but rather offers a blessing to the worshiper

17243-auvers03.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 820, JH 2010.Blossoming spring branches symbolise the rebirth of nature, or hope and redemption in a wider sense. Van Gogh used this motif in a similar sense, referring mostly to events in his own life. On 16 May, 1890 he left the asylum by his own will and left Saint-R�my. When he arrived in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he was greeted by rampant vegetation. He had spent early spring down in the South, in Provence, but the North unexpectedly surprised him with a second spring, the inspiring effect of which can be seen in his choice of subject.In Auvers, van Gogh painted the old chestnut trees on the street with white and pink flowers about to drop their petals, whereas in the present painting he depicted the blossoming chestnut branches as a still-life, in a jug together with rhododendrons. The unorthodox cutting of the picture and the asymmetrical composition reflect the influence of Japanese prints as in van Gogh's works of similar subjects

22646-09annunc.jpg	"Fra Filippo devoted a surprising number of pictures to the Annunciation, of which the most significant example is perhaps the one in the National Gallery in London, although others can be found in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, the Uffizi in Florence, the Galleria Nazionale in Rome, and the National Gallery in Washington. The artist's fondness for the theme almost certainly derives from the interest aroused in it by the Dominican priest Antonino Pierozzi, Archbishop of Florence in 1446 (died in 1459), and famous for the sermons he gave in the cathedral and which are collected in the 'Summa theologica.' Outstanding among these were the long dissertations, with which Lippi was undoubtedly familiar, on the subject of the Annunciation.It is very likely that this picture was painted in just those years, between 1445 and 1450.The metaphor of light as a metaphysical vehicle, the allegorical significance of the heavenly communication that touches the Virgin on the shoulder, 'super brachium,' and is impressed like a seal, 'ut signaculum,' strongly stimulated the imagination of the painter, who was faced, like so many artists before and after him, with the insoluble problem of how to depict the conception of the Mother of God: ""The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee"" (Luke, 1, 35).In this picture, in which the architectural framework may be the work of an assistant, the artist has painted the hands of God at the top, emerging from the clouds and releasing the dove of the Holy Ghost.

07614-66annunc.jpg	Caravaggio painted church paintings during his last period in Naples. There is reason to believe that the artist's last altarpiece is the Annunciation that reached the high altar of the cathedral of Nancy in Lorrain just after the church was founded (1609). Today it is in the museum of that city.Whether the painting was made in Sicily or in Naples is not known.  Its style would seem to exclude earlier datings, for it is clearly a very late work. It has been pointed out that the angel comes into the painting from real space, canceling the separation between the picture and the viewer in a way typical of the baroque aesthetic. The angel's face is practically invisible. The Virgin does not look at him, she is completely self-absorbed, her pose is devoid of joyous acceptance. She seems instead crushed by the expectation of an unbearable future. The spiritual testament that Caravaggio left us with this large, two-figural painting, where once again the Virgin is not distinguished by deifying attributes, is an infinite existential sadness, which seems to contain no hope of redemption

10462-hecuba.jpg	Bolognese painter Giuseppe Maria Crespi, also surnamed lo Spagnolo, was heir to various artistic traditions. Trained in his youth in the rich Bolognese heritage of the Carracci as well as the Venetian school, he later drew artistic inspiration from north of the Alps, in particular in his commissions in Florence for Prince Ferdinand of Tuscany. Crespi's oeuvre plays on several registers. He is known on the one hand for his folk-style genre scenes, the intimacy of which frequently carries over into his religious works, full of tenderness and domestic details. At the same time, when depicting religious, antique or mythological themes, he is not afraid to produce works of a much more monumental and dramatic character, at times even with a decidedly tragic slant, as is the case here.The theme is probably taken from Hecuba, a tragedy by the antique Greek author Euripides. During the Trojan war Hecuba had sent her youngest son, together with a large fortune, to safety with Polymnestor, her son-in-law and King of Thrace. Polymnestor, however, abused Hecuba's trust in a dreadful manner, murdering and bespoiling the defenceless child he was supposed to protect. Crespi's painting depicts Hecuba's revenge for this foul deed.To the left Polymnestor is held fast by a Trojan woman. To the right Hecuba rushes up to him and puts out her son-in-law's eyes. The painter has masterfully succeeded in converting the dramatic release of the mother's wrath on the murderer of her descendant into a powerful picture that leaves a lasting impression. The pictures rise up out of the dark background in a very mellow and nervous style of painting, a combination that had earlier proven its expressive accuracy in the late works of Titian and Caravaggio. Polymnestor, flailing helplessly in the air, has no recourse against Hecuba, who in her fluttering garments wreaks out just punishment with the elegance and precision of an angel of wrath, whilst her companion resolutely turns her head away from the dreadful jjudgment. By depicting Hecuba entirely from behind, in foreground, the painter also enables the viewer to identify to a certain degree with the mother as the executor of a just punishment

32260-12rinald.jpg	"The theme is taken from Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata (""Jerusalem Delivered""), which describes a battle between the Christians and the Muslims during the siege of Jerusalem at the end of the First Crusade. Poussin selects an episode in which the Christian knight Rinaldo has landed on the island of the seductive enchantress Armida; having bewitched him with her singing, Armida is on the point of stabbing the sleeping crusader with a dagger when love stays her hand, and she decides instead to carry him off to her enchanted palace.Poussin portrays the moment in which the still sleeping Rinaldo, defenceless, stripped of his weapons and bound with garlands of flowers, is abducted by Armida with the aid of a band of putti, while the companions who had first persuaded the knight to land on the island wait beside a column in the background.George Frideric Handel composed an opera using a libretto written by Giacomo Rossi, based on episodes of Gerusalemme liberata."

In both, the artist is shown intent on his craft, palette in hand, with a sideways glance. In tenor, however, the later work demonstrates the self-confidence of an artist who had just held a one-man exhibition in a prime Parisian gallery, which in critical terms he had deemed a success; who had the support of the most vanguard Parisian writers; and who had begun to write Noa Noa which he intended as a work to 'facilitate the understanding' of his most recent Tahitian paintings.The work is dedicated to the poet Charles Morice (1860-1919), who collaborated with Gauguin on the writing of Noa Noa in 1893-95, which would mean that the work dates from his period in Paris, although it is taken directly from a photograph of 1888

25294-112sketc.jpg	It was as a master of fresco-painting and as a most prolific decorator of churches and palaces in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary that Franz Anton Maulbertsch was most appreciated by his contemporaries. Perhaps nowadays greater value is placed on his surviving bozzetti - sketches painted in gloriously fresh colours with brilliant technique.His late works, such as The Holy Trinity, a sketch for an altar-piece, are fluid in their handling, and the light colours give a silvery effect. In these sketches Maulbertsch captured his subjects with a few unbelievably light strokes of the brush and some spots of colour permeated with light. When he elaborated these sketches in their final form, however, particularly in the case of the later altarpieces, the spontaneity was often lost, the forms becoming heavier and the hues muted.This sketch from the late period of the artist was identified as a study for the altarpiece in the Parish Church in Wien-Reindorf

37510-1deposit.jpg	The apparent rivalry between Sodoma and Beccafumi, already suggested in their work in the Oratory of San Bernardino and their paintings of Saint Catherine, is evident in a number of innovative altarpieces produced by the two painters for the Siena's principal churches. Although both painters were commissioned to execute altarpieces that represented the theme of the Virgin and Christ Child enthroned with saints, they also produced a series of narrative altarpieces which pushed beyond the conventional boundaries for the representation of these subjects.The earliest of these works was Sodoma's monumental altarpiece of the Deposition of Christ. Still within its blue and gold wooden frame and with its predella, this painting is now housed within Siena's Pinacoteca and is therefore divorced from the surroundings for which it was designed. From descriptions of the altarpiece in the sixteenth-century, it seems that it was commissioned for the altar of the Cinuzzi family in the church of San Francesco, and the family's coat-of-arms accordingly appears at either end of the predella. Sodoma's altarpiece thus once stood over the fifth altar along the south wall of this barn-like mendicant church. By virtue of its imposing size, its bright and luminous colours and its clear, expressive figurative composition, the altarpiece would undoubtedly have been a striking sight in its setting

26013-07noseba.jpg	Born at Seligenstadt near the German city of Frankfurt, Hans Memling became a citizen of Bruges in 1465, of which he was one of the best known painters until his death in 1494. The Martyrdom of St Sebastian, the style and technique of which are typical of this artist, has long been attributed to him. It appears to have been painted around 1475.Sebastian, a young captain of the Praetorian guard, assisted Christians during Diocletian's persecutions at the end of the third century. Unmasked, he refused to abjure his faith and was handed over to archers on the Field of Mars in Rome. Left for dead, he survived thanks to the care of a widow called Irene. When subsequently he returned to the imperial palace to protest against the cruel treatment reserved for the Christians, he was again arrested and put to death in the Coliseum.In this high quality painting, Hans Memling concentrates on Sebastian's first confrontation with his executioners. The action takes place in a raised site, dominating a vast landscape of a port city surrounded by a medieval wall. To the right one archer has just shot his arrow, whilst the second is stretching his bow. Behind them, half hidden between two rocks, Emperor Diocletian is giving the order to execute the sentence. To the left Sebastian, chest bared, is attached to a tree, his shirt and rich brocade mantle cast at his feet. Five arrows pierce him. Despite his martyrdom, no sign of suffering marks the saint's features. This sign of the triumph of faith is typical of Memling, looking for suavity of forms. Added to this, his fine sense of detail and rendering of materials, particularly well represented by the magnificent brocade of the mantle in the foreground, place him among the great Flemish painters of the 15th century.The arrow being the symbol of the plague, Sebastian, who survived his martyrdom, became the protector par excellence against this sickness. The saint's pose, with the right arm along his body and his left arm attached to the tree above his head, can also be related to German engravings accompanying prayers against the plague. In addition, the arrows which pierce his four limbs and his side make reference to the five wounds of the crucified Christ

24479-st_anne.jpg	In Florence the new age of the Renaissance began in painting with a rather subdued work, devoid of any rhetoric: The Madonna and Child with Saint Anne executed by Masolino and Masaccio in 1424. The structure of this work is simple yet extraordinarily monumental. The succession of planes is compact and follows an upward direction, thus creating a pyramid shape. The composition can certainly attributed to Masaccio who executed only the Madonna and Child and the two angels (the upper right-hand one, and the one looking down from on high). A sense of grave dignity and power emanates from the faces, from the expressions and from the solidity of the bodies.Despite the presence of a strong chiaroscuro, the painting is bright due to the use of a dense colour paste which absorbs the light and so heightens the tones. The light comes very distinctly from the left, and the figure of the Madonna casts a light but very visible shadow on the floor. The base and the throne are drawn according to precise points of reference which produce the effect of perspective.This is a masterpiece of the youthful activity of Masaccio, already so innovative at such a young age

36763-baptism.jpg	Christ being baptised in the river Jordan by St John the Baptist. The Holy Ghost appears in the form of a radiant dove. For this painting Van Scorel drew on elements from works by Raphael and other Italian Renaissance artists. He had travelled in Italy.The picture is a superior example of the assimilation of the new Italian conception in Netherlandish painting. In it several motives, functionally quite distinct, are brought together, and they are brought together as they should be: within a clear, realistic space, and answering to aesthetic requirements developed in Renaissance art theory, such as grace and visual variety

08775-annuncia.jpg	Petrus Christus belonged to the same generation as Van der Weyden, but was perhaps a little younger. He came to Bruges from North Brabant, possibly after completing his initial training in Haarlem. His style is strongly modelled on that of Van Eyck and so there is good reason for suspecting he was Jan's apprentice, even though he did not purchase free citizenship of Bruges until three years after his putative master's death.The two panels by Christus, the Annunciation and the Nativity were quite badly worn, but painstakingly restored. Both of them are signed and dated (1452) and were probably painted as part of a triptych or polyptych. They reveal Christus as a precise designer of space and moulder of volumes. The figures in the Annunciation resemble statues arranged in a geometrically constructed show-case. It is the first painting in the Netherlands with a correct central perspective

21717-smokers.jpg	Not all the Le Nain genre scenes depict peasants. Some of them show middle-class sitters, even rarer in art than the depiction of the poor. It is one of these larger 'bourgeois compositions' which admits the Le Nain brothers into that small group of painters capable of creating a masterpiece. This is the Smokers in an Interior in the Louvre, dated 1643. Its technique must have been learned during the painting of the Forge, but the brushwork is far more precise. The composition is much less original, being closer to the type familiar from the Dutch. The figures are grouped round a table illuminated by a solitary candle, and the figure on the left has fallen asleep at the table.In this painting it seems that the depiction of low life - here middle-class men smoking in an interior - has risen beyond its normal pictorial limitations to create a masterpiece which is, perforce, unexpected. While Nicolas Poussin was obsessed with the concept of beauty and with the need to be able to paint exactly what he thought, here the painter's desire arises from an opposite need, the need to observe. Each of the models appears to be a portrait, although it is difficult to explain why the sitters should have chosen to be depicted with such casualness. There is no clue to the possibility of a confraternity, although the curious emblems on the carpet on the table could be symbols of some secret society. The eerie quality of the picture is emphasized by the fall of the shadows on the faces and by the way in which the figures stare into space just like the peasants in other pictures and the seated figure on the right has all the appearance of being under the influence of some drug.There is no satisfactory explanation for such a picture; it is as if this trio of painters, observers of a small fragment of their times, never intended the meanings of their pictures to be divined

24870-pratove1.jpg	The crowning achievement of the Master of Pratovecchio was an elaborate Gothic altarpiece painted for the Camaldolese nunnery of San Giovanni Evangelista at Pratovecchio. The triptych (now dismembered) had its centre the Assumption of the Virgin. The lateral panels (now in the National Gallery, London, in regilded and partly reconstructed frames) represents St Michael, and St John the Baptist, as well as a bishop saint (possibly St Donatus of Arezzo) and a female martyr (possibly Antilla). They are flanked by piers decorated on their front and outer surfaces with standing figures of saints. Above them are roundels with the angel and the Annunciate Virgin. At the top are the pinnacles representing the Virgin and St John the Evangelist. These two figures flanked a panel of the Crucifix, now lost.

38677-concert.jpg	Ter Borch's fame rests mainly upon the genre pictures he made after the middle of the 17th century which help define the subjects and pictorial schemes used by many artists of his generation and those who worked later. What sets him apart is his mastery of subtle narration which can charge every episode with subdued tension. Few genre painters ever revealed more delicately the character of three individuals and their relation to each other as they ostensibly go about their business of making music in a drawing-room.

And there 'came forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote...upon the plaster of the wall'.

02912-lastjudg.jpg	Jacob de Backer was a celebrated specialist of memorial paintings. According to one of his contemporaries, his heavy workload contributed to his own premature death at the age of 30. Antwerp's world-famous printer, Christopher Plantin ordered this painting from Jacob de Backer so that it could be installed in the Antwerp Cathedral as a memorial after his death. This was the custom at the time for leading citizens. We know therefore, that it must have been painted before 1589, the year in which Plantin died. The wings were added later, possibly by another artist in 1591.Christ appears above the clouds in a radiant light to sit in final judgment over humanity. Groups of saints sit among the clouds on either side of him. On the left we see the Virgin Mary and JOhn the Baptist, while Moses with his stone tablets appears on the right. The symbols of the Evangelists appear at Christ's feet, with three trumpet-playing angels below, and lower still, two angels who enact the sentence of the divine court. One drives the damned souls into hell with his sword, eagerly assisted by the demons that grab at the unfortunate condemned, while the other points the way to heaven. On the surface of the earth, other angels guide the blessed souls to paradise.Plantin is shown in the left wing, kneeling at a prie-dieu. He is accompanied by his young son, also called Christopher. The boy died young, as is indicated by the little red cross above his head. St Christopher, with the Infant Christ on his shoulders, stands by a wide river with a town on the opposite bank. The other wings shows Jeanne Rivi�re, Plantin's wife, praying with her six daughters - one of whom also died young. Her patron saint, John the Baptist, stands to the rear of the group.

A good example of this is the Adoration of the Magi, in which one can clearly see how Altichiero has combined the Giottesque character of the figures with the penchant for narrative detail that is more in tune with the taste of his own time. He does this by directing the attention of the viewer to the retinue of people from the Orient, to the humble appearance of the stable, and to the clothing, with its often contemporary, ultrafashionable cut and high-quality materials. Furthermore, in order to denote the specific locality, the painter allows the walls and towers of Bethlehem to rise beyond the mountains

23424-saragoss.jpg	Spanish painter of Romanticism. Long known as Eugenio Lucas y Padilla, research has shown that his real surname was Lucas Vel�zquez. He became a painter late in his career, still listing 'cabinetmaker' as his profession in 1844; by the mid-1850s he was well-established and finding success in his new career as painter. Lucas Vel�zquez was influenced by Goya, particularly in terms of colour and vigorous brushwork, and is considered a precursor to Impressionism. He may have also been influenced by Delacroix, whom he may have met in Paris, and he apparently knew, and perhaps influenced, Manet.Although he trained at the Madrid Academy, he was more or less self-taught and his work remained totally unacademic. Isolated from the general art scene, he concentrated in his early oeuvre on impressions of Spanish life. Padilla attracted public attention with dramatically agitated figure paintings. Largely scenes drawn from the revolution, the Inquisition, and bullfighting, these were in part copies, in part free reinterpretations of works by Goya and Vel�zquez.From June 1808 to 11 February 1809, the Spanish city of Saragossa under General Jose de Palafox y Melzi mounted heroic resistance to a siege by Napoleon's troops, surrendering only after over half of its inhabitants and defenders had fallen. Scenes from this bloody struggle were depicted in many pictures and leaflets of the day as well as in countless works later in the nineteenth century

10943-crucifix.jpg	"In this painting many of the figures hearken back to the most inventive masters (Jan van Eyck or Robert Campin) active long before. This is seen in such features as the oblique placement of the cross and the garb of the Roman soldiers, and from details like the lively dog digging up Adam's bones, at the right, buried at the base of the cross, his skull giving the site the name of Golgotha (""the place of the skull"")"			
35913-hagar.jpg	Hagar, the Egyptian hand maiden of Sarah was the mother of Ishmael, Abraham's first son. When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ishmael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water near by, so they were both saved. Two scenes, the banishment, and the appearance of the angel are common in 17th century Italian and Dutch painting

21757-caligula.jpg	"The artist was a pupil of Simon Vouet, but unlike his teacher he never left Paris. Le Sueur's style was based on Raphael and more immediately on Poussin. His best-known work is perhaps the series of paintings of the Life of Saint Bruno, dating from 1645-9 (Paris, Louvre). Although his style became increasingly classical, he retained a certain elegance in his draughtsmanship and use of colour.There has been some confusion over the exact title of this imposing painting: Nero depositing the Ashes of Germanicus and the Funeral of Poppaea have both been suggested in inscriptions or commentaries to various engravings after the picture. The earliest source, however, Florent Le Comte's Cabinet des singularitez d'architecture, peinture, sculpture et gravure (1699-1700), refers to the picture as Caligula depositing the Ashes of his Mother and Brother in the Tomb of his Ancestors. There is good reason to believe that this is the correct title since Le Comte claimed to be basing his statement on information recorded in a studio book kept by the artist and retained by the Le Sueur family. The painting, together with another entitled Lucius Albinus and the Vestal Virgins, was commissioned for Claude de Gu�n�gaud's residence in Paris in the rue Saint-Louis-au-Marais. Both are listed under the year 1647. The second painting is now lost, but it is recorded in a drawing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The classical source for the present painting is Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars:""Gaius [Caligula] strengthened his popularity by every possible means. He delivered a funeral speech in honour of Tiberius to a vast crowd, weeping profusely all the while; and gave him a magnificent burial. But as soon as this was over he sailed for Pandataria and the Pontian Islands to fetch back the remains of his mother and his brother Nero; and during rough weather, too, in proof of devotion. He approached the ashes with the utmost reverence and transferred them to the urns with his own hands. Equally dramatic was his gesture of raising a standard on the stern of the bireme which brought the urns to Ostia, and thence up the Tiber to Rome. He had arranged that the most distinguished knights available should carry them to the Mausoleum in two biers, at about noon, when the streets were at their busiest . . . "".Gaius Caesar, known as Caligula, the son of Germanicus and Agrippina, succeeded Tiberius as emperor in AD 37. Germanicus was the adopted son of Tiberius, who most probably had him poisoned owing to his growing popularity. The subject of Agrippina's return to Brundisium with the ashes of Germanicus was a popular theme with artists during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Tiberius eliminated several members of Germanicus' family, but promoted Gaius of whom he said, 'I am nursing a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the whole world.' The present subject is one that is rarely treated, whereas that of the companion painting, recounted by Livy and others, can be found in fifteenth-century Florentine art and also in the work of Le Sueur's contemporaries, Jacques Stella and Sebastien Bourdon. The theme that unites these two paintings might be said to be piety, both private in the actions of Caligula and public in the altruism of Lucius Albinus. Such demonstrations of moral virtue were often chosen as subjects for French paintings during the middle decades of the seventeenth century, in conjunction with the philosophical creed of Stoicism that Nicolas Poussin, amongst others, professed. The intellectual and physical severity of this creed is reflected in the style of the painting with its stilted composition, visual clarity, carefully demarcated spatial intervals and purity of colour, quite apart from the archaeological exactitude sought for the setting. It has been pointed out that the painting was executed during the period when Poussin's second set of the Seven Sacraments, painted for Fr�art de Chantelou, could be seen in Paris. The artist made a drawing of the high priest holding the urn (Private Collection, Paris)"

20588-scaldis.jpg	In addition to his favourite allegorical scenes, Abraham Janssens also painted religious and mythological themes. Janssens was slightly younger than Rubens, and for a time was his equal. After his visit to Italy, however, Rubens quickly surpassed him. Janssens painted Scaldis and Antwerpia for the State Room or 'Staetencamer' of Antwerp Town Hall. This decorative, allegorical work, commissioned by the city authorities, originally adorned the chimney breast, and consists of a paean of praise to the city's main artery, the River Scheldt.

37930-beanfest.jpg	In a seventeenth-century living-room, a cheerful company has assembled to enjoy the so-called 'Bean Feast on Twelfth Night' (the feast of the Epiphany, 6 January). In accordance with an old and widespread custom that still survives in many places, a bean was baked into a cake and the person who found it in their portion was given a paper crown and made king for the night, with the power to appoint companions to various positions, such as that of court jester. And whenever the king raised his glass, the others did the same, shouting out 'The king drinks!'In Jan Steen's picture, men, women and children form a cheerful crowd around the dining table, some in the fashionable middle-class dress of the day, while some are wearing different household utensils on their heads. Wearing the king's crown is a boy who stands on a small table, being helped to drain his glass by an elderly woman beside him. The jester, identified by the inscribed scrap of paper in his cap, is on his feet in front of the table, providing a rhythmical accompaniment with an earthenware pot and a small stick. On the far left, an older man with a metal funnel on his head has made a fiddle and bow from a ladle and a roasting spit, while someone else at the back is playing a real violin. On the opposite side, clearly keeping their distance, is a more genteel group gathered around a preacher and taking no part in the merriment.

31407-2doctor.jpg	The most unusual painting in the chapel is the one of Jesus disputing with the scribes in the Temple, commonly known as Christ among the Doctors. This event is reckoned among the seven sorrows of the Virgin, and for that reason it is clear that the selection of scenes for the chapel was based on the fact that she served as its patron.The debate takes place on a broad square in front of an imposing centric structure representing the Temple in Jerusalem, which is where the gospel of St Luke tells us the confrontation took place. The setting is reminiscent of Perugino's depiction of Christ surrendering the keys to Peter in the Sistine Chapel.Christ stands on the central axis of the composition, his books scattered on the pavement in front of him.

31963-05visita.jpg	The highly personal figurative inventions of Pontormo's Deposition in the Santa Felicit&#224; in Florence are also evident in his Visitation, dating to 1528-29. The lozenge-shaped arrangement of the four figures represented in the foreground of the painting was probably suggested to Pontormo by D�rer's engraving portraying the Four Witches (1497). Entirely original, on the other hand are the intertwining arcs of arms and fabric that firmly unites the two protagonists whose distinctly enlarged bodies dominate the painted surface.The monumental scene is depicted in a frozen fashion against the background of a roughly painted, funereally gloomy town. The profile portrayal of the two main figures embracing each other with extreme delicacy and exchanging looks of intense mutual affection is set against the rigidly frontal positions of the two bystanders in the background. Immobile, almost petrified, the latter keep their eyes fixed on something outside the scene, revealing their total lack of emotional participation in the event. The age difference between these two women and their facial resemblance with the protagonists invite an interpretation of the two maidservants as the doubles of Mary and Elisabeth. Their expressions convey a rather melancholic tone to the scene's general atmosphere of high spirituality

23521-descent1.jpg	Returning to Spain from Rome, where he lived for a time, Machuca produced exotic, hybrid paintings that place a higher value on expression than on correctness. His Deposition is thought to have been painted in the early 1520s, although on its original frame it is indicated that the altarpiece was ordered by Do&#241;a In�s de Castillo, and it was finished in 1547.In this picture the Italian veneer is starting to wear thin as the figures grow flatter, their anatomy more schematic than in his earlier paintings. At the same time, the facial expressions are more intense, as in the centre group, where St Mary Magdalene, waiting to receive Christ's body, and the man at the foot of the cross, who holds the corps, open their mouths wide, emitting almost audible sounds of grief. The group at the right is a jumble of strange types - a soldier in full armour, an old man in a tall fur hat with a conspicuous grimace on his face, a youth in short pants, standing self-consciously with a hand on his hip, a little boy wearing a kerchief around his head and tied beneath his chin, as if he had a toothache.

11704-8saints.jpg	The evolution of Domenico Veneziano's style after the Magnoli Altarpiece is evident in the Santa Croce fresco, Saints John the Baptist and Francis, the artist's last known painting. Originally in the Cavalcanti Chapel, next to the choir in the church of Santa Croce, the fresco was removed from the wall in 1566, when the choir was torn down as part of the modernization project directed by Vasari. In 1954, for the exhibition called Four Masters of the Early Renaissance, the two saints were detached once again and placed in the museum of Santa Croce, where they still are today.The two full-length figures are shown under a trompe l'oeil barrel vault; they are very similar, both in form and in the pale colour tones, to the figures of John and Francis in the Magnoli Altarpiece, except that they are much more solidly modelled and the drawing is stronger, elements that most art historians attribute to the influence of Castagno's painting. And Vasari had actually attributed the fresco to Andrea. This change in Domenico's later works can probably be interpreted as an attempt to incorporate all the more recent developments in Florentine painting, which was at the time moving towards the linearism of Filippo Lippi and Andrea del Castagno. The Santa Croce saints are therefore to be seen as an example of how the artist succeeded in interpreting the influence of contemporary art, further evidence of the consistency of his stylistic development

25226-stgregor.jpg	"This picture was originally painted for the Chapel of the Holy Cross in Karlstein castle, designated by Emperor Charles IV to house the imperial treasures, which included a large piece of the True Cross, the Holy Lance and the Holy Nail, and other holy relics of note. The gilt ceiling of the chapel was decorated with stars made out of gilded glass, representing Heaven, and with frescos. The walls were adorned with 133 panel paintings presenting a hierarchical ""host"" of saints. The impression of being not simply in front of a representation of Heaven, but of being in Heaven itself, was reinforced by the semi-precious stones studding the walls. 550 candles filled the dark chamber with light. Their flickering flames not only emphasized the glitter of the gilded decor but also made the colours sparkle. Within this chapel, so the emperor desired, the churches of Heaven and earth were to meet; it was to demonstrate both his imperial might and its divine legitimation.Master Theoderic, who played a major role in the decoration of the chapel, deliberately created the paintings as wall panels. In their restriction to head and hands, however, they also have something of an icon-like quality. They deliberately lack spatial depth. Their attributes, such as the book held by St Jerome in the present example, are disproportionately large. The saints portrayed were lent a potency above and beyond their artistic presence by the fact that each of their frames contained a relic associated with them"

37827-adoratio.jpg	Spranger was one of the leading representative of the Mannerist style. As used by art historians, Mannerism implies above all a sophisticated art, fully aware of all the techniques of naturalistic representation but more concerned with artifice than with fidelity to nature. Spranger was appointed court painter to the Emperor Rudolph II in Vienna, and in 1581 moved with the imperial capital to Prague. As Rudolph's art impresario, he designed the displays of the imperial collection - decorative objects, sculpture, prints - which were to influence artists throughout Northern Europe and the Iberian peninsula. Above all, he furnished erotic imagery to Rudolph's taste, silken titillation couched in mythological or allegorical guise.A less familiar aspect of Spranger's work is this altarpiece possibly commissioned by Rudolph and given by him to a prince-bishop of Bamberg for his private chapel. The subject allows Spranger to show off the fully international range of his talent. In the darkened stable we can just make out rustic Flemish shepherds; the dog in the foreground has found a tasty morsel; the kings proffer goldsmith's wares almost as elaborate, and just as detailed, as Pieter Bruegel's or Jan Gossaert's . These touches of Northern realism, however, are peripheral to the almost oppressive magniloquence of the main scene, more grandly Italianate than any Italian's. As their elder bends down to kiss the infant's foot, the two standing kings pose like ballet dancers in virtual mirror image of each other. All three are gorgeous in shot satins, acid harmonies of yellow highlights on red silk, blue shadows on pink. The red-haired king at the right is said to be an idealised self portrait of the artist. His regal bearing is echoed in the elaborate signature by the feet of the black king, which describes Spranger as born in Antwerp and painter to His Holy Majesty the Emperor

32943-04cardin.jpg	"The red cape and hat identify the figure as a cardinal, but his identity has remained unknown. It might be Cardinal Francesco Alidosi, whom the humanist Bembo described with the cutting words, ""Faith meant nothing to him, nor religion, nor trustworthiness, nor shame, and there was nothing in him that was holy.""This painting was once considered a work of the mature painter. But it has recently been dated 1510-1511 on the basis of its composition which resembles those of the Portraits of Agnolo and Maddalena Doni and the Mute Woman. The pose is identical: the figure is turned three-quarters out and the arm nearest the viewer defines the lower limit of the picture space. The Cardinal's right eye is particularly striking in its three-dimensional modelling, and its clear expression. The convex shape of the eyeball is clearly defined in its socket, the eyelid coming down at a slight angle over the moistly gleaming pupil. The sitter's gaze is so direct it is difficult to meet it. This unknown figure was probably one of the more important people in the papal court, for his portrait - with the same penetrating look - is to be found on the left-hand side of the Disputa in the Stanza della Segnatura"

17523-2adamev.jpg	Gossart's style, which blends Italian form with Flemish characteristics, also shows the influence of D�rer, whose engravings carried the classical canons of art across all of northern Europe.This painting is the earliest example in Gossart's oeuvre of the theme of Adam and Eve, a subject that preoccupied him over the course of his thirty-year career. It is closely based on D�rer's 1504 engraving of Adam and Eve, which presents the culmination of D�rer's nearly four-year study of these two figures. Gossart exchanged D�rer's dense forest backdrop and animal inhabitants for a clearing at the edge of the woods, with a small pond behind the figures and an open view to a meadow and hills beyoynd at the left. This landscape construction is generally characteristic of the works Gerard David painted in Bruges  in the same period

27131-still_3.jpg	This painting is a variation on the artist's style as seen in his other works. However, the individual objects are no longer scattered across the forest ground but are grouped together in an arched niche, to form a fruit-basket motif that resembles the display of a harvest festival.The painting contains both Eucharistic symbols and an element of transience, indicated by the small number of rotten spots of the fruit, as well as the presence of a clock, and the dualism of good and evil. The two rather cute little animals, a squirrel and a goldfinch, are also in opposition to each other. The squirrel seems to be chained up, but on closer inspection we notice that it has managed to free itself. It has cracked open a walnut and is now eating its kernel. The squirrel had been regarded as a symbol of the evil since the Middle Ages. In this painting it embodies the unleashing of evil in the form of harmlessness. The bell collar around its neck also identifies it as a 'fool' and thus a sinner. The meaning of a squirrel eating walnut becomes obvious when we consider that St Augustine saw the walnut as a symbol of Christ, with the shell as the wood of the cross and the kernel as the life-giving nature of Christ.Unlike the squirrel, the goldfinch is a christological symbol, particularly with reference to the Passion. Its positive meaning can be gathered from its position in the upper portion of the painting (top=sphere of salvation). The actions of the bird are worth nothing. Chained to an arched semicircle, from which it can peck food out of a small container, it is pulling up a thimble-sized receptacle from the left-hand edge of the shelf. It is filled with water or - more likely - wine (as a Eucharistic symbol of the blood of Christ), which has been scooped out of a conical glass without stem or base

Antonio del Pollaiuolo, in collaboration with his brother Piero, painted here the patron saints of the young cardinal, Vincent, James of Compostela and Eustace, enhancing more preciouseness and of clothes and jewels than sacred value of figures.

00547-3west.jpg	While the main thematic emphasis on the east wall is on the pastoral and missionary work of the Dominicans, the fresco on the west wall - which is generally known as the Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas, even if this is not an accurate description - has as its fundamental theme the scientific and academic contributions of the order, exemplified in the person of Aquinas.The composition is strictly schematic and joins a wealth of personifications and historical exempla in a serial and symmetric arrangement. In the middle of the upper section, St Thomas Aquinas, seated on a throne and surrounded by an aureole, presents an open book to the viewer. Floating above the saint's throne are the four cardinal virtues and the three theological virtues, the topmost being Caritas. Seated to the left of Thomas, from the viewer's standpoint, are Job, David, Paul, Mark, and John the Evangelist; to the right, Solomon, Isaiah, Moses, Luke, and Matthew. Crouching at the feet of the saint, their bearing and gestures expressing resignation, are the heretics, Sabellius, Averro&#235;s, and Arius.In the lower register a uniform row of fourteen thrones extends like a line of choir stalls across the wall. Seated on the thrones on the right side are female personifications of the liberal arts, their antique and biblical representatives at their feet. The identification of the female figures on the left side is more difficult. According to Vasari they represent the seven theological sciences, but there are other assumptions, too

18211-0304grec.jpg	Three versions of this subject are known, all basically the same in composition, but differing in treatment. The earliest, an unsigned panel in Dresden, is looser in composition, smaller in conception, and introduces genre motifs of a dog, sack and pitcher in the foreground, eliminated in subsequent versions. The second painting, now in Parma, probably also painted in Venice, is more easily composed. The third and largest painting, now in New York (possibly identical with the one in a Madrid collection at the time of Cossio's pioneer work on El Greco), with its comparative largeness of conception, belongs to his Roman period, after 1570. This version was earlier attributed to Tintoretto, then Veronese. In Madrid, there is also a 17th century copy of the painting.The version in New York is the most sketchy in execution and is, in fact, unfinished. The two seated figures in the middle ground were so thinly painted that the pavement is visible through them.Until recently there was a consensus of opinion that the New York version was the latest of the three treatments of the subject and possibly dated  from El Greco's first years in Spain. However, in 1991 a number of scholars dated it between the Dresden and Parma pictures. The question of datation is open

21319-08newbo.jpg	The subject is ambigious because the spectator is uncertain whether it is a simple genre scene or whether it represents the Virgin, St Anne and the Christ Child.By common consent La Tour's best picture is the New-born. At first sight this now-famous work seems starkly simple, a refinement of the already-familiar mannerisms and abbreviations, and only close inspection of the relatively small-scale picture reveals its complexity. The technique is almost pointiliste: the intense red of the mother's dress  is achieved by minute dots of colour of varying hue, and the same is true of the lilac garment of the servant (or St Anne, if the subject is the Christ Child). The whole surface is thus the product of an intensely concentrated effort, and a large amount of detail is concealed in the stark simplicity of the forms. The collar of the mother's dress is elaborately decorated, and the profiles are painted with an exceptional delicacy of line.A total calm pervades the picture, in which the faces have been described as almost Buddha-like in their serenity. The sentiments which characterize almost all the rest of seventeenth-century painting are avoided, and this picture alone justifies La Tour's reputation.

18278-0901grec.jpg	The contract for the painting is dated 18th March 1586. El Greco agreed to finish the painting by Christmas of the same year. This commission again resulted in litigation over the valuation, the final outcome of which was that the artist accepted the amount of the original valuation, 1200 ducados.The painting illustrates a popular local legend. In 1312, a certain Don Gonzalo Ru�z, native of Toledo, and Se&#241;or of the town of Orgaz, died (the family received the title of Count, by which he is generally known, only later). He was a pious man who, among other charitable acts, left moneys for the enlargement and adornment of the church of Santo Tom� (El Greco's parish church). At his burial, Saint Stephen and Saint Augustine intervened to lay him to rest. The occasion for the commission of the painting for the chapel in which the Se&#241;or was buried, was the resumption of the tribute payable to the church by the town of Orgaz, which had been withheld for over two centuries.The painting remains in the chapel - the actual scene of the event - for which it was ordered. Already in 1588, people flocked to see the painting. This immediate popular reception depended, however, on the 'life-like portrayal of the notable men of Toledo of the time'. Indeed, this painting is sufficient to rank El Greco among the few great portrait painters. Nowadays the painting can communicate to us a whole society and age, as perhaps no other single work of art can, and at the same time offer us one of the great marvels of painting.It was the custom for the eminent and noble men of the town to assist at the burial of the high-born, and it was stipulated in the contract that the scene should be represented in this way. Without the contemporary confirmation, it would be clear that all are portraits. Unfortunately, there is no record of the identity of the sitters. Andr�s N�&#241;ez, the parish priest, and a friend of El Greco's, who was responsible for the commission, is certainly the figure on the extreme right. The artist himself can be recognised in the caballero third from the left, immediately above the head of Saint Stephen. The artist's son acts as the young page. The signature of the artist appears on the handkerchief in the pocket of the young boy, and by a strange conceit it is followed by the date '1578' - the year of Jorge Manuel's birth, and certainly not the date of the painting. The boy points to the body of the deceased, thus bringing together birth and death.The painting is very clearly divided into two zones, the heavenly above and the terrestrial below, but there is little feeling of duality. The upper and lower zones are brought together compositionally (e.g., by the standing figures, by their varied participation in the earthly and heavenly event, by the torches, cross, . . .). The grand circular mandorla-like pattern of the two Saints descended from Heaven echoes the pattern formed by the Virgin and Saint John the Baptist, and the action is given explicit expression. The point of equilibrium is the outstretched hand poised in the void between the two Saints, whence the mortal body descends, and the Soul, in the medieval form of a transparent and naked child, is taken up by the angel to be received in Heaven. The supernatural appearance of the Saints is enhanced by the splendour of colour and light of their gold vestments. The powerful cumulative emotion expressed by the group of participants is suffused and sustained through the composition by the splendour, variety and vitality of the colour and of light.This is the first completely personal work by the artist. There are no longer any references to Roman or Venetian formulas or motifs. He has succeeded in eliminating any description of space. There is no ground, no horizon, no sky and no perspective. Accordingly, there is no conflict, and a convincing expression of a supernatural space is achieved. This is the beginning of his real development, and the process of dematerialisation and spiritualisation continues

05394-tulips.jpg	This floral still-life is one of Johannes Bosschaert's earliest and most original works showing tulips growing in their natural environment and surrounded by insects and a frog.Tulips are native to Turkey. The botanist Carolus Clusius, professor of botany at Leiden University from 1593, brought the first tulip bulbs to the Netherlands as floral curiosities. Within a few decades, the tulips had become the most fashionable of flowers. Experimentation produced countless new varieties, and the expanding market, combined with speculation, led to widespread tulip mania. Towards the end of the 1620s, tulip bulbs were literally worth their weight in gold, but then in 1637 the bubble burst. Many people were ruined but fortunately the tulip did not disappear from Holland, and it is still a symbol of the country today

19227-85regen.jpg	The two great portrait groups of the Regents and Regentesses of the Old Men's Alms House in Haarlem, which today both hang in the Frans Halsmuseum in the town, are traditionally said to have been painted in 1664. The five Regents portrayed by Hals held their offices from 1662 to 1665 and it was very usual to mark the end of their term of office by commissioning a group portrait of this kind. They are Jonas de Jong, Mattheus Everswijn, Dr Cornelis Westerloo, Daniel Deinoot and Johannes Walles. As no documented portraits of these men survive, it has proved impossible to link the names to individual portraits.There is an old legend that Hals, reduced to poverty in his last years and an inmate of the Alms House, took his revenge on the Regents by depicting them in unflattering fashion. In fact, although he was certainly poor, he was never in the Alms House and the bold, free and animated style of the group is also evident in his other portraits of this period. It has been convincingly argued that the unusual expression on the face of the Regent who is seated on the right is the consequence of partial facial paralysis rather than - as the legend has it - drunkenness. Such candour is characteristic of Hals who felt no need to disguise the Regent's affliction. The standing figure, without a hat, is the servant of the Regents.These two group portraits, painted at the very end of Hals's long career, display the remarkable shorthand that he (and other great painters in old age) discovered. No brushstroke is out of place or extraneous: there is no unimportant description of detail but a concentration upon essentials, the evocation of character in a few unerringly placed brushstrokes

18783-guard406.jpg	The buildings on the Grand Canal near Santa Lucia, on the left, and the church of the Discalced Carmelites, the Scalzi, to the right of centre, cover almost the entire width of the scene. The Grand Canal narrows near the entrance to the Rio dell'Isola, the present-day Lista di Spagna. As a figure-head the still extant house stands at the junction of the two waterways. Beside it stands the large Palazzo Calbo-Grotta, where the Grand Canal curves out of view toward the east. The painter observed these buildings from the Fondamenta di San Simeone, from an elevated vantage point looking down on the quay. The tall side wall on the right obstructs the view of nearby San Simeone Piccolo. There are gondolas scattered over the water, and also moored to the quays here and there. Guardi studied them carefully, as becomes apparent from a pen and wash drawing that corresponds with the canvas precisely.Santa Lucia as well as the Lion and Rezzonico Palaces adjacent to it were demolished in about 1860 to make way for the present railroad station. In front of the Scalzi, which narrowly escaped the same fate, a permanent bridge over the Grand Canal was built.Together with its companion (also in the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid), the painting affords a complete picture of the buildings along the Grand Canal at the level of Santa Lucia and San Simeone Piccolo, one of the loveliest parts of Venice at the time and frequently chosen by Guardi as the subject for his paintings.  The late style of Francesco Guardi, characterized by a light, almost transparent tonality with blonde shades, is superbly exemplified by these paintings. The compositions of two views Guardi painted of Santa Lucia and San Simeone Piccolo, now in the Akademie der bildenden K�nste, Vienna, are virtually identical.The painter who introduced this part of Venice in topographical painting was Canaletto. Following his example Antonio Visentini made an etching for the series Prospectus Magni Canalis Venetiarum, published in 1735 and 1742. Canaletto included both sides of the canal in the scene and he chose a more distant standpoint in the bend of the canal near the Fondamenta della Croce

35102-democrix.jpg	"Democritus, the great pre-Socratic philosopher and founder of a strictly materialist concept of the world sought new explanations for birth and death, appearance and disappearance. According to his theory of ""atomism"", atoms are the smallest parts of all substances, uniting and dividing in eternal swirling movements. His ethical system called for a life of moderation and tranquillity foregoing most sensual joys.Rosa depicts him in the traditional pose of melancholy, amidst a setting of decay, destruction and desolation. Animal skulls and bones, symbols of the past greatness of antiquity (vase, altar and herm) and symbols of fallen power (the dead eagle) are featured in this wasteland overcast with heavy grey clouds. An owl high in the tree is his only living companion, both a sign of night and of wisdom. Rosa's Democritus is not the philosopher who has reached the goal of his contemplation, nor does he represent serene tranquillity or the superior cognitive powers of the analytic mind. Instead, we see a forsaken thinker contemplating the things that have been the subject of his intellectual endeavours: death, the past, turbulent disquietude, fragmentation.

33564-093portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 276.Jan Six, the subject of this remarkable portrait which is among the greatest painted by Rembrandt, was a friend and patron of the artist. Six (1618-1700) came from a noble Huguenot family which had fled to Amsterdam from Saint Omer in France at the end of the sixteenth century and amassed a fortune in the textile trade and from silk dyeing. Six was involved in the family business until he entered civic politics in Amsterdam, serving as burgomaster of the city in 1691. Passionately interested in the arts, particularly poetry, Six was a member of the so-called Muiderkring (Muiden circle) which gathered around Pieter Cornelisz. Hooft, and he published volumes of poetry and plays. He was an avid collector of works of art - Dutch and Italian masters, antique sculpture, engraved gems - and travelled widely, including an extended trip to Italy in 1640.Six owned a number of paintings by Rembrandt, among them the grisaille Preaching of John the Baptist (Berlin, Gem&#228;ldegalerie). Their relationship was, however, one of friendship rather than simply that of patron and artist. Rembrandt etched the title page for Six's tragedy Medea and made two drawings for his Album Amicorum in 165Z.This portrait, which is still owned by a direct descendant of the sitter, also Jan Six, captures the moment as Six pauses while putting on his gloves just before leaving the house. The hands, gloves and red cloak are painted very broadly in powerful strokes with a loaded brush, but the face, with its marvellous expression of momentary abstraction, has been heavily and precisely worked and reworked. It is one of Rembrandt's most sensitive and effective portraits and a remarkable tribute to the friendship between the two men. Three years later Rembrandt etched a portrait of Six standing at his window reading, with books and manuscripts in the foreground and a painting hanging on the wall: it is a study of Six as poet and collector

37069-60parhel.jpg	The picture shows the frescoes on the altar wall of the chapel: The Elect Being Called to Paradise (left) and The Damned Being Plunged into Hell (right). In the window embrasures are angels and Sts Brizio and Constantius, while in the tondi of the side window embrasures, the archangel Michael and a demon (left) and the archangel Raphael with Tobias (right).There is no doubt that Luca's portrayal of the Elect is far less convincing than his fresco of the Damned. Despite his extremely accurate studies of the human body, his depiction of Paradise is no more than a conventional catalogue of good sentiments and the overall effect is one of unmitigated dullness. The same is true of the pair of frescoes depicting the Elect being called to Paradise and the Damned being plunged into Hell.Although each covers a half wall interrupted by an arch, the scene of the blessed being summoned to heaven is unimaginative and common-place, with its pretty musician angels and chocolate-box portrayals of the Elect. Whereas the scene of the Damned is constructed around the visionary, almost surrealistic, idea of these crowds of naked figures jostling for space along the banks of the Acheron, and the splendid group in the foreground of the devil whipping a terrified, screaming sinner (reminiscent of a Pollaiolo figure). Michelangelo was clearly fascinated by this powerful scene of cruelty and did a drawing of it

According to the story, the satyr assisted a peasant who had become lost on a winter's day. The satyr was astonished to see that the peasant was able to warm his hands by blowing onto them. In thanks for his help, the peasant invited the satyr to eat with him. The scene depicted here is the moment when the satyr leaps from the table in disgust when the peasant blows on the hot soup to cool it. The satyr renounced the peasant's friendship, declaring he would ""have nothing to do with one who blows hot and cold with the same breath.""Sebastiano Ricci returned to this subject on a number of occasions, a testament to its popularity.

08428-boybask.jpg	This painting is on deposit from a private collection. Ceruti was a specialist in depicting poor people, labourers, cripples and beggars in life-size figures on large canvases. He composed his pictures in the pale tints of the dust and rags in which his mendicants, known as 'pitocchi,' dwelt. And for this strange speciality, Ceruti came to be called by the uncomplimentary nickname 'il pitocchetto', the 'little beggar.'Ceruti often painted the seemingly countless boys who earned a meagre living as porters for hire in the city streets. The winters are cold in Brescia, near the Alps, a young boy has wrapped himself as warmly as possible, his buttonless jacket tied with a rope. He strides purposefully across an open space, not breaking his stride, but looks directly at us.

37083-9decora2.jpg	The only one of the busts of philosophers and poets that can be identified with certainty is Dante Alighieri, and some of the loveliest and most famous of the monochromes are illustrations of episodes from the Divine Comedy - for the most part from Purgatory. In these Orvieto frescoes Signorelli proves that he is a talented illustrator of Dante, but what is truly fascinating is that he has succeeded in giving an interpretation of the Divine Comedy that is evocative and visionary, so similar to more modern styles that one can't help but compare it to the work of such artists as Fuseli, Blake, Gustave Dor�. If one is still searching for evidence of Luca Signorelli's inventive genius and of his astonishing versatility, then these decorations will provide it.This picture shows The Angel Arrives in Purgatory

17208-olive10.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 818, JH 1848.Van Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum at Saint-R�my in May 1889 as a third-class voluntary patient. In the first weeks of his treatment he did not leave the area of the asylum and he only started to paint outside the walls in June 1889. During the rest of the summer the worsening of his condition did not make it possible for him to work outside, thus in July and August he painted mostly portraits and he copied pictures of his favourite artists, Millet and Delacroix.Following the hardships of the summer months spent in the asylum, van Gogh continued his series of paintings of olive orchards. He painted about thirty canvases of the subject where he wanted to express the rural, close-to-nature character of the motif by using orange and bluish tones. He experimented on a personal, impressionistic style while painting olive orchards and developed it further on landscapes painted during the autumn; the present painting is an example of it

40756-01icon.jpg	Novgorod Veliky (Novgorod the Great) is one of the oldest Russian towns. In the 12th to 15th centuries it was the centre of a large republic, whose art was greatly influenced by popular ideas of beauty. This was especially striking in the art of painting of the 13th and early 14th centuries, the period to which the Hermitage icon of Saint Nicholas is dated. Its red background is usually noted, for the vivid red (cinnabar) background combined with the lemon-coloured halo and the bluishgreen vestment of the saint make a striking impression. The beauty of the icon is enhanced by the careful graphic treatment of the forms and by the ornamental design.St Nicholas was the most highly venerated saint in early Russia. The iconography of the saint is traditional for 13-century Novgorod. The red background is a characteristic feature of the Novgorodian school of icon-painting.The saint is represented as sublime and severe in accordance with the standard developed in the Christian art of Byzantium. But the vivid colours and embellishments adopted from folk art soften the hieratic posture and stern countenance, turning the austere Byzantine saint into the Russian Nik�la, who was believed to be involved in all of humans' daily doings and cares

42113-01arezz3.jpg	Vasari bought his house in Arezzo which had a plot of a land attached. Once the room had been built, he made a jewel of the house, personally overseeing the decoration of the 'piano nobile' during those periods between 1542 and 1548 when his working commitments in other cities allowed him to do so. In 1550 Vasari married Nicolosa Bacci, and they went to live in the house; or rather , she did, because in March that year Vasari moved to Rome where he was extremely busy. In 1554 the artist left Rome to settle finally in Florence, where he lived with his wife, who left the house in Arezzo, it became a second home where Giorgio gathered works of art and to which he retired for brief periods of rest. After the Vasari family died out the house became a museum and Vasari Archive. The later private owners rebuilt and redecorated the house, but eight rooms retained its original decoration by Vasari.The picture shows the ceiling decoration of the Sala di Apollo (Apollo Room), one of the two bedrooms in the house. In the central tondo Apollo is depicted. The supporting vaults, two of which are shown here, represent the Nine Muses. Erato, the goddess of conjugal love, has the features of the artist's wife

26099-26vani1.jpg	Not only is this work unique in Memling's oeuvre, its theme and form also make it extremely unusual for the art of its era. Physical examination shows that we are dealing with three small panels, which were painted on both sides but subsequently separated. The little triptych is not, however, Memling's first painting on an allegorical and moralising theme, and belongs to the series that also includes the Allegory of True Love and the Allegory with a virgin. It must have been a folding meditative painting, which could be stood on a cabinet with its wings slightly open. The front of the triptych featured the naked woman in the middle flanked by Death and the Devil, each with an admonitory banderole. The only actual scene on the rear is that of heaven, which appears between emblematic subjects - the coat-of-arms and the skull - in the wings. The texts refer to the end of mankind and the way to its salvation. By making the naked woman looking in a mirror the principal scene, the work becomes an erotic Vanitas allegory, a motif that was not destined to become popular until the sixteenth century.The purely erotic character of the nude is indeed exceptional for its time. This is the only example in which the female genitals are shown uncovered. This woman, with a diadem in her long hair, who looks in the mirror and unashamedly shows off her nakedness but for the sandals on her feet, simultaneously represents Vanity and Lust. She is the antithesis of the virgin in the little painting in the Mus�e Jacquemart-Andr�. To her left there is a griffon, a breed of dog that is customarily included in paintings whose subject is marriage or physical love. The significance of the amorous greyhounds on the right is also clear. The watermill, which constantly alludes in Memling to the Incarnation and which is once again placed prominently in the landscape, might be intended here as a contrast with the sinful ways of the flesh portrayed in the foreground. The woman's genitals in the Vanity scene correspond with the toad - the demonic creature to be seen over the genitals of Death. It is not possible to determine from any physical clues whether this panel was originally located to the left or right of the central panel.In terms of composition (poses and the positioning of the banderoles) the layout presented here - with Death and Hell to the left and right respectively - would appear most satisfactory. The glowing reflection of the flames on the bodies in the jaws of hell recalls the Gdansk Last Judgment

08464-flight.jpg	In the studio of Cavaliere d'Arpino (Giuseppe Cesari), one of the most influential artist in Rome during the pontificate of Clement VIII, painters from northern Europe were numerous. From this Cavaliere d'Arpino probably derived his inclination for painting religious scenes in a landscape. He produced delicate devotional paintings on copper or panel on a very small scale. In them, his lives of the saints or biblical episodes were enriched by imaginative additions. The Rest on the Flight into Egypt depicts the moment when a palm tree bends down at the request of the Christ Child so that Joseph can pick the dates that Mary has asked for. This miraculous event adds a touch of familiarity and intimacy to the well-known story of the Holy Family's flight

35282-1king.jpg	Frederick Augustus was born in 1696, the son of Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, who from 1697 was King Augustus II (the Strong) of Poland. During his educational travels from 1711 to 1719 through Germany, Switzerland, Italy and France, the Prince Elector converted to Catholicism in 1712 while at Bologna. In 1719 he married the Austrian Archduchess Maria Josepha and in 1733 succeeded his father to the throne as Elector of Saxony and King of Poland. His reign saw a blossoming of the arts in Dresden, not only the visual arts, but also music, opera and architecture. Augustus III died in Dresden on 5 October 1763.Rotari's portrait shows the monarch wearing his breastplate under a blue coat and supporting his left hand on his staff, with before him part of his ermine robe. Set resplendently on his chest is the Catholic Order of the Golden Fleece, and almost completely obscured on the lower left is the Polish Order of the White Eagle hanging on a blue ribbon

24985-catholi.jpg	Christ's first miracle, the transformation of water into wine, is described in John (2:1-12). Invited to a wedding in Galilee, Mary told her son that the family was too poor to afford wine. At the wedding table, Jesus raises his right hand in benediction, while Mary prays in recognition of the miracle. The governor of the feast looks skeptically into his cup, but the bride and groom lower their eyes in reverent acceptance of the divine gift.The banqueting hall combines elements from Netherlandish and Spanish culture. The trumpeters in the gallery, the wedding bed, the servants in the distant kitchen, and the northern European town seen through the door and window show a Flemish concern for documenting daily life. The harsh, angular features of some male figures, the rich brown and red tonalities, and the costumes and serving vessels, however, are more typical of Castile. Hanging from the rafters, shields bear coats of arms suggesting that this scene may be an allegory on the marriage in 1497 of Juan of Castile, son of the Catholic Kings, to Margaret of Austria, daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor

42275-0609vela.jpg	"The satirical tradition had spread throughout Europe via the humanists, and Vel�zquez's knowledge of it is evident in his use of ideal types in portraits of the Cynic philosopher Menippus and the Greek composer of animal fables Aesop, possibly painted for the hunting lodge Torre de la Parada, near the Buen Retiro Palace. Both figures are shown full length and would have made suitable counterparts to the pictures of Democritus and Heraclitus by Rubens in the Torre de la Parada. It was here, too, that many of Vel�zquez's portraits of court fools and dwarfs were hung.Aesop's face with its flattened nose was probably not - as is commonly thought - painted after a man of the people (even if the painting did attempt to show a simple man whose features were marked by toil, and who therefore represented the Cynic ideal of the modesty and wisdom of the people). The portrait seems rather more reminiscent of Giovanni Battista della Porta's physiognomic parallels between various types of human faces and the heads of animals associated with certain temperaments. Vel�zquez gave Aesop's face the fleshy features of the human ""ox-head type"" described in the physiognomical doctrines of della Porta, published in 1586, which calls Aesop's animal fables to mind.Of greater importance, however, are the eyes: one almost feels that in the landscape of Aesop's face they are all that is left of the grounding of the canvas. They are deep-seated and probing, turned on the observer with a slight touch of contempt. Like the eyes of many of Vel�zquez's dwarfs and fools, their gaze is full of the irony that sees through convention. Aesop, who lived from about 620 to 560 BC, began life as a slave and died a violent death. In this picture his face, marked by suffering, shows the same simple dignity as that of the court jesters or country folk painted by Vel�zquez.According to Plutarch, Aesop was a counsellor to the Lydian King Croesus (6th century). Vel�zquez was suggesting a parallel with the situation at the Spanish court. The two portraits of philosophers, together with the portraits of fools and dwarfs, were intended to warn the king not to lose touch with the common people and their wisdom"

The coats of arms, added shortly after and placed on the external side beside the portraits, were those of the same family, even though the coats of arms are different: one has a cross between two fish, the other an upside-down lily.The emperor Sigismund had authorized the families of ecclesiastic members to add a cross to their own coats of arms. For this reason, it was deduced that the young woman portrayed with loose hair, the coral bracelet, the hands joined in prayer, and her head bowed down had devoted herself to the cloistered life. The Latin inscription added to the engraving Wenzel Hollar modeled on this painting, also recommended following in the path of Christ.The very fine brushstrokes of this exquisite painting and the sharp distinction between the areas in light and those in shadow give the face a sense of plasticity, endowing it with a particularly vivid expression. Scholars demonstrated that the two portraits truly formed a pair and that they were acquired together in 1636 in Nuremberg by the count of Arundel, whose engraver, Wenzel Hollar, made two engravings modeled from them. It should be noted that the young woman with the loose hair also rests her arms on a window sill.In 1673, the portraits were acquired, together as always, by the bishop of Olm�tz, from whom they later went on to Carl von Waagen, of Munich. Afterward, the two portraits were separated

21951-5ceilin.jpg	All that remains of Leonardo's decorations in the Castello Sforzesco in Milan are some fragments in the Sala delle Asse which were, when discovered towards the end of the 19th century, restored in such a way that it is scarcely possible anymore to make out their original appearance. Leonardo's plan was to cover the vaulted ceiling of the Sala with a complicated network of twigs and leaves growing from the tree trunks painted on the side walls, together with the blue of the sky in-between, create the illusion of a jumble of branches beneath an open sky			
32283-11holyf.jpg	Dating from his mature period, this canvas reflects in its figural arrangement a thorough study of such High Renaissance artists as Raphael and Andrea del Sarto, while the background reveals Possin's genius in adapting classical architecture to a religious theme. Concerned with achieving a perfectly harmonized composition, the artist has contained the figures within a triangular format; the heads of the Virgin and the Christ Child being at the apex of this pyramid. Although Poussin, the son of a minor government official in Normandy, spent almost the whole of his adult life in Rome, he was held in the highest esteem in France, and more than any other single figure, influenced the course of the seventeenth-century French painting

03895-185serm.jpg	"On the death of Gentile, Giovanni Bellini inherited from his brother the celebrated sketchbooks of their father Jacopo, though on one condition: that he finish the large canvas with the Sermon of St Mark in Alexandria, commissioned by the Scuola Grande di San Marco, which Gentile had started in 1504. On 18 February 1506, in fact, when Gentile dictated his last will, the canvas was already ""in large part done"", though not finished. It was the Scuola di San Marco itself that confirmed Bellini's assignment to complete the painting on 7 March of the same year, a few days after the death of his brother.The plan of the large ""historia"", conceived as an ordered representation on a wide stage closed on three sides by large architectural walls, was clearly Gentile s. The style of the architecture, suggested to the painter during his journey in the East (where he had been sent by the Republic in 1479 in the retinue of a diplomatic mission) is reminiscent of Mameluke prototypes, which led to the speculation that Gentile may have proceeded from Constantinople to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage, and from there have recorded new architectural ideas that were different from Ottoman styles, the. latter being more familiar to Venetians.The official narrative, however, hinges on the crowd gathered around the preaching saint in the square, where, according to Venetian canons of public portraiture, the characters appear as a socially and hierarchically defined group.Critics have advanced a number of theories concerning the extent to which either brother was responsible for the painting of this large human group. Apart from Vasari, who in the first edition of the Lives (1550) mentioned Gentile as the only author of the painting, only to drop this idea in the second edition (1568), the old historiographers attributed the Sermon to both brothers without entering into detail about the individual contributions.Modern critics see Giovanni as the hand behind the more precisely psychologically analyzed portraits, placed in the central group, many of whom are shown with a three-quarter turn, and of some characters on the far left. Others assert that St Mark himself, in addition to the senator listening on the right, may be the work of Giovanni.Here too the research carried out before and during the last restoration was useful in giving new and more precise answers to the problem, revealing the numerous modifications of arrangement and character that some faces have undergone, and the additions and corrections applied to a part of the drawing of the buildings.But beyond the precise detailed statements, which are in fact secondary, the intervention of Giovanni should be evaluated on the overall conception of the composition. Moving and animating the characters, indeed, restoring to them a unique and peculiar individuality, lightening, even if slightly, the severity of Gentile's ""order"", Giovanni went beyond the solemn historical consecration typical of his brother's great narrations and imprinted in the ""story"" a human dimension together with a masterly development towards modernity"

07639-death_sf.jpg	In this extraordinary picture, which demonstrates both his indebtness to Florentine colleagues and his great importance to the formation of a new style of religious painting at Spanish court,  Carducho builds a moving, humanized narrative on the armature of the classical style.The composition is nearly symmetrical, the figures carefully drawn and posed, the gestures and expressions exquisitely calibrated to evince deep, internalised grief. Even more than his Florentine models, Carducho individualizes the physical traits of the figures. The rough, appealing humanity of the Franciscans seems to be the artist's response to Spanish taste for a new realism in devotional pictures which would only increase in the years to come.Carducho's potent use of light is another notable element: it intensifies the presence of the figures and glances off the inanimate objects, endowing each with a characteristic texture. The saint's scuffed, worn sandals, an earthenware chamber-pot, a bowl of thin broth, a tawny human skull, and an hourglass with the sands of time running out - all are depicted with an authentic feel that draws the viewer into the unfolding drama of the saint's pious death.

44666-firenze1.jpg	The painting shows a topographically accurate view of the Piazza della Signoria looking east, with the Palazzo Vecchio and the Loggia dei Lanzi, and figures gathered around a puppet-show.The Piazza della Signoria takes its name from the Palazzo Vecchio (or Palazzo della Signoria), which from the 13th century was the meeting-place for government and is still used as the town hall of Florence today. Straight ahead is the 14th-century Loggia dei Lanzi (1376-82), so named after Cosimo I de' Medici's Swiss lancers. Its function as an open-air sculpture gallery persists today, and Cellini's Perseus (1545) and Giambologna's Rape of the Sabine (1583) are still on display on the same sites. Other sculptures visible in the painting are still in situ today: Giambologna's equestrian statue of Cosimo I (1587-94), Ammannati's fountain of Neptune (1565-75), Michelangelo's David (albeit a cast of the original; 1501-4), and Bandinelli's Hercules and Cacus (1534).

23781-colonna.jpg	The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).Under the sons of Filippo II Colonna (1663-1714) more additions were made to the palace. A new wing was erected between 1730-33 by Nicola Michetti. Of this wing only the corner pavilion has survived unchanged, and in it is one of the loveliest interiors from the Roman Rococo. The room was also designed by Michetti. The square space, which is referred to as the Coffeehouse and was in fact used as a public caf� up to the 1930s, fits the type of the small pleasure house that became fashionable in the eighteenth century. On the ceiling, consisting of a circular centre panel framed by eight spandrels, Francesco Mancini illustrated the Legend of Psyche in 1733. The playful style of the painting is perfectly attuned to the character of the wall decorations, which supplement the painted program with stucco reliefs and niche figures

12351-colonna.jpg	The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).The modernization of the interiors was begun in the Appartamento Estivo on the ground floor of the palace. The picture shows one of the halls where the walls are decorated with wall-high simulated openings presenting views of either Arcadian, idyllic countryside or stormy and peaceful seascapes. The painted architecture is the work of Giovanni Battista Magno, while the fourteen landscapes are by Gaspard Dughet.Employing the light colours typical of tempera painting, Dughet, who here followed directly in the footsteps of Paul Bril and Agostino Tassi, managed to give his landscapes, with their imaginatively arranged motifs from the Roman 'campagna', an idyllic and cheerful air. Dughet's careful preparation for the wall paintings is documented by precise design drawings that even include details of the staffage. With their uniform and continuous horizon, these wall paintings, reproduced in the years 1781 and 1813 in complete sets of engravings, are also an important precursor of the landscape panoramas so popular in the later eighteenth century

05239-11eouter.jpg	The scene on the outer wings of the Haywain triptych is called Wayfarer or the Path of Life.The foreground is dominated by an emaciated, shabbily dressed man who is no longer young, carrying a wicker basket strapped to his back; he travels through a menacing landscape. A skull and several bones lie scattered at lower left; an ugly cur snaps at his heels, while the footbridge on which he is about to step appears very fragile indeed. In the background, bandits have robbed another traveller and are binding him to a tree, and peasants dance at the right to the skirl of a bagpipe. A crowd of people gather around an enormous gallows in the distance, not far from a tall pole surmounted by a wheel, used for displaying the bodies of executed criminals.Bosch's pilgrim makes his way through the treacherous world whose vicissitudes are represented in the landscape. Some of the dangers are physical, such as the robbers or the snarling dog, although the latter may also symbolize detractors and slanderers, whose evil tongues were often compared to barking dogs. The dancing peasants, however, connote a moral danger; like the lovers on top of the haywain, they have succumbed to the music of the flesh. In expressing the spiritual predicament of all mankind, the pilgrim thus resembles Everyman and his Dutch and German counterparts Elckerlijc and Jedermann, whose spiritual pilgrimages form the subjects of contemporary morality plays

Linking the frescoes and the central panel painting in this way Ghirlandaio creates what is almost a triptych.Francesco Sassetti's dealings as a patron of the arts were not characterized by commercial acumen or sound business sense. It is almost as if he wanted to record his pointed rejection of the commercial mentality. As his reputation as a banker faded, people made fun of him by saying that he would rather study Cicero than his account books.At the base is the painted inscription: A.D. MCCCCLXXX. XV decembris.

37122-2m_child.jpg	The Virgin is portrayed sitting in a flowery meadow, against a background of young athletes (probaly to be interpreted as allegoric of ascetic virtues); towering above her are the monochrome figures of John the Baptist and two prophets. Vasari tells us that the painting was presented by Luca to Lorenzo the Magnificent and there can be no doubt that the learned symbolism and the allegorical references it contains would have been fully appreciated by the Medici Court, whose religious ideals in those years were founded on highly intellectual and philosophical studies, deeply imbued with Platonism and Classicism. Even the figurative references contained in this painting are extremely varied and sophisticated. There are references to Piero della Francesca's descendants of Adam (the young man in the background), to archeological elements, as well as tributes to Flemish painting (the monochromes in the upper part); and, above all, there is an explicit reference to Leonardo and his followers in the flowery meadow in the foreground, in the toned down colours, in the careful attention paid to chiaroscuro values

09794-triumph.jpg	The Bentivoglio family chapel in San Giacomo Maggiore, Bologna was restructured and enlarged by Giovanni II Bentivoglio. The remodeled chapel was dedicated in 1499. In November 1506, the papal armies led by Pope Julius II himself, occupied Bologna, and Giovanni II Bentivoglio was excommunicated and imprisoned in the Castello Sforzesco, where he died in 1508. The papal authorities demolished his residences, and the only space that was spared was the Bentivoglio family chapel in San Giacomo Maggiore. It may be that the subject matter of its canvases by Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia, which included a depiction of some of the misfortunes and deaths that had dogged the Bentivoglio, helped to save them.The paintings in the chapel consist of two allegorical depictions, the Triumph of Fame and the Triumph of Death, and a votive image that is one of the most  important visual documents attesting to the family's considerable self-esteem. In it Giovanni II and his wife Ginevra Sforza, his predecessor's widow, kneel in gratitude on either side of an enthroned Madonna. Their numerous daughters and sons are arrayed in the foreground before them.This painting was commissioned to celebrate the timely discovery of the Malvezzi conspiracy on November 1488, a bit of luck that saved the lives of the Bentivoglio and preserved their rule over the city

26158-40obrech.jpg	This portrait represents the renowned composer Jacob Obrecht. The artist and the subject was identified on the basis of a number of correspondences, including the year, the man's age, the inscription with his name, the fact that he is attired as a priest, and the very high quality of the painting, which suggests an artist of a stature to match the composer's own. Jacob Obrecht, or Hobrecht as he is generally called in the sources, earned international fame during his lifetime. This is the first portrait of him to come to light. Obrecht was the son of the Ghent city trumpeter Willem Hobrecht. If he was 38 in 1496 (as written on the frame), he must have been born in 1458. The composer Obrecht was appointed choirmaster at Cambrai Cathedral in 1484. Following his dismissal for mismanagement, he was given the corresponding post (succentor) at St Donatian's in Bruges. He was granted six months leave in 1487 to go and work at the court of Ferrara, at the request of Duke Ercole I d'Este. He was subsequently connected with Our Lady's in Antwerp between 1492 and 1496, before being reappointed in Bruges on 31 December 1498. He travelled to the court of Ferrara for a second time in 1504, where he died of plague in 1505.Jacob Obrecht has longish chestnut-brown hair, fairly robust features, and wears a transparent surplice over a brownish toga. The dark green collar with black lining is folded under the surplice on one side, revealing the black collar of the laced-up waistcoat beneath. He has a grey fur almuce about his left wrist, the standard attribute of the canons of a chapter church. He is shown in three-quarter view against a light blue-green background. His name is written in gold, calligraphic letters on either side of his head: Ja[cob] Hobrecht. The reverse features a standing female figure in grisaille, wearing a long dress, and reading from an open book which she holds at waist height. The sitter will originally have been looking towards the figure of a saint or a religious scene. Hinge-marks on the right-hand side of the frame confirm this beyond doubt. It is not certain, however, whether this was the painter's original intention.The date 1496 (two years after Memling's death) appearing on the frame must refer to the later installation or completion by another artist of a diptych or triptych left unfinished. The later addition of the grisaille might also be an indication that the painting was finished after Memling's death

35071-montagu.jpg	Edward Wortley Montagu (1713-1776) was an English author and traveller. He was characterised by his contemporaries as playboy, dilettante, author, revolutionary, and traveler - a dysfunctional child. Romney's portrait was painted during his sojourn in Venice. It shows the influence of Titian.  Presenting a vigorous and positively war-like figure, the pose is derived from Titian's similarly exotic Portrait of Ippolito de' Medici in Hungarian costume.This portrait was part of the collection of portraits formed by the 2nd Earl of Warwick, at Warwick Castle in the late eighteenth century. For many years, it has been on loan in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, since the late 1970s

13473-anchorit.jpg	Once attributed to Mattia Preti, this canvas was subsequently given to Paolo Finoglia and then to Aniello Falcone. Judged to be one of the most effective of Falcone's works, this painting relates to the portraiture of Vel�zquez, with which it shares an emotive intensity connected to the youthful works of the Spanish master.The most interesting characteristic of The Anchorite is the tightly cropped composition of the painting, calculated to enhance the solemnity of the monk's figure. This figure, strongly located at the centre of the canvas, is foreshortened and seen as if from below. The monumentality of the whole is sustained by a strong classical-academic component, revealing Falcone's ability as a draftsman. The characterization of the face is strong in a different way: an intense study from life and perhaps even a portrait, it has a certain crude realism in its details. Falcone lays down his paint with a dense impasto and incredible rapidity of execution: nonetheless the painting is rendered noble and authoritative by the deep classicism of the painter, who seems in this case to be referring to the style that Mattia Preti brought with him to Naples after his Roman experience

37914-nicholas.jpg	Steen painted at least six pictures of the Feast of St Nicholas, the festival traditionally dedicated to Dutch children. On the eve of 5 December, St Nicholas comes to the Netherlands from Spain to leave appropriate gifts in the shoes of children. The good ones receive cakes, sweets, and toys; the naughty ones get canes and coals. The finest version of this theme is in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.A complicated play of diagonals helps bind the family of ten together - from the heap of special pastries to the man pointing to the chimney on the right, where St Nicholas made his entry, and from the carved table covered with sweets up to the girl holding the shoe with the distressing birch-rod. Figures which lean in one direction are balanced by those leaning in the other; foreground and background, right and left are held together by gestures, glances, and expressions which give the painting familial as well as pictorial tautness. The smiling boy who points to the shoe makes the onlooker part of this family scene by smiling directly out at him or her. The colouristic effect is brilliant, and does not lack unification or become too diffuse, as is sometimes the case in Steen's work

26243-ferdinan.jpg	Mengs spent his last 15 years in Spain where he became the favourite painter of King Charles III. The king commissioned the artist to execute the frescoes of the new Royal Palace and to portray the important persons belonging to the Court.Ferdinand I (1751-1825) king of the Two Sicilies (1816-25) who earlier (1759-1806), as Ferdinand IV of Naples, led his kingdom in its fight against the French Revolution and its liberal ideas. A relatively weak and somewhat inept ruler, he was greatly influenced by his wife, Maria Carolina of Austria, who furthered the policy of her favourite adviser, the Englishman Sir John Acton.Ferdinand became king of Naples as a boy when his father ascended the Spanish throne (1759) as Charles III. A regency ruled during Ferdinand's minority and continued the liberal reforms of the previous king. In 1767 Ferdinand reached his majority, and his marriage in 1768 to Maria Carolina signalled a reversal of this policy. The birth of a male heir gave Maria Carolina the right, according to the marriage contract, to enter the council of state (1777). She brought about the downfall of the former regent Bernardo Tanucci and engaged Naples in the Austro-English coalition against the French Revolution in 1793.Ferdinand, encouraged by the arrival of the British fleet of Admiral Horatio Nelson, attacked the French-supported Roman republic in 1798. On December 21 of that year, however, the French invaded Naples, declaring it the Parthenopean Republic, and Ferdinand fled to Sicily. The Republic was overthrown in June 1799, and Ferdinand returned to Naples, where he put to death the Republic's supporters, violating the terms of their surrender.In 1806 Napoleon's army captured Naples, forcing Ferdinand's flight to Sicily, where, yielding to British pressure to mitigate his absolutist rule, he removed Maria Carolina from the court, appointed his son Francis as regent, and granted the Sicilians a constitution. With the fall of Napoleon, he returned to Naples as Ferdinand I of the united kingdom of the Two Sicilies (December 1816). His renewal of absolute rule led to the constitutionalist uprising of 1820, which forced Ferdinand to grant a constitution. Having ceded power again to his son Francis, Ferdinand, under the pretext of protecting the new constitution, obtained his parliament's permission to attend the Congress of Laibach early in 1821. Once there, he won the aid of Austria, which overthrew Naples' constitutional government in March. The subsequent reprisals against the constitutionalists were his last important official acts before his sudden death

16483-40maesta.jpg	"The attribution of the large painting of the Madonna from the Florentine church of the Ognissanti (All Saints), now housed in the Uffizi Gallery, derives from a written notice from the early 15th century. The panel, described as the Ognissanti Madonna after the church in which it was originally installed, has the same strength of representation as the frescoes at Padua, and is therefore dated by art historians as having being painted in the first decade of the l4th century.From the moment we look at the wooden panel painted in tempera we are fascinated by the gleaming solemnity of the paintwork. A fine web of golden edgings on the robes, of halos, and of decorative elements blends the golden hue of the background with the representation as a whole. Both the delicate shades of violet and pink, the warm green and red, and the flesh colours of the figures thus take on a brilliant luster, which allows the panel to shine with incomparable splendour.Giotto turns to a type of picture known as the Maest&#224; - the Madonna surrounded by saints and angels - which is especially well-known because of the Maest&#224; by Duccio, begun in 1308, the one-time altarpiece of the cathedral at Siena, and through the great fresco in the Sienese Town Hall, completed by Simone Martini in 1315. These two examples of mature Sienese art have a relatively wide format: the numerous saints kneel and stand in rows to the left and right of the Virgin's throne. There they could be said to lead a ""life of their own"" &#151; some look into the centre of the picture, others look at one another, and yet others direct their gaze out of the picture. Giotto's panel, on the other hand, is vertical in format and thus approaches the size and proportions of an older type of portrayal of the Madonna. This aspect is made particularly clear in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, where the Ognissanti Madonna is exhibited next to Duccio's Rucellai Madonna and the Madonna S. Trinit&#224; by Cimabue, both of which were executed in the 1280s.This representation of the Maesta, with its novel conception of the subject and its delicate style of painting, worked through with gold, numbers among the high points in Giotto's panel painting. Here, the natural portrayal and the solemnity of the mother and child are intensified in a special way. The clear perspectival composition, in which the clearly directed gaze of the surrounding figures is included, makes the Child's gesture of benediction appear as the focal point, both optically and as regards content.Restored in 199"

23572-olddozin.jpg	This domestic scene - a superb example of the Dutch genre tableau - also has, though less obviously for a modern viewer, a moralising purpose as an allegory of sloth or laziness. An old woman has fallen asleep while reading. In her heavily veined right hand, resting on an open book on her lap, she holds a pair of reading glasses. Here the artist not only depicts tellingly a universally recognisable scene of human behaviour. Using pictorial language which would have been immediately understood by a 17th century Calvinist, he expresses, via a number of objects in the room, a jjudgment - and a highly negative one at that - about this behaviour. This verdict contrasts sharply with the positive feelings of modern viewers, who are inclined to project their emotion or tenderness into the artist's intentions when looking at his model. In particularly older viewers, who will soon be called to give a reckoning of their deeds at the Last Judgment, are sharply reminded of the severe punishments that await them after their death if they forsake their daily duties. A key on the wall points revealingly to a page in an open Bible on the table, where the name of Amos, a prophet of doom, is clearly readable. An hourglass in which time is passing props up the heavy book. Neither age nor tiredness, following on a spiritual effort, can excuse the capitulation to a human weakness. The call to be constantly awake and vigilant is directed not only at the spiritual individual but also at citizens in their daily activities.On the corner of the red cloth-covered table, a lace cushion, with light falling onto it, draws our eye. This symbol of domestic industry has been pushed aside by the woman. This deeper meaning was repeated and supplemented in other paintings with similar motifs from the same period, Experts date this early work, in which Rembrandt's influence can be clearly felt, at around 1656

26683-10_4pe4.jpg	The scenes painted in the pendentives at the sides of prophet Jonah are characterized by the use of pronounced foreshortening. This is the case with the tangled group of Israelites who, in the scene of the Brazen Serpent, writhe in the throes of death, and, above all, with the crucified figure of Haman in the Punishment of Haman.In the Brazen Serpent, the mass of bodies poisoned by the snakes occupies the whole of the right part, spreading toward the center. The survivors are grouped on the left, eyes and arms turned imploringly toward the salvafic image of the brazen serpent. The cruel punishment of the Israelites for having spoken against God and Moses occupies a large part of the pendentive, with bodies intertwined in an indescribable tangle. This presented the artist with an opportunity for virtuosic foreshortening and twisting of the bodies, and also depicting contorted, screaming faces. Much admired by Vasari, the group is a striking forerunner of the spectacular motifs that were, in the following decades, typical of the current of Mannerism comprising Giulio Romano and Vasari himself.The Biblical story (Num. 21 :4-9)The Israelites, discontented with life in the desert, spoke out against God and Moses. They were punished with a plague of poisonous snakes which only increased their hardships. Many died of snakebite. When the people repented, Moses sought God's advice how they should be rid of the snakes. He was told to make an image of one and set it on a pole. Whoever was bitten would be cured when he looked upon the image. Moses accordingly made a serpent of brass on a tau-shaped (T) pole, which proved to have a miraculous curative effect.Representation in ArtThe Israelites are depicted writhing on the ground, their limbs entwined by snakes. Moses, sometimes with Aaron, stands beside the brazen serpent. John's gospel furnishes the typological parallel: 'This Son of Man must be lifted up as the serpent was lifted up by Moses in the wilderness.' Medieval art juxtaposed the subject with the serpent in the Garden of Eden entwining the Tree of Knowledge. Both probably derive from an ancient and widespread fertility image, the 'asherah', associated with the worship of Astarte, which consisted of a snake and a tree representing respectively the male and female elements. King Hezekiah destroyed the asherah, by inference the one made by Moses, at a time when the Israelites were relapsing into idolatry (II Kings 18:4).The presence and the identification of Moses in Michelangelo's fresco is debated

The paintings represent the life-size figures of Adam and Eve from the scene of the Fall. They appear to have belonged to a series consisting of four nudes, and it is recorded that in 1641 four paintings by Hans Baldung, representing Adam, Eve, Judith and Venus, found their way from Strasbourg into the possession of a Basel merchant. The full-length Judith, now in the Germanisches Museum in Nuremberg, and the Venus in the Kroller-Muller Museum at Otterlo are panels of the same structure and dimensions as the pictures in Budapest and, since the former is dated 1524, it may be assumed that the whole series, including the two pictures in Budapest, was painted in that year.The artist created a strong contrast between the figures Adam and Eve.

00584-07passi0.jpg	"The influence of Domenico Veneziano's painting is strong in the decoration of the refectory of Sant'Apollonia which Andrea painted between June and October 1447. He solved the problem posed by the height of the refectory walls in Sant'Apollonia by using the old method of arranging the scenes in two rows, one above the other, but he gave them a visual unity: the Stories of Christ's Passion frescoed on the upper level are in fact conceived as taking place in a space behind the room where the Last Supper on the lower level is happening. The three scenes from the Passion (the Resurrection, Crucifixion and Entombment) are connected to each other by a group of flying angels all converging towards the figure of Christ in the centre, and by a common landscape background, which has been correctly judged ""the most powerful interpretation, of the Tuscan landscape in the entire history of painting"" (Berti).The scene that has been most highly praised, and which is probably the best preserved, is the Resurrection, originally the first to the left"

11503-roadwood.jpg	Diaz de la Pe&#241;a painted genre scenes in the spirit of the late Rococo, biblical compositions, and scenes from Eastern life, among other subjects. But his talent manifested itself most fully in the landscapes he created while associated with artists of the Barbizon school. Th�odore Rousseau taught him to paint great sturdy trees, although Diaz's manner seems more reconciled and even charmingly naive

19841-08erasmu.jpg	Of Holbein's portraits of Erasmus, this is the most ostentatious, and not just because it is much larger. The background of the interior is furnished with a splendidly decorated pilaster and a shelf with books and a glass carafe, all of which help to ennoble the sitter. On the edge of the book reclining on the shelf is a Latin couplet composed by Erasmus, which asserts that Holbein would sooner have a slanderer than an imitator. That seems to mean that his outstanding art could scarcely be imitated and therefore criticism from the envious is more likely than imitation.The painting is on loan from Longford Castle collection.In the Web Gallery of Art you can view several portraits of Erasmus by Renaissance painters, such as Hans Holbein the Younger, Albrecht D�rer and Quentin Massys

14936-6pould06.jpg	In October 1889, Gauguin settled in Marie Henry's inn at Le Pouldu, an isolated village in Brittany. One after the other, he produced such works as The Yellow Christ, The Green Christ or The Calvary, La Belle Ang�le. These works showed that he was in full possession of his art, with an equally masterful control of vision, plastic form, and technique.Toward the end of his stay in Brittany, in 1889, the ancient Breton calvaries gave a soul to Gauguin's emerging style and to a form which would have drifted otherwise toward Art Nouveau. In the Green Christ or The Calvary, the plastic form and arrangement, which was already emerging from Naturalism, is transformed; it is struck by a religious solemnity, a perception of an unknown god.Like the statue in the Yellow Christ, the Green Christ had an identifiable source in a mossy stone calvary that Gauguin had seen at Nizon near Pont-Aven. He has again treated the impact of religious faith on the Breton woman, who crouches in the foreground in front of the deposition, a graphic blending of the real and the illusory that had already been explored in both The Vision and the Yellow Christ. Again, the counterpoise of the quotidien is suggested by expressive, apparently uninterested background figures, here a seaweed gatherer returning from the beach.The picture may be seen as a later event in Christ's Passion - the bright colours of the Yellow Christ have given way to sombre tones, as his dead body is lifted down from the cross. Again, the face is a thinly-disguised self-portrait, another in the line of works in which Gauguin has dealt with the theme of martyrdom, likening his suffering to that of Christ
