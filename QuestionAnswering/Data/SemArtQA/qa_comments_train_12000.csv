08575-3victor1.jpg	"C�zanne rented a small cottage near Bib�mus quarry to the east of Aix to make it easier for him to paint in the open air. He also rented a room in the Ch&#226;teau Noir (""black castle""), an estate halfway to the village of Le Tholonet on the way to Mont Sainte-Victoire, where he could store his painting equipment. The Ch&#226;teau Noir was in fact a reddish roughcast neo-Gothic building belonging to a coal merchant.

29195-05munkac.jpg	"In the summer of 1873 Munk�csy was invited by Baron and Baroness de Marches to their estate in Colpach. The countryside reminded the artist of this strugglesome childhood and years of apprenticeship, the humiliations he had to suffer and the poverty. All these deepen the realism in the depiction. The primal tone of the painting is dark, too. the whites are shining brightly; the tired face of the woman, her rugged hands and humble dress, and the simple commodities of her surrounding represent the hard work and her arduous life. Munk�csy has created a truly realist genre painting, it is imbued with the sadness the artist felt when he was forced to face reality and it is filed with a quiet contemplation. ""Churning Woman"" is a masterpiece; Munk�csy's artistic approach show the assimilation of Courbet's and Leibl's influence"

26737-lunettes.jpg	In the iconographic scheme of the frescoes painted by Michelangelo, the lunettes, together with the eight smaller triangular spandrels, contain the figures of the Ancestors of Christ according to the sequence of forty generations listed at the beginning of the Gospel of Saint Matthew. This also inspired the text of the motet Liber Generationis Iesu Christi by Josquin des Pr�z contained in an anthem book of the Sistine Chapel at the time of Julius II, when the artist was working in the chapel. The names of the ancestors are written in Latin capitals on a tablet placed in the centre of each lunette, at the top of the window arch, on a rectangular fictive slab, painted in dark tones with light green borders. The tablet is enclosed by its own painted bronze frame, resting on a base and consisting of half balusters at the sides; it is surmounted by a small classical female head.Following the chronological order, the first ancestors of Christ were represented in the two lunettes at the top of the wall behind the altar. Beginning with the lunette on the left, the sequence continued with the one on the right, moved to the adjacent side wall, then to the opposite one; from there it alternated between the two side walls until it reached the entrance wall, opposite the starting point. In this way, Michelangelo adopted the same distributive pattern of the sequence of the popes frescoed at the time of Sixtus IV. An exception, however, is the lunette with the tablet bearing the names of Josiah Jechoniah-Shealtiel. Although, in chronological order, this is immediately after that of Hezekiah-Manasseh-Amon, the artist placed it on the same wall, not on the opposite one. As well as allowing the first and last lunettes to be opposite each other, the change in the pattern was probably intended to give emphasis to the time when the Israelites were deported to Babylon.The generations of Christ's ancestors are represented in the eight spandrels by family groups and, in the lunettes, by groups or single figures on either side of the tablets. Due to the lack of typological elements or precise attributions and, in most cases, of iconographic precedents, it is difficult; if not impossible, to identify the figures represented. In many cases, the suggestions made are not well-founded and are lacking in credibility. In any case, the possibility that Michelangelo was attempting to provide representations of a historical character may be excluded: the theme of the lunettes and the eight smaller spandrels is the uninterrupted sequence of the generations in the long wait for the coming of the Messiah. The message is not conveyed by the individual scenes, but rather by their totality; in this sequence of human types, the artist sought above all to differentiate the expressions, the poses, and the groupings, with a preponderance of variations on certain themes, such as maternity or, for the male figures, often anguished meditation, solitude, and despondency

19131-29vanita.jpg	Although the young man holding a skull in his hand has occasionally been identified as Hamlet, this interpretation is probably incorrect. It is much more likely to be a Dutch vanitas allegory. As in corresponding still Iifes featuring the same attribute, it voices a warning, calling on the spectator to think of death, even in youth. Such an interpretation may describe the content of the painting, but it still does not touch upon the actual meaning of the image. This is to be found in the way Hals has created a variation on a theme of Utrecht Caravaggism by equipping the model, a young man, with certain props and portraying him as someone posing for a painting. It is this that is the actual event or action of the painting, and as such it is very similar to the work of the young Rembrandt, who painted himself in similar garb working at his easel.In spite of the borrowings from the Utrecht school, there are nevertheless distinct differences. The figure does not develop from the darkness towards the light, but is lit from behind. The trompe l'oeil effects, the foreshortened hand and the skull that almost seems to jut beyond the front of the pictorial plane, are all masterly devices in which illusion is less important than painterly wit

30601-1murano3.jpg	In 1696, Pellegrini embarked on the decoration of the small portego, a bedroom, and an alcove of the family villa belonging to Angelo Correr, a place of diversion and delight.

40781-nativity.jpg	The artist of this painting is referred to as Master of Salzburg.In this picture the scene of the Nativity is represented according to an apocryphal story of the Gospel: the Virgin is reclining on her bed while two midwives are on the point of giving a bath to the Infant. The woman in green is taking the Child from His mother, while the other is taking care that the bathwater is at right temperature. The bath puts an emphasis on the human aspect of the divine Child and is a hint to baptism. Joseph is seated on the right-hand side deep in thought. He holds his staff with his left hand, and is supporting his head with his right hand. The ox and the ass at the manger in the back seem to warm the straw and the small cambric kerchief with their breath.In addition to some stylistic resemblances the painting is reminiscent in other respects too of the Trebon Master's picture of the same scene. In both pictures the composition is divided by the building of the stable, with the difference that here the supports of the stable look like the frame of the scene represented, and divide the surface into two parts and not into three. In both pictures the supporting pole, emphatically placed in the foreground, separates Joseph, who views the events from the back and plays a role similar to the spectator's. In this picture too we can see birds on the roof of the stable, but they are shaped more firmly and realistically (as are the figures) than in the work of the Master of Trebon.In spite of the simplicity of the presentation and the somewhat rugged shaping of the figures with their rather large heads the susceptibility of the International Gothic style to elegance and decorative patterns evinces itself in this painting too. The elegance can be seen in the buoyant lines of the draperies, and in the Virgin's mantle, which clings to her body as if it were wet; the decorativeness in the way in which the painter has used the opportunities inherent in the rustic surroundings, and brought into harmony the pattern of the thatched roof, the mat and the fence, which are made of similar materials, and there is an additional harmonious touch in the plaited hair of one of the midwives.As in a great many other pictures of the period the ground is exceedingly steep here; compared to the figures in the foreground the stable seems to be high, on the other hand the beam underneath the roof touches the animals' heads. Although the white piece of cloth between the two midwives-in all probability a napkin, another symbol of the human nature of Jesus-looks as though it were hovering, in fact it lies on the ground. All this is not surprising, since these forms do not convey space, they are meant, first and foremost, to fill up the surface of the picture

22767-blindman.jpg	In the 1620s and 1630s, Dutch aristocrats furthered a new vogue for particular kinds of history and portrait painting, of 'pastoral' scenes involving the loves of shepherds and shepherdesses in lush, idealized landscapes.

37660-pronk.jpg	The painting depicts a 'pronk' still-life of grapes, cherries, walnuts and a peeled lemon, with oysters on a pewter plate, and a glass roemer, wine glass and gilt goblet, all on a draped table.'Pronkstilleven' is a type of still-life painting. It is a term that could be translated as 'ostentatious still-life'. These still-lifes displayed an array of luxurious possessions that reflected the lifestyle of the wealthy in seventeenth century Holland. Venetian glass, Chinese porcelain and Turkish carpets bedecked with ornamental gold and silverware were painted as status symbols, to be hung in the homes of the affluent patrons who commissioned them. However the choice of objects was not always for spectacle alone as they sometimes carried a symbolic significance. Although only the rich could afford such rare artefacts, which were usually imported from distant lands, their inclusion in a painting could be interpreted as a patriotic tribute to the prosperity of Dutch trade. The inclusion of citrus fruits alongside wine is often read as encouraging moderation in the use of alcohol, as lemon juice was added to wine to reduce its potency and for medicinal effect.The painting is signed lower left: J. van.

15226-1belisar.jpg	The story of Belisarius was that of a loyal and successful general in the service of the Byzantine emperor Justinian. He had won major victories against the Vandals, Goths and Bulgarians, but he then became implicated in political intrigues, was accused of treason and disgraced. He became an outcast and was even reduced to begging; one version of the story also said that his eyes were put out.Belisarius was G�rard's first great success. Pressured by his friends to exhibit at the Salon of 1795, the artist chose as his subject one that his master David had painted fifteen years earlier, but in a very different mood. Painted in six weeks, the Belisarius met with critical acclaim and eclipsed the paintings of his contemporaries.The present painting is a smaller version, produced in 1797 in response to the criticism of commentators on the 1795 Salon. While Belisarius was typically depicted in the act of begging, G�rard shows him standing and erect, his muscular form in sharp contrast to his guide's weakening body. The prominent helmet hanging from Belisarius's belt emphasizes the general's heroic past and underscores the injustice of his fall from favour

03466-2interio.jpg	Van Bassen developed a specialty in lavishly decorated palace interiors with elegant figures. Characteristically, the room here is box-shaped with a tile-floor and coffered ceiling lit by rows of windows along the  left wall. The general atmosphere is one of sumptuousness and luxury. Ornamental embellishments and decorative objects abound; hardly any space is left uncovered. There are elaborately carved pieces of furniture and doors, a floral frieze along the top of the walls, two colossal marble columns with composite capitals, and a sideboard with an ostentatious display of precious-metal plates and goblets on a dais beneath a canopy. With the exception of a large triptych with The Adoration of the Shepherds, the paintings - several landscapes and a flower painting reminiscent of those by Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder or Balthasar van der Ast - are o f a type one would expect in a well-to-do Dutch household. Similar decorative features can ben found in all of Van Bassen's palace interiors.The effect of wealth and luxury is enhanced by the elegantly dressed men and women who seem to enjoy each other's company. These staffage figures have been attributed to Esaias van de Velde (1587-1630). 28 pictures by Van Bassen with staffage by Van de Velde have been identified, all datable to the first half of the 1620s.Unlike several other palace interiors by Van Bassen, this painting seems to be an uncomplicated Merry Company scene. Whether moralizing overtones should be read into it is a matter of debate. While the figures at the table in the left background are engaged in polite conversation, the general atmosphere is one of indulgence and idle pleasure; a wine cooler, richly festooned with wines, is on the right; the dandy in the foreground, clearly inebriated, enjoys the attention of two women; and a cushion and playing cards have been tossed to the floor. The company also includes a dog, a monkey, and a parrot. It has been proposed that these animals, which frequently occur in Van Bassen's palace interiors, carry symbolic significance: among other qualities, loyalty is characteristic of the dog; vanity and lust are associated with the monkey, and an ability to imitate is a talent of the parrot

25201-artemisi.jpg	Artemisia was the wife of Mausolus, the satrap of Caria in Asia Minor. She succeeded her husband on his death in 353 B.C., and erected a great monument to his memory at Halicarnassus - hence 'mausoleum'. It was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was said that she mixed the ashes of Mausolus in liquid which she then drank, thereby making herself, observes Valerius Maximus, making of herself a living, breathing tomb. Artemisia symbolizes a widow's devotion to her husband's memory. In Renaissance painting she is depicted holding a cup or goblet.This painting, attributed to an anonymous Sienese master referred to as the Master of the Story of Griselda, was probably commissioned on the occasion of a wedding. The figures of this artist are characterized by an elongated body and almost dancing movement. The artist was influenced by Luca Signorelli who worked in Siena in this period

26123-33nopor1.jpg	In the Triptych of Benedetto Portinari the adoration of the Virgin takes place in an open loggia. Benedetto's patron saint Benedict, appears in the left wing. The wings are known to have originated in the hospice of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence, which was founded by the Portinari family. The identification of the subject as Tommaso Portinari's nephew has not been proven, but is probable. His motto DE BONO IN MELIVS appears on the rear of the portrait in a banderole wrapped around an oak stump from which a new twig springs. This is the only devotional triptych to survive intact and it suggests that the triptychs showing a husband and wife were of the same type - with three evenly sized panels folding shut over one another like a box, leaving the coat-of-arms or motto visible on the outside.The central panel of the triptych depicts the Virgin and Child in a landscape. The left wing represents St Benedict, the patron saint of the donor, while the right wing is the portrait of the donor, Benedetto di Tommaso Portinari. Both wings are in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence.

Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver.

The signature and date written on the base of panel ('Pier di Cosimo 1480') must both be addition, however, because its style points to the last years of his life, sometime in the 1510s. The design is unusual, predicated on the slanting block on which Francis and Jerome kneel, dominating thee lower middle of the panel. By virtue of the intrusion of this platform, which is to be understood as an extension of the real altar, the other four saints, Augustine, Bernard, Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure, appear as three-quarter length The upper part includes and unusually ancient and benign-looking God the Father selecting the Virgin with a rod to indicate the Immaculate Conception, while he courteously turns a tablet towards her.

16650-nativity.jpg	This panel probably shows a work produced by Giovanni di Paolo when he was already past his prime. On this picture the line of the roof of the stable slants steeply  downward to the right, and the landscape roses to the right with its tiny, improbaly small bushes and rocks, recalling fantastic turrets, and leads the eyes upward. The figure of the Madonna bent forward and the nodding St Joseph - tranquil pose - emphasize the vertical axis of the composition. This vertical axis, however, does not coincide with the median of the picture, and is not even completely vertical, but leans somewhat to the left, or in other words it stresses the asymmetry rather than the equilibrium of the composition.

18738-guard203.jpg	This splendid panorama shows us how Venice appeared to travellers arriving by boat: it presents a view of the Molo, with the Ducal Palace, the Campanile and the Library. Our gaze is led from the two columns of St. Mark and Todaro by way of the Piazzetta to San Marco and the Torre dell'Orologio. Many painters have recorded the Molo from the Bacino di San Marco (e.g. Van Wittel). Francesco Guardi, however, expanded the veduta to the right by incorporating into his composition the Riva degli Schiavoni, which lies in the extension of the Molo. The representation is dominated by the cluster of sailing boats in the foreground, which with their masts and sails serve, as it were, to screen the buildings from the observer's intrusive gaze. Curiously enough, besides a single schooner and several gondolas there are mostly fishing boats here, which one would sooner expect to see on the Lagoon outside the city than on the Bacino.Guardi produced several versions of this view. On both stylistic and topographical grounds the painting exhibited here, which may also have decorated the portego of a palazzo, can be dated between 1760 and 1765. A drawing of the view of the Molo and the Riva (in private collection) can be connected to this painting

16777-0view.jpg	The famous Sala di Psiche was decorated between 1526 and 1528. This large room was intended for entertaining, and a famous banquet was held here in 1530 in honour of Emperor Charles V during his first visit to Mantua. It was on that occasion that Marquis Federico Gonzaga was elevated to the rank of duke. The frescoes in this room illustrate Apuleius's The Golden Ass, a late-antique story that recounts Psyche's romantic adventures and the trials she endured in order to be allowed to marry Cupid. The decoration is spread across the ceiling, the lunettes, and the upper parts of the walls, and the individual scenes illuminated by a soft, nocturnal light, are represented with extreme foreshortening.Above the socle area the west and north walls, each of which is broken up by windows, open onto frameless scenes of painted grottoes and a garden nymphaeum that are filled with characters from myth. Next these scenes, there are depictions of happy couples inserted above the windows. The painted frames of these scenes correspond in each case to the bas-relief window frame.On the east and south wall, which have doors leading to the adjacent rooms of the palace, there is a continuous panoramic landscape. The fertile natural idyll of the landscape paintings has satyrs and nymphs preparing a feast for the gods. The table is decorated; the silver dishes are in place; several gods have already arrived; and others are seen in the distance. The focus of the celebration is on the wedding couple, Cupid and Psyche, who are being served on a sumptuous couch.In the lunettes and fields on the ceiling we see, through a grillwork frame, a number of Cupid and Psyche's adventures, so that their banquet is vaulted by its own prehistory. In the vault Giulio tells the beginning of the story, while the stories of Psyche's suffering are painted in the lunettes

26130-36ursu0.jpg	"The carved and gilded shrine in the form of a small church containing the relics of St Ursula is decorated with paintings on all four sides. The two lateral sides each feature three scenes from the life of St Ursula, while the two narrower ends show the saints and the 11,000 virgins, the Virgin and Child and the donors. The decoration of the shrine occupies a central position in Hans Memling's wide-ranging oeuvre and demonstrates both his outstanding qualities and his limitations as an artist. His energies are devoted above all to the portrayal of single figures in graceful poses, to the realistic observation of detail, and to an exquisite palette which is often reminiscent of miniature painting. Although Memling is a narrator, dramatic climax is foreign to his temperament even in a scene of martyrdom. He lacks depth of expression and the ability to convincingly ""stage-manage"" crowd scenes. Instead, he provides a wealth of inexhaustibly varied details which together ""add up"" into the overall composition. A comparison with Carpaccio's more or less contemporaneous treatment of the St Ursula legend is particularly illuminating.Memling was clearly familiar with Cologne at first hand, as demonstrated by his accurate portrayal of the city skyline in the background, showing the unfinished cathedral, the distinctive tower of Great St Martin's church and, on the left, the church of St Cunibert.Dirk De Vos, the leading modern expert on Memling, has related how thoroughly the artist researched this work, visiting the places that he was to paint in order to get the buildings exactly right. The Rhine itself acts as a unifying thread running through the different episodes in the cycle. ""On one side of the reliquary"", writes De Vos, ""the ships are coming from the north, and cast anchor on the left bank, so that the town is on their right. On the other side, the ships are sailing towards the north, running along the right bank as they advance downstream, and thus the city is to their left. Everything is so finely observed, that one can reconstruct the angle from which the artist viewed the city with great precision, proof that Memling really did make drawings from the viewpoints he had chosen for his pictures of the ships at rest on both legs of their journey.""' Rarely has an artist gone further in the pursuit of pictorial truth, a feat that is all the more astonishing given the very small size of the pictures"

The Gothic church, ruined or decayed, acquired a particular meaning for him, as did the German forest. When in 1814 he celebrated the expulsion of the French, it was with The Chasseur in the Forest, a haunting image of a solitary French dragoon lost in a wood of evergreens.

26518-1doniton.jpg	Michelangelo probably realized this famous picture about 1506, on the  occasion of the birth of Agnolo Doni and Maddalena Strozzi's first daughter. (Few years before Raffaello had painted the portraits of Agnolo Doni and his wife, now conserved at Palatina Gallery in Florence).Highly significant of the artist's style, the group with the Virgin, Saint Joseph and the Child shows the peculiar twisting of the limbs and the evidence given to body's muscles, a pattern that clearly appears in michelangiolesque sculpture. Brightness of colours, lighting effects, emphasize impressiveness of the sacred figures. The nudes on the background, whose poses and gestures are all connected to classical sculptures, symbolize pagan mankind, the world before coming of Christ; on the right the little St John indicates the passage, through the baptism, from the pagan age to the christian age.Restored in 198

21768-terpsich.jpg	The Muse Terpsichore is obviously part of an extensive decoration (this panel is part of the decoration of the Cabinet of the Muses of the H�tel Lambert in Paris), but the artist made no concessions to decorative charm, and the figure conforms closely to the ideals of classical antiquity.			
16536-standar2.jpg	This work is a portable standard, meant to be mounted atop a pole and carried in public processions on important religious feast days.

04179-stillife.jpg	In the 1630s De Bergh turned from the production of kitchen still-lifes in the manner of Cornelis Jacobsz Delff to simpler and more elegant arrangements like this still-life with fruit in a Wan-li Bowl and a roemer. De Bergh was clearly aware of works by numerous specialists in this field, but his greatest debt was to Balthasar van der Ast, who lived in Delft from 1632 until his death in 1657.The painting is signed lower right: G. de Bergh

32285-13phoci1.jpg	From 1648 come the two Phocion landscapes, the Funeral of Phocion (Earl of Plymouth loan to the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff) and the Gathering of the Ashes of Phocion, now in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. Painted as a pair, both pictures are constructed exactly like a stage set. Perhaps it was because this way of creating a landscape was very theoretical that such compositions were imitated so widely; they were seen as the proper way to paint landscape - by construction rather than by observation. The scenes are of great tragedy: in one the good General Phocion has been wrongly accused by the citizens of Athens and sentenced to death, and in the other his grieving widow collects his ashes. The deep melancholy of these two pictures again indicates Poussin's determination to make the mind exercise thought rather than imagination

15092-landscap.jpg	This painting is an example of Van Geel's idiosyncratic later works, which he executed in Delft and Dordrecht. In the right foreground the scene is dominated by a solid mass of trees. Below the canopy of dense foliage a few wanderers follow a path that winds past twisted trunks into the deeper recesses of the wood. Toward the left of the picture we are allowed a glimpse into a flat landscape that recedes rapidly past a clearing with trees and a few diminutive figures in the middle ground. The division of the composition into two distinct vistas reflects the Flemish tradition of landscape painting, dating back to the end of the sixteenth century.The protagonists in this picture - as well as in many other works by Van Geel - are trees with dramatically contorted trunks and gnarled branches, in places heavily overgrown with moss and vines

30047-limbo.jpg	As a fulfillment of redemption, Christ, having broken open the gates of hell, has brought with him the pious figures of the Old Testament, holding Adam by the hand as the symbolical incorporation of the whole of humanity. Allusions to this forced invasion, a favoured incident of popular legends and mystery plays, are found even in the Divine Comedy; here it is indicated by cracked and broken stones. It is typical of medieval thinking that hell is represented as a well-guarded building of huge stones, a sort of immense fortified prison; the notions of release, heaven, enjoyment of the delights of Paradise, are conveyed by a fresh green meadow encircled by mountains and forests of fantastic shape, worthy of the imagination of a Tyrolese painter.

32908-0view.jpg	This view shows the west wall of the room with the scene Coronation of Charlemagne, and the north wall with the scene Oath of Leo III.Between 1514 and 1517 Raphael and his workshop frescoed the walls of the Stanza dell'Incendio di Borgo at Leo X's behest. The scenes depicted clearly relate to the new pope. They consist of four episodes from the history of the church during the Carolingian age, each of which has a pope named Leo. Leo X had found the theme of Leo I and Attila already present in the program of the Stanza d'Eliodoro, but he related it to himself by introducing his portrait features. This painted identification with predecessors sharing his name is one he continued in the Stanza dell'Incendio with stories of the popes Leo III and Leo IV: in each case the papal protagonist named Leo has Leo X's facial features.In the first fresco Pope Leo III is taking the oath of purification at the altar of St Peter's in 800; he did so to clear himself of false charges in front of Charlemagne and a Roman ecclesiastical assembly. The second scene shows Charlemagne subsequent coronation as emperor in St Peter's. The pope crowns the emperor; in the foreground servants bring in gifts for the pope. The last two episodes date from the time of Leo IV. In response to the people's plea the pope extinguishes by benediction a fire that was threatening the Vatican suburb Borgo. Finally, the pope defeats a fleet of Saracen pirates near Ostia; in the foreground the prisoners are presented to Leo.The base wall of the room has herm caryatids in between which sit secular rulers who served the church and papacy

As in the case of Ricci's picture, several versions of Pellegrini's composition have come down to posterity.

19382-7hayez.jpg	Hayez worked on the decoration of the interiors of the Napoleonic Wing, the building which ran between the Procuratie Vecchie and Nuove, the two long arcades of buildings which extend the length of St Mark's Square and had housed the offices and residences of some of the most important political authorities of the Venetian Republic. In the nineteenth century, when Venice was under the rule of Austria, it served as the official residence of the Habsburg Court during its frequent visits to the city, and after would become the Venetian residence of the king of Italy. Presently the building houses the Museo Correr.In Greek mythology, Tethys, daughter of Uranus and Gaia was an archaic Titaness and aquatic sea goddess, invoked in classical Greek poetry, but not venerated in cult. Tethys was both sister and wife of Oceanus. She was mother of the chief rivers of the world known to the Greeks, such as the Nile, the Alpheus, the Maeander, and about three thousand daughters called the Oceanids.Hayez's frescoes, originally on the wall of the Throne Room, were detached in 1950 and transferred to canvas, and now are exhibited in the Museo Correr

14932-6pould02.jpg	By the time he painted this work, Gauguin had exhausted the possibilities for 'savage' representations of Breton life at Pont-Aven, which was becoming increasingly commercialised. In July and August of 1889 and again in October he went to the more remote area of Le Pouldu, in an attempt to recapture the more exotic aspects of Breton life in his work. This canvas demonstrates the kind of ambivalence that he experienced at this time. The subject is as picturesque as Four Breton Women, and as such would have appealed to a Parisian audience who subscribed to the myth of the remote, archaic way of life in Brittany. At the same time, however, he has deliberately made the image more crude and less immediately appealing by grossly enlarging the children's coarse feet and giving them baleful expressions. He has also attempted to create a strong, forceful image, with the two interlinked bodies against a colourful, simplified background

44381-white_ho.jpg	Wouwerman is known above all for his battle scenes, hunting parties, stables, riding schools and army camps, in all of which horses play a leading role. Many of them show an activity being interrupted, as does this early work. The horse is being given a rest from the load it has been  carrying, for its rider has dismounted to shed a different kind of load out of sight on the right, which gives the averted gazes of the boy and the dog a slightly comical air.Wouwerman's masterly orchestration of this small scene has rightly made it one of the most popular in his oeuvre, above all because his 'hallmark' grey horse dominates the small panel with its monumental presence

00815-marco_p5.jpg	This panel was part of the altarpiece of the main altar in the monastery church of San Marco, Florence, and was originally in the middle of its predella.The centre predella panel of the San Marco altarpiece is not overtly connected to the scenes on either side of it, which show the life of Sts Cosmas and Damian, although it too is lit from the right. Instead it relates directly to the crucifixion at the base of the altarpiece which, when the predella was in situ, was immediately above it. Christ's body is supported by Nicodemus, and his hands are held and kissed by the stooping Virgin and St John. Christ has a weightless air about him, so that the three other figures appear to have to do little to support him. The winding cloth lies stretched out in a receding rectangle creating the foreground space, its folds and colour echoing the white rock. Behind lies the dark rectangular void of the tomb. The sparsity and simplicity of the composition, the firmly closed-off space and the extensive use of white in this panel, are all also found in Angelico's frescoes at San Marco.The figures here, arranged parallel with each other, with the central perspective of the shroud leading to the tomb, shows a very different idea of spatial organization from that in Rogier van der Weyden's panel of the same subject

26074-21virgi.jpg	Little attention was focused on this work until recently, despite the fact that it is a fairly well-preserved painting of high quality. It differs from the artist's other enthroned Virgins in its notably larger format, and iconographically simpler, less ornate decoration. Seated on a straight, wooden bench that stands on a bare tile floor, with no Oriental carpet, this Virgin still recalls the humble domestic atmosphere of compositions by the Master of Fl�malle and Rogier van der Weyden. The position of the Child in his mother's hands is somewhat reminiscent in type of Hugo van der Goes' little painting of the Virgin in Frankfurt (St&#228;delsches Kunstinstitut). The origins of this type are to be found in the Fl�malle circle, which means that Memling might also have been inspired by a composition of that master. We find the same tile pattern in Van der Weyden's Annunciation in the Louvre, and in the Presentation in the Temple (Washington, National Gallery of Art) by a follower of Van der Weyden, now known as the Master of the Prado Adoration. By contrast, the arcade opening onto the landscape, which lends horizontal rhythm to the composition, is a pure Memling invention. An interesting detail in the landscape is the church on the right, which could be the abbey church of Seligenstadt, Memling's birthplace. The architectural significance of the second row of small columns of a different type, which stands behind the parapet and supports a beam, is less plain. The painting might originally have had wings that shed light on this feature.The doubt that is sometimes expressed as to Memling's own execution of this painting is entirely unwarranted. It is true that the dotted contours of the oval trees in the left background are inserted rather mechanically, and the perspective of the round column bases is rather forced, but none of this is sufficient reason to attribute such a refined and daintily executed painting to the workshop

24596-st_anne6.jpg	The backs of the wings, when the triptych is closed, juxtapose two scenes. The first takes place beneath the portico of a church, the double arch of which gives onto a square, at the far end of which can be seen the tower of Antwerp cathedral. Under the portico, the High Priest of Jerusalem is receiving an ebony casket from St Anne, who lowers her eyes. Behind her, Joachim holds a parchment which contains the act of donation to the temple and its ministers. In the distance are two figures seen from behind: these too are Anne and Joachim, distributing money to the poor.In the second scene, Joachim's face and attitude express his distress and confusion: the High Priest has refused the coins Joachim has just placed on the offering table, and is gesturing to him brusquely to leave.Massys may sometimes tend towards mawkishness in his treatment of these themes, but St Anne was a particularly popular legend in Flanders and Holland, and this painting brought him immediate and considerable success

12479-08electo.jpg	Frederick III (1463-1525), known as Frederick the Wise, had became Elector of Saxony in 1486 and was one of the princes entitled to select the Holy Roman Emperor. He later became D�rer's first major patron. This portrait was probably done when Frederick the Wise visited Nuremberg from 14-18 April 1496. D�rer used quick-drying tempera paint, rather than oil paint, and this may have been so that the picture could be taken away. Frederick the Wise, then 33, is depicted from the waist up, elegantly dressed and set against a light-green background. His folded arms rest on a ledge and in his left hand he holds a small scroll. The monarch's slight frown is probably intended to convey fortitude. The most striking aspect of the portrait are Frederick's piercing eyes, staring straight at the viewer.Frederick the Wise must have been pleased with this portrait as D�rer was then commissioned to paint a series of important altarpieces for the church at the Elector's palace in Wittenberg. D�rer sketched Frederick the Wise 27 years later as an elderly statesman and the following year the drawing was used for an engraving

18348-1413grec.jpg	The sitter, Antonio de Covarrubias y Leiva (1524-1602) was the son of a Toledan architect, the master of works at Toledo Cathedral, who also designed the fa�ade of the Alc�zar in the city. Antonio studied law at the University of Salamanca. He became a noted jurist, antiquarian, philosopher, poet, humanist and Hellenist. He was ordained in 1581 and made a canon of Toledo Cathedral. It was about this time that El Greco met Covarrubias. The two men felt at ease with each other, possibly speaking together in Greek. As a tribute to his friend, El Greco included Covarrubias in his Burial of the Count of Orgaz, where he is seen in profile towards the right.In this austere yet sensitive representation El Greco demonstrates his skill as a portraitist. The sitter's black costume contrasts with his white beard and the light flesh tones of his face. He seems lost in thoughts, his watery eyes looking into the void. The portrait was probably painted around 1600, when Covarrubias had become completely deaf.Soon afterwards El Greco produced a copy of the portrait, which he paired with a posthumous portrait of Antonio's brother Diego de Covarrubias, a distinguished canonist and adviser to Philip II. These paintings are now in the Museo de El Greco in Toledo

42201-0101vela.jpg	The Breakfast is among Vel�zquez's earliest bodegones, painted shortly before the end of his apprenticeship, in 1617 or at the very beginning of 1618. It concentrates with particular intensity on the individual characterization of the men, who are shown half-length and three-quarter length, and they are of different ages. The frugality of their meal obviously does not impair their enjoyment of life. The composition presents a view from above of their expressive faces and hands, the tablecloth, and the physical materiality of the food and drink.Vel�zquez did not paint lavish quantities of victuals, but the frugal diet of simple people: there is garlic on tables in his bodegones, with fish and eggs, black pudding, olives and aubergines, cheese, home-made wine and a few fruits, together with kitchen utensils such as a mortar, a bowl or a pottery jug. These Spartan still-lifes and the realistically depicted characters shown in such settings, people with an aura of grave silence even when they are painted in action, convey a sense of self-sufficiency that seems to emanate from the down-to-earth philosophy of the ordinary man in the street.There is another version of this painting entitled Peasants at the Table in the Sz�pm�v�szeti M�zeum, Budapest

33494-01portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 70.This portrait, together with two other Dutch pictures, was apparently given to Charles I by Sir Robert Kerr (1578-1654), presumably before 1633 when he was created Earl of Ancrum. It is possible that Kerr obtained the paintings while in Amsterdam on a diplomatic mission to express the king's condolences to the King and Queen of Bohemia on the death of their eldest son, Frederick Henry, who drowned in January 1629.Technical examination of the present work has revealed that Rembrandt reused a panel on which he had previously made a study of an old man, posed the other way up. This may have been intended as an evangelist with an attribute placed in the lower right (currently upper left) corner. The positioning of the head in the finished portrait is asymmetrical, which suggests that the panel has been cut down unevenly.The same sitter appears in a number of early paintings by Rembrandt as well as in several etchings and a drawing, none of which is dated. In most of these the figure wears a hood. There is, however, no firm corroborative evidence for an identification with the artist's mother, Neeltge Willemsdr. van Suytbrouck (1568-1640). She was the daughter of a baker and married Harmen Gerritsz. van Rijn, a miller, in 1589. Of the eight children from the marriage Rembrandt was the seventh.Possibly the figure in this and the related works is too elderly to be a true depiction of the artist's mother, then aged sixty. Consequently, it has been argued that it is not so much a traditional portrait as a specific subject, such as a prophetess in the biblical sense. Significantly, the same figure is depicted by Gerrit Dou, who joined Rembrandt's studio as a pupil in 1628. On stylistic grounds, notably the small neat brushstrokes depicting the wrinkled skin and the even tonality, the date implied by its acquisition in Amsterdam by Sir Robert Kerr in 1629 is acceptable. Some writers, however, ignore that sequence of events, suggesting a date of around 1630/1, in which case the provenance has to be rethought. Yet others prefer an attribution to Rembrandt's studio companion, Lievens

21400-judith.jpg	Of the pupils of Piazzetta, Giulia Lama was certainly the one who showed the finest artistic temperament. She took her teacher's early period severity of colour and chiaroscuro and accentuated them in interpretations of vibrantly dramatic quality. In 'Judith and Holofernes' the moment preceding the bloody event is charged with expressionistic accents through the violent effect with which the sudden aggressive light evokes the supine body of Holofernes, the figure of Judith intent in propitiary prayer and the figure of the old serving woman almost wholly enveloped in shadows. Such calculated and skilful scenic arrangement as seen in the foreshortening of the figures and the masterly control over the light, create an effect which is definitely not naturalistic but which aims rather at pleasing melodramatic intensity.

23855-3manet14.jpg	Manet's special friendship with Monet, and his new desire to paint from nature, came together in the picture The Monet Family in Their Garden. Monet recounted what happened that day in his Argenteuil garden. Renoir appeared, and, attracted by the atmosphere, decided to paint the same subject, Camille Monet and her Son in Their Garden. It is interesting to compare the two works painted that day. We see that, though influenced by his juniors, Manet remained Manet. His painting seems both more carefully thought out and more ambitious than Renoir's, and, though he breaks new ground in his brushstrokes and variety of colours, he remains allusive, lacking the spontaneity shown by Renoir. But then, Renoir was practiced at this kind of painting, whereas Manet was the beginner

17100-1arles12.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 410, JH 1426.In his Dutch years van Gogh had employed a tonal palette typical of the Barbizon painters and some of the Hague School artists. But in 1884-85 he encountered a new theory of colour in the books and articles he was reading about the French painter Delacroix. From these texts van Gogh derived the thesis that one of the distinguishing features and great discoveries of recent art that made it 'modern' was the use of complementary and contrasting colours in place of tonality and chiaroscuro. The basic message of his reading was that each primary colour - red, blue, yellow - has a complementary colour composed of a mixture of the other two. The complement of red is green; of blue, orange; of yellow, violet. Shadows cast by an object should include the complementary colour of the object. Complementaries are also used to heighten and intensify the brilliance of colour. In his ambition to be modern van Gogh adopted these theories, but without a sophisticated understanding of them or a sound technical foundation as a painter. He applied them crudely and programmatically, though often with unexpectedly powerful and original effects.During the spring and summer of 1888 van Gogh corresponded regularly with �mile Bernard, giving his friend reports on work in progress and describing his colour experiments such as this still-life. The complementary pairs of blue and orange, yellow and violet can be easily recognized in this painting, and from the colour notes added to a sketch of it included in a letter to Bernard it is clear that the red-green pair was also employed

The woman in front has a quiver slung over her shoulder and displays the trophy, a hare, which she holds by the ears. Some of Diana's attendants are bathing; others have emerged from the water and are putting on their robes. The one who stands out most is the naked woman in the right foreground holding a garment over her head and contemplating the observer.Although the painting ostensibly illustrates a mythological tale, it is in fact an idyllic parade of nude or semi-nude women in a variety of poses, which evokes a classicist mood reminiscent of the French masters Poussin and Claude Lorrain

13834-anthony.jpg	The Scuola del Santo in Padua, the house where the brotherhood of St Anthony met, was on the edge of the square in front of the church in which the famous Franciscan saint was buried. This lay confraternity united mainly traders, merchants and artisans who assembled for regular services and mutual social welfare. The Sala Capitolare served for the meetings of the male members, and the older room on the ground floor was allocated to the women. A lavish decoration of the upper hall was begun in 1508 with painted ornaments on the coffered ceiling. At the same time they added wood paneling, armoires, and benches that covered the lower part of the walls. The remaining surface of the walls above this was divided into fields by wooden pilasters, and beginning in 1509it was frescoed by various painters - in the tradition of the older 'scuola' decorations in Venice and Padua. Within a few years a cycle of at least twelve episodes from the life and work of St Anthony had been completed.The painters of the fresco decoration were Giovanni Antonio Requesta (known as Corona), Filippo da Verona, Tiziano Vecellio, Francesco Vecellio, Girolamo Tessari (known as Girolamo del Santo), Bartolomeo Montagna, and Domenico Campagnola. The room owes its fame in the history of Italian art to three of the paintings: the frescoes Titian produced for the brotherhood in 1511.Scenes with St Anthony are found on all four walls of the room. The history cycle paintings immediately to the left and right of the altar on the altar wall show Anthony using his eloquence for the well-being of Padua. In the left fresco he is seen soon after his arrival in Padua, preaching to establish peace among the citizens of the city; in the right painting he is calming and converting the tyrant Ezzelino, who represented a threat to Padua from outside. These frescoes were executed by Corona.To the left of the altar wall, on the long entrance wall, follows a series of miraculous cures by Anthony. The scenes are: The Miracle of the Jealous Husband (Titian); The Healing of the Wrathful Son (Titian); St Anthony Heals a Child who Has Fallen into Boiling Water (Girolamo del Santo, divided into two by the window); Resurrection of a Murdered Man (Bartolomeo Montagna); The Death of St Anthony (18th-century addition); Resurrection of a Drowned Girl (Domenico Campagnola); Resurrection of a Drowned Child (Domenico Campagnola).The end wall (opposite to the altar wall) shows the saint's three most famous miracles: The Miracle of the Newborn Child (Titian); The Miracle of the Miser's Heart (Francesco Vecellio); The Miracle of the Host (Francesco Vecellio).The right wall to the altar (the second long wall) depicts, between three windows, four events that took place only after the saint's death: St Anthony Appears to the Blessed Luca Belludi (Filippo da Verona); The Death of St Anthony (Girolamo del Santo); Recovery of the Relic of St Anthony's Jawbone (Bartolomeo Montagna); Miracle of the Glass (Girolamo del Santo).The picture shows Filippo da Verona's painting on the second long wall. In this scene Anthony appears to the Blessed Luca Belludi to announce during the siege of Padua that the city would soon be liberated from the tyranny of Ezzelino

04681-venus_ad.jpg	The subject of the painting is taken from Ovid and illustrates the moment that the goddess, begging Adonis not to leave her for the hunt, knowing that he will never return, entreats a kiss from her reluctant and very mortal lover.The picture illustrates Blanchard's mastery of texture, both in drapery, and flesh tones. Here we see the painter's great admiration of and debt to his Venetian experience: the strongly baroque rhythm of interlocking limbs is characteristic of the Venetian school, but was achieved by only a few northern artists, Rubens being the most successful in this regard. It is interesting to note how similar Blanchard's Venus and Adonis is to Rubens's painting of the same subject, which he, in turn had based on Titian's picture in the Prado

05095-borromeo.jpg	Borgianni's altarpiece for San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane, the church of the Discalced Trinitarians, was probably already installed when the building was consecrated on 2 June 1612. At that time, the order's two founders, Felix de Valois and Jean de Matha, had not yet been canonised. They could only be worshiped in public after 1666, once the process had been completed. This did not mean, however, that a cult could not develop around them earlier. The order, established for the express purpose of buying the freedom of Christian slaves, was consecrated to the Holy Trinity. One of the most important 'new' saints of the period was Carlo Borromeo, who had been canonised in 1610. Borromeo came from Milan, which was then under Spanish rule. The Trinitarians, too, had close ties with Spain, and between 1598 and 1606 Borgianni himself had spent time in Pamplona, Madrid, Valladolid and Toledo. It is therefore not at all surprising that the commission for the recently finished church went to him, and that the church itself was not only dedicated to the Holy Trinity but to this new saint as well.In the altarpiece Carlo Borromeo is seen in full length, his left hand at his breast and his other open, pointing downwards. The Holy Trinity is depicted at the upper left. This combination might seem surprising. Although Carlo Borromeo was particularly devoted to the Passion, in Borgianni's painting he is presented as a true devotee of the Trinity, which in this context is understandable. The saint clearly demonstrates that his devotion is affective and that it comes directly from a pious heart. He is an example for all the Trinitarian brothers living in the monastery to imitate. Moreover, the altarpiece signaled the political leanings of the order towards the Spanish-Lombard faction. Remarkably enough the Trinitarians did exactly the same as the Barnabites who in their San Carlo ai Catinari used the image of Carlo Borromeo to show their spiritual affiliations.In 1614 the saint's heart was triumphantly brought to the church of Santi Carlo e Ambrogio al Corso. This intensified the cult around the great Milanese cardinal, which now centred on his mystically inspired, secular charity. The saint's gesture in Borgianni's altarpiece is a conscious reference to this new, modernised cult. The order's propagandistic aims and the desire for a public avowal of their particular brand of spirituality thus determine the look of Borgianni's painting

22759-apollo.jpg	The early training of Jan Lys (Giovanni Liss in Italy) took place in Amsterdam under Hendrik Goltzius who painted very much in the style of the Italian Mannerists. After attending school in Haarlem, he spent two years in Rome as part of the circle of Flemish artists linked by their admiration of Caravaggio. In 1624 he moved to Venice. All his artistic means, which had once been brilliant and sensual, were now aiming for an effect of hazy vagueness and already seemed to offer a foretaste of the Rococo age. A good example from the very limited output of Lys is Apollo and Marsyas where the cruel event of the Greek mythological subject fades into a feeling of silent, panic-stricken excitement

42813-1resurre.jpg	The subject of this painting, in a relatively small format, is the resurrection of Christ, which occurred in a miraculous manner, despite the sealed tomb and the presence of guards watching over it, on the third day after his crucifixion. The Saviour, who bears the stigmata of the Passion, floats upwards from the tomb with outstretched arms and his gaze directed heavenwards. Veronese visualises the miracle by means of the fiercely gesticulating soldiers, who respond with signs of fear and horror. In the background to the right the artist depicts a later scene, with a repetition of the tomb: the arrival of the women in the morning to anoint Christ's body. They found the sepulchre empty; an angel was there to tell them what had occurred on that first Easter Day.Veronese took as his guide an altarpiece by Titian dating from 1522. The Titian largely dictated the asymmetry in Veronese's painting, but he increased the elegance and tightness of his composition by including a number of overlaps between the different spatial layers and figures, and by the addition of the ruins on the left

12593-5_4holy.jpg	"D�rer did not paint these four paintings on commission. It was he who wanted to donate them to Nuremberg, his native city. On 6 October 1526 the artist offered The Four Holy Men to the city fathers of Nuremberg: `I have been intending, for a long time past, to show my respect for your excellencies by the presentation of some humble picture of mine as a remembrance; but I have been prevented from so doing by the imperfection and insignificance of my works... Now, however, that I have just painted a panel upon which I have bestowed more trouble than on any other painting, I considered none more worthy to keep it as a memorial than your excellencies.' As it was common in many cities in Italy to bestow the town hall with a work of art that would serve as an example of buon governo, so did D�rer want to provide his native city with a work of his that had been purposefully made to this end.The council gratefully accepted the gift, hanging the two works in the upper government chamber of the city hall. D�rer was awarded an honorarium of 100 florins. The four monumental figures remained in the municipality of Nuremberg until 1627, when, following threats of repression, they had to be sold to the elector of Bavaria, Maximilian I, a great enthusiast of D�rer's work. On that occasion, however, the prince had the inscriptions, at the bottom of the paintings, sawed off and sent back to Nuremberg, as they were considered heretical and injurious to his position as the sovereign Catholic. The city handed them over to the museum in Munich in 1922, where they were rejoined with their respective panels.Despite the presence of the Evangelist Mark, the pair of panels with their slightly larger than life-size figures have since the 1530s usually been called `The Four Apostles', although The Four Holy Men is a more accurate title. John the Evangelist stands on the far left, holding an open New Testament from which he is reading the first verses of his Gospel. Behind him is the figure of Peter, holding the golden key to the gate of heaven. On the other panel, standing at the back, is the Evangelist Mark, with a scroll. On the far right is Paul, holding a closed Bible and leaning on the sword - a reference to his subsequent execution.The Four Apostles, witnesses to the faith, were to simultaneously function as a warning. For this, their figures had inscriptions affixed that the calligrapher Johann Neud�rfer had added to the bottom of the panels, which reproduced biblical passages from the recent translation of Martin Luther (1522). The first line of both are references to the Apocalypse of St John (22:18 ff.), but the essential content has another origin: it is a reproach to the secular powers not to conceal the divine word in seductive human interpretation. Besides, it reads that everyone should take the warning of the ""four excellent men"" to heart: almost a formulation of the symbolic program represented in the choice of the four figures, of three apostles and an evangelist, Mark, an unusual choice that D�rer does not explain or illustrate.The Four Apostles undoubtedly represents his personal religious credo through the inscriptions. His position is to be on guard against the ""false prophets."" This becomes understandable if one considers the political-religious background of that time and the violence and passion of the religious upheavals, which favoured the onset of false doctrines. D�rer knew that his support of the Lutheran movement, which surely came out from the words of the inscriptions, would have been shared by important and influential citizens; in fact, different from the majority of Nuremberg sovereignties, firmly embraced Protestantism in toto.In his Bulletin on the Artists and Artisans in Nuremberg of 1546, the aforementioned Neud�rfer writes that D�rer wanted to represent a sanguine, a choleric, a phlegmatic, and a melancholic. It is possible to subdivide them according to the following attributions: John would be the sanguine, Peter the phlegmatic, Paul the melancholic, and Marco the choleric. In addition, each temperament would correspond to one of the four ages of life. Preparatory drawings exist for the heads in Berlin and Bayonne .Although some scholars had believed that the two figures at the back of the pictures, Peter and Mark, had been added later by D�rer, a technical analysis in the 1960s showed that the paintings had originally been conceived with the four men. This examination also confirmed that they were made as a pair, not as wings of a triptych.These are D�rer's last known oil paintings, done when he was 55. They represent his spiritual testimony and are among his most powerful works"

39263-4lastju.jpg	In the years when Veronese was producing his monumental banqueting scenes, Tintoretto also painted some large scale works: the Adoration of the Golden Calf and the Last Judgment in the presbytery of Madonna dell'Orto are both almost fifteen meters high. The difference between the painters is evident. Veronese's works are brilliantly variegated, but Tintoretto deliberately dispenses with harmony and composure. Instead he favours a glaring, sultry light, in which the tense postures of the figures and the strained perspective are used for expressive effect.Tintoretto's Last Judgment is a systematic summary of Titian's and Michelangelo's great models in a judgment that resembles a flood. The height of the painting and a skilful manipulation of the point of view enable the artist to create the illusion that the slanting cosmic deluge is pouring over to the viewer.Iconographically, this is probably Tintoretto's most complex painting, and it has still not been fully interpreted. The artist shows the Last Judgment as a raging elemental event of cosmic dimensions. If, as is often claimed, Tintoretto ever strove to achieve a synthesis of Titian and Michelangelo, then it was here, where he combines the composition of the Gloria of 1553 for Charles V with the monumentality of the wall painting of the Sistine Chapel. As in late medieval northern panel painting, Christ is shown as judge of the world, with the lily of mercy and the sword of righteousness, while the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist intercede for resurrected mankind. A particularly unusual feature is the depiction of The Last Judgment as a catastrophe involving flooding

12589-1madpear.jpg	In the beginning of the eighteenth century, this painting was in the guardaroba (cloakroom) of the Pitti Palace. From there, it moved to the Villa di Poggio a Caiano. It has been at the Uffizi since 1773.This is one of D�rer's later works, and can therefore be placed at the end of the period in which the artist journeyed tirelessly from one end of Europe to the other in the incessant search for new stimuli and new knowledge. An obvious reflection of it is the remarkable change that is visible in the treatment of the forms, which in this painting are round and fully sixteenth century and arranged in the space of the composition with absolute confidence, and the complex play of complementary curves created by the movement of the arms and hands of the Child.D�rer made the pear smaller as the painting process progressed. Despite its small scale, the Madonna is depicted in a half-bust; the child is seated, though it is unclear on what - maybe the mother's arm. The artist leaves that up to the spectator.It is the last and most stylistically mature version of the Madonna's image painted by D�rer. The image of Munich from 1516, though not revealing any emotional rapport between the mother and child, like this one, is nevertheless fascinating for its iconic aspect; but the Florentine image lacks intimate and formal tension.Here, too, the Madonna is frontally depicted, holding a pear in her left hand of which we see only the fingers. And here again, the long blond hair falls on her shoulders almost symmetrically to the right and left. The necklines of the white blouse and red dress are also nearly symmetrical, contrasting with her softly curved facial features. Her downward gaze shows meditation and pensiveness. Even the gaze of the clothed child is absorbed and immobile. The right hand holds on to the edge of the mother's cloak, and the left hand's fingers close around a nondescript flower. Evidently, this devotional image also was intended for meditation on the mother of God and on the Passion and Redemption of Christ, even if until now it has not been possible to discern any connection between the pear and the flower

00119-market.jpg	Genre-painting, as an independent subject, originated in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century. Before then scenes from everyday life had often been depicted in the background of pictures with a primarily religious content, but it was only after about the middle of the sixteenth century that many painters began to feel their principal task was to represent everyday life for its own sake. With Pieter Bruegel the Elder, also called Peasant Bruegel, genre painting came to be generally accepted and found a great many adherents in the Netherlands. Pieter Aertsen, who was born in Amsterdam and worked mainly in his native city and in Antwerp, was one of the most eminent of these. Most of his works depict market vendors, scenes at fairs or kitchen interiors, with an abundance of carefully painted still-life motifs.In this painting he depicts an old Dutch peasant taking his produce to the market, on his head a heavy tub, in his right hand a brace of mallard and a basket of eggs. A peasant girl in the background kneels by a tray of pasties or loaves. The painter has achieved an effect of monumentality by using large spots of colour and clear outlines and by enclosing his powerfully modelled figures within the confines of a narrow space. Aertsen's great virtue lies in his sincerity and simplicity, particularly noticeable if we compare his work with later genre-scenes

35589-07furcoa.jpg	"In this painting the artist portrayed his second wife, Helene Fourment nude but for a fur. This was certainly his favourite among the many paintings exhibiting her undeniable charms. At all events, he refused to part with Het Pelsken. In tones worthy of Titian, he painted Helene with curly hair, her nipples erect, her nudity barely concealed by a fur wrap better suited to her husband's bulk than her own. Her expression is difficult to read: is her mutinous air intended as a provocation, or was she simply anxious to wrap herself up against the cold? Nudity as an attribute of mythological beauty, which provided its ""justification"", was by no means new, but for Rubens the unusual picture of the naked Helene is exclusively private in character. Helene is standing on a red cloth and is wrapping herself, apparently spontaneously with a white cloth and a fur cloak. She is holding both in such a way that each arm crosses in front of her body covering the pelvic region, but pushing her breasts up in the crook of her right arm. Here, together with the face, the intimate gaze of the painter is betrayed. The title Het Pelsken (""The Little Fur"") is due to Rubens himself, who described the painting thus in his will. He bequeathed it as a separate item to his wife and also stipulated expressly that it should not be offset against her official share of his estate. It was only after her death in 1658 that it passed into other hands"

24680-1visita.jpg	"No written sources have been found so far on the life of the Master M S, the most important representative of Late Gothic painting in Hungary. The only clue concerning his activity is the date 1506 and the signature M S on the sarcophagus of one of his paintings, The Resurrection of Jesus Christ, held in the Christian Museum of Esztergom. There is even uncertainty concerning the identity of the church for which his closely associated paintings were made. The most widely accepted view identifies it as the Church of Mary of Selmecb�nya, since most of the paintings were found in the vicinity of this important mining town. There are four Passion paintings in the possession of the Christian Museum; the painting ""The Birth of Christ"" is held in Hontszentantal, while The Adoration of the Magi is kept in the Museum of Lille in France. According to the earlier attempts at reconstructing the master's work now at the National Gallery, the paintings were supposed to decorate the outer panels of a large triptych when closed; when opened, the triptych was assumed to reveal reliefs, since traces of such reliefs can be found on the obverse of the Passion scenes. Recent studies by restorers cannot exclude the possibility that the scenes taken from the life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion scenes were in fact parts of two different triptychs.The painting entitled ""The Visitation"" depicts the meeting of the two saints, the Virgin Mary and St. Elizabeth, with poetic intimacy: Elizabeth recognizes Mary as the mother of God and kisses her hand. The idyllic landscape, which is in harmony with the figures, further enhances the poetic mood of the picture. The iconographic representation of the Visitation, in which the two saints meet in the open air, rather than in Elizabeth's house, first became popular in the painting and book illuminations of Netherlandish artists. The flowers iris and the peony shown in the foreground are the symbols of Mary. However, while in the paintings of Rogier van der Weyden, for example, the earlier mentioned flowers were modestly hidden in the meticulously painted grass, in Master M S's work they become the corner-stones of the composition. The representation of these flowers suggest the direct study of nature, which could have been associated with the wide spread of herbariums"

29924-p_heart.jpg	Throughout his career, Adriaen van Ostade focused almost exclusively on the depiction of peasant life. His approach to the subject developed from his sharply satirical early works indebted to Adriaen Brouwer to a more rustic, sympathetic portrayal in his later decades. The coarse chiaroscuro effects were gradually replaced by a brighter coloration, and care for detail played an increasingly important role, as can be seen in the present richly articulated work, in which various kinds of utensils add to the rural disorder. Van Ostade's most acclaimed etching, The Family of 1647, marked a watershed in this development. Its composition seems to have served as a blueprint for several of Van Ostade's  subsequent variations of such scenes, both drawn and painted.The present painting is closely related to the etching of 1647 in the layout of the interior

31223-12monte1.jpg	Shortly after the Madonna of Senigallia, Piero set to work on the most grandiose of his paintings dating from this period. This was the huge altarpiece showing the Madonna and Child with Saints, today in the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan. Probably painted for the church of the Osservanti di San Donato in Urbino, this panel was transferred, after the death of Federico in 1482, to the church of San Bernardino, the modern mausoleum built for the deceased Duke. Federico da Montefeltro, shown kneeling at the foot of the Madonna's throne, is portrayed in his warrior's armour, but without the insignia awarded to him by Pope Sixtus IV in 1475.The absence of these emblems, which Piero would certainly have included in an official portrait like this one, leads us to date the splendid Brera altarpiece, previously believed to be Piero's last work, at around 1472-74. The complex and majestic architectural background, against which the 'sacra conversazione' takes place, is clearly derived from designs very similar to the ones followed by Alberti in his construction of the church of Sant'Andrea in Mantua. Yet, at the same time, the architecture anticipates certain 'classical' elements which will be used by the young Bramante - another extraordinary artist from Urbino. In this painting, too, the artist's mastery of proportions is remarkable; it is almost symbolized by the large ostrich egg hanging from the shell in the apse. The shape of this symbolic element is echoed by the near perfect oval of the Madonna's head, placed in the absolute centre of the composition. In this painting Piero places his vanishing point at an unusually high level, more or less at the same height as the figures' hands, with the result that his sacred characters, placed in a semicircle, appear less monumental.Piero's extraordinary invention of an architectural apse echoed below by another apse, consisting in the figures of the saints gathered around the Madonna, was taken up time and again by artists working at the end of the 15th century and at the beginning of the 16th, particularly in Venice, starting with the almost contemporary paintings of Antonello da Messina and Giovanni Bellini. This organized composition, typical of Piero's work, contained within a unity of space and lighting, seems however to have a new feel about it, as though the artist were taking part in the new currents being developed in Italian art after 1470. The new trends are dictated primarily by the great popularity that Netherlandish painting was enjoying, particularly in Urbino. The most descriptive and 'miniaturistic' aspects of Netherlandish painting are echoed in the Brera altarpiece in the Duke's shining armour, for example, and in the stylised decoration of the carpet. Netherlandish art was popular among the patrons of the period as well, as we can see by the rings on Federico's hands, which Piero had painted by Pedro Berruguete, a Spaniard with a Northern training.The other aspect of this painting that must not be underestimated is its similarity with the new developments of Florentine painting, visible primarily in the work of Verrocchio and some of his young pupils. The angels' garments are decorated with jewels and with huge precious brooches, their hair is held back by elegant diadems: these elements, and even their melancholy expression, are certainly influenced by the recent developments in Florentine art. In the same way, St John the Baptist's and St Jerome's bony limbs, emaciated by deprivations in the wilderness, recall some of Verrocchio's studies; and the sleeping Child, in his extraordinary contorted position, anticipates some of the young Leonardo's drawings of putti

03805-068pesa.jpg	"The Pesaro Altarpiece, depicting the Coronation of the Virgin, is one of the artist's masterpieces and a pivotal work of his mature years. The painting does lack a precise chronological reference, and about this, and the closely linked and equally unresolved question of its commissioning, critics are particularly intransigent, arriving at controversial and far from conclusive results.The altarpiece certainly has a politico-religious value which is impressed in and in some way determines the composition. On the one hand it celebrates the profession of Franciscan faith (an Order linked to the Sforza family, then lords of Pesaro, by strong bonds of devotion and protection) through the presence, at the sides of the throne and in the left and right-hand pilasters, of saints whose cult was particularly venerated and fostered by the friars in Pesaro and in the territory of the signoria. But, on the other hand, they are particularly significant by virtue of a symbolic meaning attributed to their presence: George, the knightly saint so dear to the noble courts, and Terence, saint of Pesaro represented as an ancient ""miles"", occupy the compartments at the base of the pilasters,  where heraldic insignia were usually placed, and thus represent the civil and military power of the Sforza. Behind Terence, on the left, a Roman memorial tablet with a bust and an inscription extolling the emperor Augustus completes the celebratory reference to the 'potestas' of the ducal family.The occasion for the execution of the altarpiece is also a matter of uncertainty and controversy. It might have been ordered to celebrate the taking of Gradara, the Riminese fortress conquered by Pesaro in 1463: the many-towered and fortified landscape in the background of the Coronation would in this case refer to the representation of Gradara. Alternatively, we might consider the marriage between the lord of Pesaro and Camilla of Aragon in 1474.Stylistically, the Pesaro Altarpiece marks the achievement of a new balance. The lesson of Mantegna appears to have been sublimated in the light of that of Piero della Francesca, thus opening the way to yet another issue: where and when, in other words, had Bellini been able to contemplate and become so well acquainted with the art of Piero della Francesca. Probably the Pesaro Altarpiece itself constituted for him the occasion of a journey from Venice to the Marches, which was among other things his mother's birthplace, and therefore the possibility of a direct appreciation of the works of Piero della Francesca.The typically Venetian architecture of the altarpiece recalls that of some contemporary funerary monuments, primarily that of the Doge Pasquale Malipiero, erected by Pietro Lombardo in the church of St John and St Paul. However, the typology of a frame that is integral with the painting, in the interests of an inseparable perspective and spatial continuity, is fundamentally new (even if it drew on various precedents, such as Mantegna's San Zeno Polyptych). The idea of the throne's open back-piece, a veritable painting within a painting, serves precisely to resume and further articulate this new structural and compositional definition. In the great altarpiece that followed, that of San Giobbe (c. 1487) and in the altarpieces to come this intuition would develop and mature until it reached a total, and also optical, indivisibility of the painting from its frame, which constitutes the only real access to it, the starting point of the vision itself"

40285-lamentat.jpg	Although often included among the ranks of the followers of Caravaggio in Rome, a grouping which the nocturnal effects of the Lamentation make plausible, Turchi in fact exercised considerable independence in his choice of sources and influences. Painted in 1617, only a few years after he left his native Verona and settled in Rome, the work reveals a surprisingly strong classicising tendency, despite the use of artificial illumination and dramatic contrasts of light and shade. Part of the Caravaggesque quality here, however, is a product of two very specific elements, the use of slate as a support and the artificial illumination. Since the natural colour of the slate normally serves to produce extreme contrasts of light and shade, Turchi may have included an artificial light source to take advantage of those tendencies inherent in the support. If we put aside the strong use of an internal light source, which could have been inspired by any number of Roman or even northern Italian sources, there is no other apparent influence from such Caravaggesque painters as Gerrit van Honthorst, who specialised in nocturnal effects. Nevertheless, Turchi can hardly have failed to notice the attention the young Utrecht painter was attracting in Rome with his brilliant nocturnal effects at this very moment.Furthermore, as a northern Italian, he was certainly familiar with the various nocturnal scenes popularised by the Bassano family. When it came to the rendering of the figures, however, it is to Annibale Carracci's famous c. 1600 Piet&#224; (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples) that Turchi turned. In 1617 this famous painting, made for Cardinal Odoardo Farnese, was still in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. From this important and unusually lovely canvas by Annibale, Turchi borrowed the idealised pose and classical rendering of the body of his dead Christ. This strongly classicising quality probably accounts for the later attribution of the picture to Annibale himself in the 1700 inventory of the Borghese collection

14324-02view.jpg	The picture shows a view looking toward the altar wall and the north wall with scenes 1-5 of the St Cecilia cycle. The cycle begins to the left of the altar.St Cecilia is one of the most famous Roman saints, although she is purely legendary. She is meant to have lived in the second or more probably the third century, but only appears in the tradition in the fifth and sixth centuries. A young girl of noble background, she was betrothed, in spite  of her vow of chastity, to a noble Roman, Valerius. After the apparition of an angel in the marriage chamber, she converted the young man to Christianity and persuaded both him and his brother, Tibertius, to receive baptism. She then refused to make an offering to the pagan gods and was condemned to be suffocated in a boiler, but was saved by the descent of a refreshing cloud from the sky. She was then taken to be beheaded, but the executioner, even after three violent blows, could not detach her head. She lingered on, mutilated, for three days before expiring.The fresco cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia consists of ten scenes from the legend of Saints Cecilia and Valerian, located on the north (scenes 1-5) and south (scenes 6-10) walls of the Oratory, which is connected by a passageway to the church of San Domenico Maggiore. The cycle, resembling a continuous frieze, is very different from the sort of painting normally found in parish churches. It bears a greater resemblance to the suites of canvases produced for Venetian oratories and assembly rooms.The ten horizontal panels, each filled with life-size figures in the foreground, create the impression of a continuous pictorial narrative, one that is structured but not actually interrupted by the framing pilasters. The continuous background landscapes incorporate scenes from the legend of St Cecilia, a large part of which involves the conversions and martyrdoms of her husband Valerian and his brother Tiburtius. Also depicted are the Roman official Maximus, another convert, and Pope Urban I as the saints' protectors, who are soon afterward martyred themselves.The predominant character of the cycle completely reflects the styles of the two masters who set the tone for the Bolognese school in around 1500, namely Lorenzo Costa the Elder and Francesco Francia. They must be regarded as the ones who devised the St Cecilia cycle, which was ultimately realized by collaborators whose names can no longer be determined with the exception of two panels with the signature of Amico Aspertini. The fact that the first pictures on each wall are by Francia would indicate that he was the supervisor of the project.Three pairs of scenes were executed by Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa the Elder, and Amico Aspertini. The author of the two other pairs are not known, here we present the reproductions of these scenes among the works by Francesco Francia.  The scenes of the cycle are the following:Scene 1: Marriage of Cecilia and Valerian (Francesco Francia)Scene 2: Valerian with Pope Urban (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 3: Valerian is Baptized (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 4: Coronation of Cecilia and Valerian (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 5: Martyrdom of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 6: Burial of Valerian and Tiburtius (Amico Aspertini)Scene 7: Cecilia Disputing with Almachius (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 8: Martyrdom of St Cecilia (unknown, displayed in Francesco Francia's section)Scene 9: Cecilia Gives away Her Possessions (Lorenzo Costa the Elder)Scene 10: Burial of St Cecilia (Francesco Francia

00766-lastjud1.jpg	Elevated in the deep azure sky and surrounded by concentric rings of cherubim and angels, Christ sits on a glowing bank of clouds as he judges the world. He is flanked by the interceding figures of John the Baptist and the Virgin. Rows of saints and prophets, identified by their distinctive attributes, varied expressions and brilliantly coloured mantles, sit suspended on clouds in the heavens. A long row of tombs leads to the distant horizon, bisecting the valley below. To the right of Christ, the Blessed kneel in adoration, their faces radiant with the love of God, as angels dance in a circle in the verdant vegetation of Paradise. Golden rays of light stream through the open gates of the City of God and illuminate the white gowns of the Blessed seeking entry. To Christ's left, demons with pitchforks drive the agonized Damned into the mouth of a mountainous Hell. The ghastly torments that await them are portrayed within its flaming circles, where naked sinners, some strangled with snakes, suffer for their transgressions.The abundance of figures (270 in all), nuanced evocation of their emotions, descending perspective of the row of tombs and ascending landscape reveal a mastery of narrative and space that was unprecedented in Angelico's small-scale works.

14911-early13.jpg	In July 1885 Gauguin went to Dieppe, where he stayed at the house of a friend until October of that year, except for a few weeks spent in London. The subject matter of sea bathing was to interest him increasingly at this time, and he showed another version of the same theme at the eighth Impressionist exhibition, in which the women in the waves assume greater prominence within the picture space (the work is now in the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo). Gradually, the theme became more symbolic and the waves serve as a metaphor for sexual fulfillment. At this stage, however, the subject retains a naturalistic flavour and treatment, with a rapid impressionistic brushstroke and an attempt at representing an everyday scene. At the same time, there is a marked gulf between the four figures huddled on the shore and the sea bathers; each group seems self-contained, isolated and unaware of the other's existence, a notion that Gauguin would explore again in works like the Yellow Christ

43191-sisera.jpg	Sisera was a cruel Canaanite leader who ruled the Israelites for twenty years. Barak defeated his nine hundred charioteers by a surprise Israelite attack. Sisera escaped and sought refuge in the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite. She gave the terrified Canaanite sanctuary. When he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg into his brain.

43165-de_stael.jpg	Madame de Sta&#235;l, daughter of the French minister of finance, Jacques Necker, achieved fame on the basis of her turbulent lifestyle and two literary works: De l'Allemagne (1810), a portrait of Germany, its customs, literature and philosophy, and her novel Corinne ou l'ltalie (1807). In this work based on her travels in Italy in the company of August Wilhelm Schlegel, after Napoleon had exiled her from Paris, she records her impressions of Italy in glowing tones through the mouth-piece of the fictitious Italian poetess Corinne. Vig�e-Lebrun portrays her in the role of Corinne wearing an antique robe, with a lyre on her lap, as a female Orpheus. Behind this figure there is a cliff crowned by a classical monopteros, and a sweeping landscape that fades into the distance with gentle, green hills and blue mountain peaks. The concept of the classical and the romantic which Madame de Sta&#235;l was first to use in its present sense, are echoed in these two landscape types. The flawless idealization that marks so many of this artist's works is countered here by the powerful vitality of the face: a mature, confident and energetic woman of astute intellect who is by no means identical with the role of glowing and effusive rapture

20028-peacocks.jpg	A group of Dutch artists in the seventeenth century represented live domesticated and wild birds. Their pictures do not belong to the category of still-life, but their emphasis on the textural and colouristic beauty of their subjects gives a still-life character to their works. Their patrons probably included the rich burghers who lived as landed aristocrats on estates in the country where they kept exotic as well as native fowl. Just as some painters were called upon by flower fanciers to make portraits of favourite blossoms, others were asked by amateur and professional poultry breeders to paint prize birds and common farmyard specimens. Melchior de Hondecoeter, who also painted a few game still-lifes, was the pre-eminent specialist of this branch of painting.Depicting birds was a tradition in Hondecoeter's family. His grandfather was Gillis d' Hondecoeter (c. 1570-1638), an artist often inspired by Roelandt Savery's landscapes crammed with domesticated and exotic birds and animals, and his father, Gijsbert d' Hondecoeter (1604-1653), was a landscapist and a painter of birds, particularly waterfowl and poultry. Melchior is both observant and gifted as a colourist, and admirably renders the texture of his feathery creatures

34175-christsb.jpg	The first Spanish painter in the 17th century to abandon Mannerism for the new realistic style was Francisco Ribalta, a Catalan who, after receiving his early training in Toledo spent the years of his maturity in Valencia. It is not known whether Ribalta was aquainted with the work of Caravaggio or whether he arrived independently at results parallel to those achieved by the Italian Tenebrists. At all events, his style is remarkable for its virile naturalism. The brushwork is increasingly bold and free, so different from the polished smoothness of the previous age. Ribalta sought expressiveness as well as beauty and accentuated the sculptural modeling of his forms by contrasting light and shade. Among his better known works are the Last Supper in the Valencia Museum and the panels of the great altarpiece of Algemesi, painted in 1603; one of these, that depicting the martyrdom of St James, suggests a connection between Ribalta and Navarrete.The Christ Embracing St Bernard came from the Cartuja de Porta Coeli, Valencia, and was painted in the mid-1620s. Here, perhaps for the first time, a Spanish painter was able to realize the full potential of the naturalist style to communicate profound religious feelings. The depiction of St Bernard's rapturous vision is perfectly calculated to achieve maximum effect. The saint is represented as a gaunt figure with prominent cheekbones and deep-set eyes. He embraces Christ, and his mouth forms a half smile that communicates the holy rapture suffusing his body and soul. As Christ descends from the cross to meet him, St Bernard's body goes limp and needs to be supported by the Savior. Under the tightly focused light, the figures seem palpable. Exercising superb control of the composition and every detail, Ribalta succeeds in externalising this powerful religious experience, making it seem real but not commonplace

A pupil of his uncle Jan van Scorel, from 1549 he enjoyed the protection of Cardinal Granvelle, with whom he travelled to Rome. This trip brought him into contact with the works of the great Cinquecento masters and with Mannerism. He combined the sharp eye for a close likeness characteristic of Netherlandish painting with the portrait style of Titian, which glorified the symbolic importance of the person portrayed.

33256-flagella.jpg	The Flagellation is a wing of the Herrenbeg Altar in Herrenberg parish church. The Herrenberg Altar reflects the religious and social unrest of its day with a directness unequalled in any other work of German painting. Here, at an early point in time, the harmony of the High Renaissance has been destroyed in every respect. The panels of the altar, which is signed 1519, depict scenes from the childhood and Passion of Christ. A fantastical rotunda provides the architectural framework not just for the Flagellation in the centre, but also for Christ's crowning with thorns (front right), presentation to the populace (on the steps in the background) and interrogation by Pilate (on the top storey).With no knowledge of Italian art, the artist takes up some of the fundamental principles of Florentine Early Mannerism: the disruption of logical spatial relationships through the use of drastic foreshortening and enormous differences in scale between the figures; an asymmetrical composition combined with an emphatic spiralling movement around the central pillar; the distortion of natural proportions to heighten expressiveness; and finally a bright, iridescent palette.With its manifold foreshortenings, vistas and staggered levels, the complex architecture might be seen as a distant forerunner of the visionary, surreal interiors of Giovanni Battista Piranesi's Carceri d'invenzione (Imaginary Prisons)

16659-st_john.jpg	Together with Sassetta, Giovanni di Paolo was one of the leading Sienese painters in the fifteenth century. So strong was the hold on Sienese art of its great fourteenth-century masters - Duccio and his followers - that both Giovanni di Paolo and Sassetta consistently harked back to earlier models.Giovanni's dual allegiance to the modern and the old can clearly be seen in the four predella panels of Scenes from the Life of Saint John the Baptist at the National Gallery in London, of which Saint John retiring to the Desert is likely to have been the second from the left. The other panels represent the saint's birth, the Baptism of Christ, and the Feast of Herod at which Salome's dance and Herod's reward for it brought about the decapitation of the saint. The story of Saint John the Baptist is told in the Gospels and in legend, and its pictorial tradition was well established by the fifteenth century. The altarpiece of which these panels formed the predella - a box-like supporting element for the main painting - was a large Madonna and Saints perhaps painted for the church of Sant'Agostino in Siena (now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York).This scene shows the Baptist as a child, carrying his few needs on his shoulder, leaving the familiar city gate to make his way up into the wilderness. Just to his right we see him again, several miles away, but not reduced at all in scale: a giant walking up the steep mountain path. The head and torso of the two figures are almost identical, but as John climbs he slings his bundle over the other shoulder. Thus the spectator has moved with St John, and the foreground landscape becomes the vista opening up below as the child climbs. The picture is about renouncing the city, leaving behind the man-made grid of cultivated fields, its beautiful patchwork of contrasted greens, for a world of wilder forms. Higher up, we glimpse a yet further region - a blue-and-white ice realm, across a dark river, extending to the curved rim of the horizon - all laid in with a scintillating economy of mark.Charming are the borders of roses painted entirely realistically on either side. Curiously, these are seen from below, as by a viewer at eye level with the lower bud on each branch

23297-08spiri.jpg	Lotto's three great altarpieces for churches in Bergamo (the San Bartolomeo Altarpiece, the San Bernardino Altarpiece and the Santo Spirito Altarpiece), which were painted between 1516 and 1521, in the same periods as Titian's Assumption and Pesaro altar, are High Renaissance compositions, but closer, in their symmetrical arrangement, to Florentine painters like Fra Bartolommeo and Albertinelli, than to Titian himself. Yet for all the balance of their compositions, they remain restless in detail, and a passion for bright local colour, and smooth hard surfaces prevents Lotto from achieving, or even aiming at, the painterly unity of his contemporaries. This failure to integrate perhaps reflects, at the deepest level, the tensions of a neurotic personality.The Santo Spirito Altarpiece offers further proof of the variety of Lotto's sources of inspiration. While the infant St John hugging the lamb can be linked to Leonardo, the variegated flight of angels above the Virgin's head can be seen in relation to Correggio's parallel inventions.The represented saints in the Santo Spirito Altarpiece are Catherine of Alexandria, Augustine, Sebastian, Anthony the Abbot, and the Young John the Baptist

26095-26nomus.jpg	"Memling produced this three-part panel painting more than half a century after the Ghent Altar-piece of the van Eyck brothers. The central panel not reproduced here shows the figure of Christ surrounded by&#183; singing angels. Thus, laudative music again accompanies the theme of ""Majestas Domini"". Formalistically, however, the artist does not follow the famous example. One explanation for this is the original purpose of the panels and their horizontally rectangular shape. They used to decorate the organ loft in the church of the Castilian city of Najera. Located relatively high, they were placed in a long, horizontal row, hence the large and bust-like appearance of the figures.The accurate rendering of the numerous players may create the impression that the painter wanted to present an ensemble of contemporary musical instruments. In fact, however, the composition reveals an arrangement of strict symmetry, partly suggested by the hierarchical order of angels and the related symbolism of instruments, although the classification is not as clear as in the works of Giotto or Geertgen. In the central panel depicting Christ, six singing angels represent music of the highest order. On each side of Him (on the right of the first panel, and on the left of the second), in a mirror arrangement, are two wind instruments: one trumpet on each side and a zink and busine, representing the order of ""trumpeting"" herald angels. Moving further away from the centre, on the left we see stringed instruments: a lute, a tromba marina and a psaltery, while on the right the mellower, quieter instruments, a portative organ, a harp and a fiddle. The psaltery, for example, was used exclusively to accompany psalms and beseeching prayers."

11175-1870s_75.jpg	In his early scenes from the theatrical world, Degas depicted only that which the audience or musicians could see of the stage. However, later he went backstage, and he became a cool observer of rehearsals. In his paintings the stage changed from being an incidental setting of the picture to become the theme of the picture itself. Following his works showing the rehearsal room and the stage as a whole (even when only a corner is depicted), there came his series of astounding variations on the theme of dancers, in groups or isolated, in which the artist gained more and more freedom of vision, forever changing angles and capturing the ballerinas in the most surprising positions. The dancers are painted more and more in close-up. They do not move within a well-defined three-dimensional space, they fill the foreground with colours against the wings and curtains.The most remarkable among these works are the different versions of Ballerina with a Bouquet, Curtsying. The dancer is a sylph, arms outstretched, and still carried by the last movement at the close of her solo. She bows, bathed in the brilliant spotlight, with the unreal, fantastic decor of the ballet as her background

07706-3presen1.jpg	Two panels of virtually the same size, depicting scenes constructed on a precisely mirror-image perspective grid, are in the centre of sustained scholarly debate which extends to both the subjects, the function, and the authorship. They depict ostensibly religious subjects with a plethora of detail taken, on the one hand, from contemporary life and inspired, on the other, by humanist-antiquarian interests. One of the panels (in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) represents the Birth of the Virgin, the other (in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) probably shows the Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple.These two highly original pictures can be identified with an altarpiece painted by Fra Carnevale for a lay fraternity of flagellants in the hospital church of Santa Maria della Bella in Urbino. In the seventeenth century the altarpiece was confiscated by Cardinal Antonio Barberini, and in the 1930s they were sold from the Barberini collection to the museums in New York and Boston.The Virgin (the young girl in blue) is depicted at the head of the procession filing into the basilica-like temple. She passes three beggars - a common embellishment of the scene. Instead of the traditional Jewish priest officiating at the event, Fra Carnevale places three figures at the high altar, apparently a Franciscan, a Dominican and a hooded figure - while two pilgrims are seen against the right-hand entrance pier. The remaining figures in the church are exclusively young males who chat, rest, or walk about. The decorative reliefs on the church fa�ade above clearly depict events in the Virgin's life, The Annunciation and the Visitation. On the basis of the columns a dancing maenad and a satyr with pipes, as well as a classical urn with a branch protruding from its opening symbolize the pagan past

07833-3disput.jpg	Thanks to the penetrating clarity of the light and brilliant architectural fantasy, mingling classical and oriental elements, the episode now in Milan is certainly the best of the cycle. Eastern scholars mix with the brothers of the School as they listen to St. Stephen's sermon.In the scene of the Disputation of St Stephen, the saint is shown below a wide and spacious loggia, clearly modelled on the architecture of Pietro Lombardo, placed slightly at an angle. On the bases of the columns in the foreground, in the most visible place, Vittore Carpaccio signed his name and inscribed the date, 1514. Around the deep greens and browns of the Venetian hills he has arranged a series of buildings, in a varied combination of architectural styles which suggest a fairytale Orient and a Western world that is also a product of the imagination. In this painting Carpaccio gives his imagination free rein, creating the most eccentric architectural constructions of any of his works; such as the equestrian monument placed on very high marble supports pierced by free-standing sculptures; or the pyramid that blends into the opalescent sphere; or the elaborate building to the right, next to the walls that recede in a typical diagonal perspective foreshortening.Against this totally imaginary architectural background, highlighted and animated by the colour patches of the groups of characters, Carpaccio has given us a series of concrete and realistic portraits, probably of members of the confraternity who were much more interested in having their portrait painted than they were in the debate between St Stephen and the Orientals

In these paintings the sitter, occasionally a friend posing in the studio, is relocated in a sweet poetic world that reflects the personality of the person portrayed. In such cases the subject becomes an archetype or an allegory, and often appears immersed in a deep reverie.

11168-1870s_68.jpg	Horse racing, a sport of English origin, became popular on the Continent at the end of the eighteenth century, and soon inspired such painters as Carle Vernet and Th�odore G�ricault, who were both influenced by English artists. It attracted the interest of later painters, too. Manet emphasized the elegance of these occasions, while Degas preferred to observe the horses in motion. He focused on the movements of man and animal. His first sketches of racecourses date back to the beginning of the 1860s. At first he was interested  in the jockeys, but he also turned a keen eye on the spectators.In the present painting the figures are grouped in the lower right-hand corner, cut off by the corner of the frame. The composition is similar to that of the earlier At the Races in the Countryside, but the emphasis on realistic drawing, which is evident in the earlier work, is replaced here by an arrangement of broad patches of colour. Degas is still attracted by the nervous elegance and disciplined dancing grace of the horses, but everything is blended in a harmony of colours, which turns the canvas into a mosaic

30686-vase2.jpg	This painting and its pendant in the same private collection show a gilt metal, large-handled ewer of flowers resting on a roughly hewn and worn stone support against a grey background. A variety of large flowers are loosely arranged in the vases with a natural looking, informal air and an asymmetrical compositional relationship between the large and small blooms. The bouquets seem to overwhelm their containers and a sense of the fullness of the arrangements is conveyed by the depiction of the flowers occupying the planes farthest away from the viewer in less detail and in darker tones than those in the foreground. A number of climbing flowers tease the space around the flower pieces and particularly charming touches include the jasmine that trails over the ledge in one of the pictures and the convolvulus that seems to head towards the droplets of water on the ledge in the other. The conspicuous dew drops on the flowers and leaves in one of the paintings is an obvious means of persuading the viewer of the freshness of the blooms, although this device was relatively little used by Spanish flower painters

22438-marketsc.jpg	This painting confronts the spectator with a curious, if not bizarre combination of more or less identifiable topographical elements. A broad, seemingly rural, crowded market square reminiscent of the Campo Vaccino in Rome is bordered on the left by a dark row of large ruins and buildings, which enclose the scene like the wings of a stage set. On the far left is the corner of a classical temple, modelled on the nearby Temple of Saturn. Between the ruin and the tall, sturdy houses further towards the centre of the image is a narrow view of the stairway leading up to the Capitoline, depicted on a noticeably reduced scale.A prominent place on the market square has been cleared for a powerful sculptural group. In reality, this classical sculpture of a lion attacking a horse was housed in the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Capitoline in the seventeenth century. Further to the right, the square gradually gives way to a plain with the fountain from the Campo Vaccino at the far end. The plain is demarcated by the ruins of an imaginary city or palace, beyond which we discern hills reminiscent of the Latian landscape. Both square and plain are crowded with a rich variety of figures, including bird and fruit vendors, a storyteller, beggars, farmers, a horsedrawn carriage and a conspicuously large number of well-dressed Dutch burghers.It is not known whether Lingelbach's later work reached Rome and Venice as early as the seventeenth century. Still it seems probable that Luca Carlevaris must have known Lingelbach's paintings, for compositional formulae characteristic of the Dutch artist recur in many of Carlevaris's paintings, whether these are topographically correct or not

18257-0705grec.jpg	This canvas with its larger than life-size figures is one of three versions which El Greco painted of the subject. The impression of the artist's Venetian years, and particularly the works of Titian, can still be felt in the strictly centralized composition, in the relatively plastic modelling of the figures, and above all in the sophistication of the the palette. The way in which the figures below left are sliced by the frame, and the slight foreshortening empolyed in the figure of Christ, who appears to be leaning backwards into the picture, suggest that the canvas was destined to be hung at some height. If we consider in this regard the luminous red of Christ's robe, by which he is made to stand out from the crowd, and the multiple verticals of the figures and lances, the painting seems to point beyond its immediate subject to the coming ascension

40879-03gudulf.jpg	The most original painter of the late 15th century, known to us today as the Master of the View of St Gudule, certainly knew the original of the St Luke Madonna (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), which had probably been created as an altarpiece for the Brussels painters' guild. In his Madonna with Donor and St Mary Magdalene, he drew on the older painting for its colouring as well as its composition; he obviously liked such details as the green-bordered red-gold cloth of honour. In placing the donor with her prie-dieu where St Luke had been, the painter of these elegant figures almost found his way back to the work that was Rogier's own point of departure, Jan van Eyck's Rolin Madonna (Louvre, Paris). The painter uses a style based on brilliant effects of colour and very artificial, almost affected figures. The figures in the garden are no longer a humble elderly couple but very fashionable young people gazing at picturesque ships

30518-rest_fli.jpg	Patenier is considered to be the first landscape artist of the Renaissance. Like many painters of the period, he uses landscape to create a suitable setting for the figures in his scenes. But although he integrates his narrative within them, his landscapes become more than mere backgrounds, and begin to assume their own autonomy. For the most part, Patenier maintains an equilibrium within his paintings between the presence of the figures and the landscape, and only in a few is he bold enough to shift this balance in favour of his vision of nature. His detailed technique is typical of Flemish artists, but his novelty lies in his creation of space and depth through subtle gradations of light and colour, as well as a certain effort at capturing the atmosphere of the scene

07907-butchers.jpg	Using the language of the Bible, theologians have referred to the dangers of the consumer habits which emanate from such abundant supply of products as 'temptations of the flesh,' and these are quite often the theme of rather graphic paintings of butchers' shops. Like Aertsen and Beuckelaer's art, in the 16th century they are not yet pure still-lifes, although they do display the tendency towards materialization inherent in this genre.In Annibale Carracci's painting with this motif, the characters are facing the viewer as if they were on stage. On the right a butcher's servant is dragging along a freshly cut ox or cow, the spine and innards visible as in an anatomical longitudinal section, which he is about to hang on a hook. Another servant is kneeling beside a sheep that is lying on the ground, its legs tied, which he is about to slaughter. A third servant is holding a pair of scales, adjusting its weights. In the background, a butcher is taking a hook off the ceiling. Goods are exhibited in front of him, and an old woman is seen stealing a piece of meat without being noticed by the butcher. On the left a rather foolish-looking man, dressed in a dandy-like manner with a feathered hat, tattered, baggy yellow trousers and a huge codpiece, can be seen rummaging awkwardly in his purse. The actions of the characters show that the painting is a thematic representation of a literary motif from a picaresque tale

09535-fresco1.jpg	This fresco was originally part of a cycle of paintings in the former reception room of the Casa Bartholdy in Rome. They were painted in 1815-17. At the end of the 19th century the frescoes were taken down and moved to Berlin. Jacob's Lament is by Schadow, while Philipp Veit (1793-1877) painted the lunette above it, The Fat Years, and the large-scale Joseph and Potiphar's Wife. Cornelius painted the Joseph Interpreting Pharaoh's Dream - also crowned by a lunette, The Lean Years by Overbeck - and The Recognition of Joseph by his Brothers. The artists regarded the cycle as their main work and they all made watercolour versions on a small scale, which were shown in the Berlin Academy exhibition in the autumn of 1818, framed with architectural divisions.In this painting the Pharaoh sits listening attentively, deep in thought, to the prophecies of the future that Joseph is counting for him on his fingers, like an arithmetical exercise. In the listeners Cornelius has shown the whole range of reactions - from the scribe's factual record, through keen attention and skepticism to disbelief in the figure disappearing into the dark. But the painter's idea to show the dream in the round panels on the sides  is interesting. They are like a projection by a laterna magica.It should be pointed out that colour did not play an important part in these frescoes. Similarly, particular attention has not been paid to the composition as a whole; the individual figures are conceived as part of a cumulative show. The narrative coexistence determines the picture - as in Nazarene art generally.

14060-boxopera.jpg	Like Degas, the youthful Jean-Louis Forain had a preference for theatre and restaurant motifs. He was one of the strongest artistic personalities among Degas's followers. Under the influence of Goya and Daumier he mainly did graphic work as magazine and book illustrations or in series. As a painter he had mastered Impressionist techniques, having a precise touch for light conditions and a subtle flair for the structural division of a visual space. His small format scenes of the entertainment world used distinctive contrasts of dark and light or of strong, glowing colour, and combined sketchy adumbrations with more substantial blocks of solid colour that had their own patchwork, asymmetrical values

29329-5nagybal.jpg	"The picture, a small one with a figure, is the most significant composition in Nagy Balogh's series of 40 pictures on navvies. He does not want to depict a single scene but he concludes the general from a sight he often saw. The figure of a worker standing in front of the low horizon is bursting the picture, he becomes timeless and akin to figures in Egyptian frescoes thousands of years before. The painter is trying to arrest the figure in a characteristc and dynamic movement and to make his solid statics a part of an architectural structure. Nagy Balogh cannot have known much of C�zanne's art or the cubists' or the Eights' principles of composition; his figure, controlled and closed, the arrow and the simplified geometrical mass of the earth indicate constructivism. The logical, clear composition dominates a subdued world of colours. The ochre and green of  the light blue and the gently sloping landscape, which is hardly disturbed by the glazed browns and blue of shadows, the yellowish jacket of the figure fitting into these surroundings, orangish-pinkish trousers and gentle reflexes are suggestive of a real artistic sensitivity. Reflexes of light, the clothes and the barrow make the atmosphere of the picture peculiar. In this poetic realism, Nagy Balogh's ""Navvy"" is elevated to the symbol of a man who works in nature and who overcomes it; this symbol culminates in Derkovits' lyric portrayal of workers"

The Flemish acquisitions were the responsibility of the cardinal infante Ferdinand, king Philip IV's brother and governor of Flanders, who flooded the Rubens workshop with commissions. For the Retiro he obtained more than a hundred paintings, including landscapes, allegories of the seasons and months of the year, hunting scenes and illustrations of Aesop's fables.

29330-6nagybal.jpg	"Nagy Balogh managed to appraise at the beginning of his career where he could best rival with painters who had an academic education. This is why he began to survey the surroundings of his well-known home and to study fundamental esthetic issues arising from the world of simple interiors. His early interiors of rooms and kitchens were characterized by indiscriminate selection. He is trying to reproduce his poorly studio in a ""narrative style"". These pictures are characterized by carefully selected light effects, by colours embedded in brown, which reflect the influence of Munich and a respect of Munk�csy. Interiors with a spontaneous portrayal were substituted by more mature compositions of the early 1910s. Elements of ""Atelier"" are those of a stylized architecture.

00622-10tolent.jpg	Not long after the SS. Annunziata comission, the Opera del Duomo commissioned the monument to the commander Niccol&#242; da Tolentino, which Andrea completed in March 1456. For this painting Castagno had to revert to the monumental and heroic model he had used in the Legnaia cycle. His description of the tense muscles of the horse and the general's furrowed face are very acute naturalistic observations that break the rigidity of that model.A comparison of Andrea's Tolentino with Paolo Uccello's Sir John Hawkwood, painted in the same cathedral several years earlier (1436), is inevitable. While Uccello froze the horse and its rider into a static composition of rigid geometric precision, Andrea expressed through the tension and movement of this fresco all the restlessness and vitality of his spirit.The Monument to Niccol&#242; da Tolentino in Florence Cathedral is the last work by Castagno that still survives; in 1457 he frescoed a Last Supper for the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli, but it has not come down to us

20106-41hooch.jpg	Soon after de Hooch's move to Amsterdam his works gain a little more in power and body, and his colour and chiaroscuro increase in warmth. This is seen in the full character of the figures in the Woman Peeling Apples with its concentration on the motif close to the spectator without side views. The painting recalls Vermeer's paintings of one or two figures in a lighted corner of a room, and is theme of a woman watched by a child as she works at a simple kitchen task is related to Maes's depictions of household activities. Yet de Hooch's painting is unmistakably his own; his ability to suggest the intensity and flow of light is undiminished, and the relationship between the woman and child absorbed in their simple activities retains human charm and naturalness

04202-mad_cruc.jpg	From the beginning of the 13th century the Berlinghieri, a family of painters (Berlinghiero and his sons Barone, Marco and Bonaventura), were working in Lucca. They were influenced by the new wave of Byzantinism which reached the peninsula after the capture of Constantinople by the crusaders.The painting represents one of the earliest surviving examples of the 'Eleusa' Virgin, the 'Affectionate Mother', an iconographic model that was first used for portable household altars although it subsequently became increasingly po[ular and widespread until the end of the fourteenth century, being well suited to the emotional tendency expressed by Gothic art. Bonaventura Berlinghieri instils a liveliness into the figures and objects with a refined, almost miniaturist technique. There is, however, a clear reference to Byzantine models which allow the artist to express his lyrical mysticism.The painting comes probably from the workshop of Berlinghieri and it is dated variously to the second half of the 13th century

38296-lion_dev.jpg	The young George Stubbs made a journey to Rome in 1754. He was already known as a painter of animals, and his earliest biographer recorded his failure to make the usual studies of classical monuments. But the suggestive power of one antiquity in particular, a pre-Hellenistic sculpture of a horse attacked by a lion in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, moved him to his own depiction of fear. For thirty years Stubbs meditated on this theme of conflict, producing at least seventeen works in oil or enamel, clay or mixed-method engraving, adopting an episodic, four-part sequence beginning with the horse's first terrified sight of the lion emerging from its cave and ending - closest to the Antique source - with its exhausted collapse beneath its attacker. The picture shows this last episode

24825-heilige1.jpg	This artist, who was most probably trained in France but active in Austria, derived his name from a diptych which originated from Heiligenkreuz. The picture reproduced here also has a counterpart representing the death of the Virgin.We can see nuns and saints busy praying around the dead saint beside her canopied bed. In the opening showing blue sky at the top, Jesus is depicted receiving the infant which symbolizes the saint's soul as it rises to heaven. Angels holding banners and musical instruments are incised in the golden background. Rather surprisingly at the right side the same angels have descended from the flat background and settled down upon the canopy. The arrangement of the whole upper right-hand side is very characteristic of the International Gothic style and can be imagined virtually only in this period of painting. It is strange in itself that the painter suspended the canopy from two ropes, although no trace of a ceiling is discernible. A singular blend of a stylized, decorative pattern and the representation of three-dimensional forms is shown by the golden angels, who cover a part of the farther rope. This is a peculiar manifestation of the detailed realism mentioned in the introduction, by which the decorative motifs are incorporated into the realistic interpretation of the scene. The angels appearing from the clouds on the left and depicted in an entirely abstract way have become embodied in the right corner, where they come nearer to the real world, while the golden background is transformed into an aerial substance. The same intention - the harmonization of heavenly and earthly details - is reflected by the way in which the faces and hands of the angels with censers who appear below the canopy are depicted with the same three-dimensional quality as are the saints and nuns. In fact, the painter's basic problem throughout the composition was to integrate the interpretation of the sacred and the temporal elements. By adhering to the golden background he wanted to bring the spectator close to St Claire's deathbed, but he was able to achieve this only by placing the bed on a grassy space, in the open air instead of in the interior of a room

33556-085portr.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 113.Rembrandt did share his later years with Hendrickje Stoffels (1626-1663) who had become his live-in companion and she was even more featured as his subject than Saskia had been. She is first mentioned as a member of Rembrandt's household in a document of 1 October 1649. She was then about twenty-three. She bore him a daughter, Cornelia, in 1654 and remained with him until her death in 1663. Rembrandt never married her, presumably because a second marriage would have deprived him of the much-needed income from Saskia's dowry, held in trust under the terms of her will for their son, Titus. In 1654, shortly before she bore a daughter, Cornelia, Hendrickje was officially censured by the church council for living in sin.Hendrickje Stoffels is nowhere explicitly identified in Rembrandt's art. However, there exist up to half-a-dozen portraits of an attractive, round-faced woman, showing her at different ages, painted during the period when Hendrickje lived with Rembrandt as his mistress, and these are generally agreed to be of her. They reveal an affection and degree of intimacy between artist and sitter that would be inconceivable in a commissioned portrait, and at the same time the face is too strongly characterized for it to be that of an anonymous model. The full-bodied nude of the 1654 Bathsheba has traditionally been identified with Hendrickje and accords well with her numerous portraits and studies.The present portrait is one of the most private in all Rembrandt's work. It is very quiet and dignified in mood but also sensuous, even sensual, in feeling

However, his Susanna at the Bath reveals an almost disturbing eroticism and something of that peculiarly chilly Rococo quality which is to be found in Falconet's nude statuettes. Few comparable pictures were to be produced at Venice, whereas Santerre initiates a whole troop of 'baigneuses' who go on dabbling with the erotic possibilities of water as late as Fragonard, all seeming ultimately to derive from Correggio's Leda. And out of this revolution was to come the achievement of Boucher as well as Fragonard

42605-22pearl.jpg	"Signature: Signed top left.Provenance: The provenance of this painting cannot be traced back very far. All earlier documents or sales catalogs cited by Blankert are pure guesswork. Vermeer seems to have painted a number of ""heads,"" and various cited 'tronie', as they were called, cannot be further identified. We only know for certain that the work was purchased at the beginning of 1882 for the collection A. A. des Tombe of The Hague for fl. 2.30 in the sale Braam of the same city. The des Tombe collection was a public collection and bequeathed the picture in 1903 to the Mauritshuis.This charming portrait of a girl is unfortunately in a very poor state of conservation and suffered from numerous extensive restorations. It is furthermore marred by an ugly pattern of cracks. Nevertheless, it became famous after its rediscovery and was dubbed the ""Gioconda of the North"" by many enthusiastic critics. Fortunately, enough of the original is left to permit the savouring of a truly outstanding and partly exotic work.The girl is seen against a neutral, dark background, very nearly black, which establishes a powerful three-dimensionality of effect. Seen from the side, the girl is turning to gaze at us, and her lips are slightly parted, as if she were about to speak to us. It is an illusionist approach often adopted in Dutch art. She is inclining her head slightly to one side as if lost in thought, yet her gaze is keen.The girl is dressed in an unadorned, brownish-yellow jacket, and the shining white collar contrasts clearly against it. The blue turban represents a further contrast, while a lemon-yellow, veil-like cloth falls from its peak to her shoulders. Vermeer used plain, pure colours in this painting, limiting the range of tones. As a result, the number of sections of colour are small, and these are given depth and shadow by the use of varnish of the same colour.The girl's headdress has an exotic effect. Turbans were a popular fashionable accessory in Europe as early as the 15th century, as is shown by Jan van Eyck's probable self portrait, now in the National Gallery in London. During the wars against the Turks, the remote way of life and foreign dress of the ""enemy of Christendom"" proved to be very fascinating. A particularly noticeable feature of Vermeer's painting is the large, tear-shaped pearl hanging from the girl's ear; part of it has a golden sheen, and it stands out from the part of the neck which is in shadow.In his Introduction to the Devout Life (1608), which was published in a Dutch translation in 1616, the mystic St Francis De Sales (1567-1622) wrote, ""Both now and in the past it has been customary for women to hang pearls from their ears; as Pliny observed, they gain pleasure from the sensation of the swinging pearls touching them. But I know that God's friend, Isaac, sent earrings to chaste Rebecca as a first token of his love. This leads me to think that this jewel has a spiritual meaning, namely that the first part of the body that a man wants, and which a woman must loyally protect, is the ear; no word or sound should enter it other than the sweet sound of chaste words, which are the oriental pearls of the gospel.""From this it is clear that the pearl in Vermeer's painting is a symbol of chastity. The oriental aspect, which is mentioned in the above extract, is further emphasised by the turban. The reference to Isaac and Rebecca suggests that this picture could have been painted on the occasion of this young woman's marriage. So to that extent it is a portrait.There is surely a similar explanation for the Head of a Girl dressed in a smart, grey dress (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). One must admire the artist's technique, which features application of the pigments in juxtaposition and melting, avoiding precise lines, and therefore blurring the contours of different colours so as to obtain effects that foreshadow those of the impressionists. The dark backgrounds that Vermeer chose in these two portraits enhance the plasticity of the models"

43066-p_woman.jpg	Verspronck was a son of the Haarlem painter Cornelis Engelsz (1574/75-1650) who probably trained him. His earliest existing portraits, done in the mid-thirties, show the strong influence of Frans Hals's invention, but he never attempted to emulate Hals's bold brushwork or temperament. His touch is restrained and his works are highly finished. Original was a penchant he soon developed for depicting sitters off centre leaving a wide, neutral background to the right or left of them; these areas are always exquisitely modulated from light to dark. This propensity is seen in his Portrait of a Woman of 1644 (a companion-piece representing the portrait of a man is also in The Hermitage); subsequently, he sets patrons much closer to the canvas's edge. His palette rarely deviates from rich, shining blacks, subtle greys, browns, and white.Like Hals, Verspronck was a particularly sensitive portraitist of women. His contemporaries in Haarlem apparently sensed this too. He was never commissioned to paint a regent group portrait but he was hired to execute two of regentesses. They are his most imposing paintings. The first group, dated 1641, depicts the Regentesses of the St Elizabeth Hospital. It was painted as a companion piece to Hals's group portrait of the regents of the same institution executed in the same year, and, like Hals's, it was done for the hospital and still belongs to it. The two paintings vie for the distinction of being the first regent group portraits painted in Haarlem

42814-2coccin.jpg	Along with three other pictures for devotional purposes (the Marriage Feast at Cana, the Adoration of the Magi, and the Road to Calvary), this painting originally formed part of the furnishings of the Palazzo Coccina (now Palazzo Papadopoli) on the Grand Canal in Venice. After Charles I of England had fruitlessly tried to obtain them in 1644, the pairs of pictures passed in 1645 to Francesco I d'Este in Modena. In 1746, his descendant Francesco III sold them to Augustus III, King of Saxony.Veronese places the episodes from the Gospels in a setting of great narrative richness, in which the figures, in modern dress, perform like actors on a stage. In the Adoration of the Virgin by the Coccina Family, it is the members of the family who take part in this sort of play.

37810-manett11.jpg	The present fresco is one of the twelve fragments to survive from a fresco cycle devoted to scenes from the life of St John the Baptist in the Manetti Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence identified on the basis of engravings made by Thomas Patch in 1772. The frescoes were already in poor condition in 1763-64 when they were restored. When the church of the Carmine was largely destroyed by fire in 1771, they suffered comparatively little. Patch made the engravings in 1772 and removed some fragments from the wall, the rest was presumably destroyed in the reconstruction of the church.

02723-assumar.jpg	The rather flat ceiling is decorated by a painted, illusionistic architecture. The architectural details are painted in extreme foreshortening.Above the oval main room of the monastery church, a broad concave moulding marks the transition to a domed ceiling. The vaulting opens up into a diadem borne by angels, reiterating the oval ground-plan. Illuminated by invisible windows, we see the saints of the Benedictine order in all the glory of the heavens.It is quite impossible for the spectator to see that this domed setting is actually flat, and that the whole work is not, as is so often claimed, a domed ceiling fresco. By creating a transition from oval to circle, Asam is able to interweave the clouds amongst the pillars so that they help to conceal the base of the (painted) round temple on the oval ceiling aperture. A more intense metaphor for the heavens as a domed and pillared temple borne on clouds can hardly be imagined.On the main side of the fresco we see St George with his eyes raised towards Mary as she is carried upwards to Christ and God, who is holding a crown above the starry nimbus around her head. It is the triumph of the church that is displayed here against the golden background bathed in light, and its effect is all the more overwhelming because Asam has made the architecture his accomplice in illusion

14713-08elliot.jpg	Thomas Gainsborough rivaled Sir Joshua Reynolds as the leading portrait painter of 18th-century England. He publicly stylised his opposition in art-theoretical questions, but remained in a good working relationship with Reynolds. Gainsborough had begun his career as a provincial painter in Suffolk by copying landscapes and portraying the landed gentry. From 1759 to 1774 he worked in the society resort of Bath, where a high-ranking, increasingly enthusiastic clientele gave him well-paid commissions. In 1768 Gainsborough was one of the founder-members of the Royal Academy of Arts, and the only portraitist who was not based in London.

36791-edward6.jpg	This is the official full-length portrait of Edward VI after his coronation.Guillaume Scrots, as court painter to Henry VIII's son and successor, Edward VI, was responsible for the design of the most important official portrait of Edward as king, of which the present painting is one of the rare extant examples. This full length portrait of Edward depicts the young king at about the age of fifteen and not long before his untimely death from consumption in 1553.Edward VI (1537-1553) was the only son of King Henry VIII, by his third wife, Jane Seymour, and just nine years old when he succeeded to the throne. As he matured, Edward developed a deep interest in religious policy and his reign, although brief, is important as it marked a continuation and consolidation of the English Reformation, something which his sister Mary, who succeeded him as Queen of England, was unable to reverse.

Theophilus was very interested and told Paul that he would have Peter released immediately if he were able to resurrect his son, who had died fourteen years previously.For a long time the fresco was attributed to Masaccio.

36866-pentapt2.jpg	This panel belonged to a now dismembered pentaptych (five-paneled altarpiece). In its original configuration, St Benedict was the left, St Silvester Gozzolini the right and the Madonna and Child the centre panels (all in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The centre panel was flanked by panels depicting St John the Baptist (Perkins Collection, Sacro Convento di San Francesco, Assisi), and St John the Evangelist (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).When intact, the altarpiece would have resembled Duccio's polyptych in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena (the so-called polyptych 47). The pairing of Sts John the Baptist and John the Evangelist - the forerunner of Christ and the beloved disciple - to either side of the Madonna and Child is not uncommon and may relate either to the dedication of the chapel or to the name of the patron. On the other hand, the presence of Sts Benedict (c. 480&#150;543) and Silvester Gozzolini (1177&#150;1267) virtually assures that the altarpiece was painted for a monastery of the Silvestrine order, which was founded by Silvester in 1231 and followed the rule of St Benedict

15187-judit.jpg	As with much of Artemisia Gentileschi's work, scholars have tried to explain the hair-raising Judith Beheading Holofernes as a personal reaction to her 'date-rape' trial of 1612, but, in truth, her point of departure was far more visual than psychological. Her primary source was undoubtedly Caravaggio's Judith (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome) from some ten years earlier. The intense violence of the slaying, the lack of decorative details and even Judith's stiff parallel arms are all reliant on Caravaggio. Artemisia probably also knew Adam Elsheimer's Judith Beheading Holofernes (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), which was owned by Rubens. Elsheimer's small copper may have influenced the position of Holofernes' body and legs, although it should be noted that Artemisia's canvas has been cut down on the left and his legs are now missing. Other expressive and compositional elements can be related to the work of her father Orazio, especially his Judith and Her Maidservant (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford). The youthful appearance and important co-conspiratorial role given to the maidservant Abra as well as the triangular structure are derived from Orazio's Hartford canvas.Artemisia's Judith has such close affinities with her father's work that a number of scholars have argued for Orazio's authorship. It has been suggested that Artemisia's Judith Beheading Holofernes (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) was essentially a fancy-dress copy of her father's earlier work and not an independent rethinking of the Naples composition. X-radiographs of the Naples picture reveal a substantial number of changes, which make it highly unlikely that the picture was a repetition of another composition. Furthermore, the quality of the execution is not high enough to be that of Orazio; nor did Orazio ever seek this level of brutal directness. The simplification of the drapery and lack of decorative embellishment are consistent with other pictures painted during Artemisia's first Roman period. A number of copies show the composition before it was cut down. A small one on touchstone (Quadreria Arcivescovile, Milan) is paired with a version of Orazio's David Contemplating the Head of Goliath (Galleria Spada, Rome). This may imply that both originals were in the same collection and that both were by Orazio, but it could also mean that the patron wanted a 'diptych' by father and daughter.

20762-oranje.jpg	At Frederik Hendrik's death in 1674, his widow, Amalia von Solms, conceived a new plan to honour the life, deeds, and memory of her late husband in the Oranjezaal in her own new palace Huis ten Bosch. Constantijn Huygens would serve as adviser, and Jacob van Campen was commissioned to oversee the execution of the painted decoration. The decorations cover the walls of the cross-shaped central hall with chamfered inner corners from floor to ceiling and were executed by Pieter de Grebber, Salomon de Bray, Caesar van Everdingen, Pieter Soutman, Gerrit van Honthorst, and Jacob van Campen himself. In addition to these Northern Netherlandish artists, several Southern Netherlandish painters were also retained, including Jacob Jordaens, who completed the largest canvas in 1652, Triumph of Frederik Hendrik, and Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert and Theodoor van Thulden. With its programmatic mixture of mythology, allegory, and actual historical events, the cycle recalls the glorifying decorative programs that Rubens had painted for the Spanish, French, and English courts.The picture shows the wall of the Oranjezaal with Jacob Jordaens's Triumph of Frederik Hendrik

36957-xcircus1.jpg	In the mid-1880 the depiction of suburban pleasures favoured by the Impressionists gave way to pictures of urban entertainment, as writers, poets, and songwriters turned to acrobats, clowns, and caf� singers for subject matter. Seurat's interest in urban entertainment culminated in Circus Sideshow. The scene is a sideshow given in the evening on the street to lure passersby into purchasing tickets to the circus. But instead of being gay and festive, the performance is calm and brooding. Using a fine brush, Seurat has covered the canvas with a myriad of dark violet-blue, orange, and green dots of paint. Although his research in optics was purportedly scientific, the forms are endowed with mystery. Figures seem to levitate in the moody gaslight, musicians and performers are eerily geometric and alienated from the audience, and railings suggest ramps that lead nowhere. In this world where nothing is certain to the eye, Seurat implies a parity between fact and fantasy.Circus Sideshow represents the first important painting Seurat devoted to a scene of popular entertainment. In effect, it sets the stage for his last great figure compositions, La Chahut of 1889&#150;90 (Kr�ller-M�ller Museum, Otterlo) and Circus of 1890&#150;91 (Mus�e d'Orsay, Paris)

29296-304muril.jpg	Traces of Murillo's knowledge of northern painting are evident in his genre paintings. These enchanting pictures seemingly appear out of nowhere; they are without precedent in Spanish painting. Scenes of everyday life were a staple in the repertory of Dutch and Flemish painters, and were certainly familiar Murillo's merchant clientele. Murillo's genre paintings - there are about twenty in existence - are innocent and even incongruously poetic, given the impoverished condition of the subjects - usually young boys and girls wearing tattered, old clothing. For the most part, the composition follows a pattern: two or three figures are involved in an idle pastime, such as playing games or eating bread, fruit, or sweet confections. In the background there are vaguely defined ruins and one or two notional landscape motifs, all bathed in soft light and enveloped in hazy clouds.The best evidence that Murillo knew northern genre paintings is found in the works themselves. Although the precise compositional type is unique to Murillo, the constituent parts are often encountered in northern painting, especially in the paintings of the Bamboccianti. The motifs in the Young Boys Playing Dice - the boys in ragged clothes playing simple games in the open air, the irregular architectural forms, and the poetic landscape with delicately tinted clouds - can be compared with the motifs found in the paintings of the Bamboccianti. Murillo subordinates the landscape to the figures and infuses a stronger sentiment into is subjects

39441-5maggio0.jpg	The present decoration of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Palazzo Ducale was realized after the disastrous fire of 1577 during which all the structures of the ship's-keel Gothic ceiling and the wall-paintings were destroyed. An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings. The canvases were dedicated, thematically, to the Glorification of Venice, in remembrance of the numerous military undertakings in the East or on the mainland by the Venetian ground troops. On the ceiling great importance was given to the victories of the Venetian army in conquering the mainland; along the wall to the dispute between Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa, who reached an agreement in Venice with the political mediation of Doge Sebastiano Ziani; and to the events of the Fourth Crusade, led by Doge Enrico Dandolo in the early years of the 13th century.Tintoretto's Defence of Brescia is one of the thirty five panels on the ceiling of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio

07157-canal107.jpg	Piazza San Marco, looking toward the basilica of the same name, is undoubtedly the most popular and most frequently illustrated Venetian cityscape. San Marco is the main church of the city and the Piazza its central open space, on which the chief government buildings are located: on the left of the painting the Procuratie Vecchie and on the right the Procuratie Nuove, with the adjacent Campanile, the bell-tower of the basilica.The exhibited canvas is one of Canaletto's earliest town views, but even in this youthful work his mastery of topography is manifest &#151; all the more so since it involves in this case a most conventional scene, with an uncommonly modest figuration. Like his predecessors, Canaletto chose a central, fairly high point of view, as if the spectator were looking with him through the small hole of a peep-box. However, since the obviously accentuated gutters on the square are parallel to one another whereas the two Procuratie are not, there is a tension to the perspective that breaks the classic peep-box construction. The same can be said of the powerful vertical lines of the Campanile, which fastens, as it were, the entire composition securely on to the upper edge of the canvas. In the best baroque tradition, moreover, Canaletto manipulates the shadows in order to achieve a sense of depth and to arrange the composition, consciously omitting the shadow normally cast by the Campanile at this time of day.From all this it is clear that Canaletto was trained in stage decoration in the tradition of baroque perspective painting. Nonetheless, the open construction, the loose but powerful handling of the brush and the warm colours make it clear that he was also inspired by the 'natural' stage decoration and paintings of Marco Ricci, which were considered the height of modernity at the time.The painting is part of a series of four vedute, the earliest known vedute by Canaletto's hand. (Now two are in the Thyssen collection and two in the Museo del Settecento in Venice). Most likely the series was painted for a local patron, to decorate the walls of a portego, or central hall, in a palazzo.This hypothesis is supported not only by the large size of the four canvases, the broad plan of their compositions and the rather loose brushwork, but also by the combination of the chosen subjects. The identity of the patron is not known.

21016-cloeck.jpg	In this painting de Keyser follows the Amsterdam tradition of showing civic guards standing full-length that was established by Cornelis Ketel in the previous century (1588). De Keyser accentuated the middle group by placing it in front of the other guardsmen, who are on different levels and appear to be on the way to join their officers. Nevertheless, the result is not very satisfactory. There is no indication of a unity between the sixteen figures, and de Keyser's attempt to combine a horizontal setting with the effect of depth by placing symmetrical groups at various distances fails by its stiffness.The painting was commissioned by the guards for the Kloveniersdoelen, where it was mounted with other group portraits of Amsterdam civic guard companies that used the building. Rembrandt's Nightwatch was hung there a decade later

26112-32virgin.jpg	Three other variations of this Virgin and Child type appear in Memling's oeuvre. It is based on an invention of Rogier van der Weyden. The composition itself is most closely related to the Virgin Enthroned in Berlin, which also takes place in a room with two windows and a stone throne with volute armrests. The throne in St Osyth is not, however, white but amber coloured and is profusely decorated with tracery, foliage and trails, and little sculptures in white stone. The sculpture that tops the throne represents the archangel expelling Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. The link with the Incarnation as the work's principal theme is clear. Recent cleaning showed the painting to be less damaged than had initially been feared, and uncovered the uppermost part of the house that can be made out hazily through the stained glass of the right window. The style matches that of Memling's later works, produced from the end of the 1480s onwards

19244-stillif3.jpg	The main subject, a large glass vase of flowers, is accompanied by a smaller glass vase with pink roses on the uppermost surface. The larger vase of flowers presides over two artichoke heads and their leaves, the contrast between these two faces of Nature being intentional; the beauty of the flowers is enhanced by the presence of the more commonplace green vegetable below them, and the senses of sight and smell are pitted against the sense of taste. Van der Hamen has given the same painterly attention to all of the motifs, however, drawing and modelling the leaves of the artichokes with as much attention to detail as the blooms themselves. The flowers are painted with the artist's customary finesse; each bloom is carefully painted and the rose petals are modelled using thin glazes of red lake over white.One of the features of Van der Hamen's still-life painting for which he was best known lay in the depiction of expensive luxury glassware, such as the pieces represented here

42263-0507vela.jpg	"Together with four more equestrian portraits painted or partly over-painted by Vel�zquez (Philip III, Queen Margarita, Isabella of Borbon, Philip IV), a cycle of 13 battle scenes by Caj�s, Velazqu�z, Maino, Zurbar�n, Carducho, Castello, Jusepe Leonardo, and Pereda, and a series of the Labours of Hercules by Zurbar�n, this picture was an element of the colossal decorative scheme of the Hall of the Realms in the Buen Retiro Palace. The scheme was organized by the Count-Duke of Olivares, with the aim of affirming the glory of the Spanish Monarchy during what was in fact a period of decline.Among the five equestrian portraits, only the portraits of Philip IV and Prince Baltasar Carlos are entirely by Vel�zquez's own hand. The other three are by unknown painters and retouched by Vel�zquez and assistants.The portrait of Prince Baltasar Carlos, though highly conventional, is painted by Vel�zquez with his usual conviction, and with brilliantly suggestive strokes of impasto. Highlights applied with masterly skill emphasize the flowing contours around the prince's face, which is bathed in light and appears translucent, as if in a pastel. Even the shadows cast by the brim of his hat are transparent. The gold embroidery of the Infante's green costume stands out in attractive contrast, emphasizing the brilliant blond of the child's hair.In the field of royal portraiture, the portrait of the infant or child ruler poses a particular problem to the artist. A majestic pose, sumptuous clothing and the traditional outward trappings of dignity inevitably clash with the very nature of childhood. Vel�zquez solves this problem by placing the child on a sturdy horse so that the little figure is raised, as on a monumental plinth, to the ""correct"" position in the picture. This view is further vindicated by a sweeping landscape whose unspoilt nature creates an uncontrived link with the serious, yet still softly contoured and unspoilt mien of the child's face"

20862-nautilus.jpg	One of the most characteristic types of painting in Holland in the seventeenth century was still-life which was brought to a higher level of refinement there than anywhere else in Europe. Some still-lifes have symbolic meanings - the vanity of earthly wealth - but others, including those of the greatest practitioner of this genre, Willem Kalf, seem to be simply pronkstilleven, lavish displays of ceramics, glassware, gold and silver vessels as well as exotic food. They reflect a new willingness of rich Dutchmen to parade their possessions, an attitude which would have been frowned upon by an earlier, more puritanical generation.Kalf was born in Rotterdam and probably trained in the studio of Fran�ois Ryckhals in Middelburg, a town with a long established tradition of still-life painting. Subsequently he lived for some years in Paris where he met Flemish still-life artists, whose painterly style softened the linearity of Kalf's earliest manner. Kalf returned to Rotterdam but settled in Amsterdam in 1653 with his wife Cornelia Pluvier, a distinguished glassengraver, poetess and musician. In the following year Kalf was praised by the poet Jan Vos as one of the city's leading painters: he was much sought after by prosperous citizens anxious to record their treasures. This particular painting includes a richly decorated nautilus cup and a Wan-Li bowl, which were no doubt prized possessions of the unknown Amsterdammer who commissioned the still-life

As its first president since its foundation in 1768, he was knighted in 1769. Sir Joshua tirelessly promoted a higher status for the portrait as a genre to compete with history painting. His total of fifteen Discourses on Art began in 1769 as addresses delivered at the Academy's award ceremonies and continued until 1790.As early as 1779 the first eight Discourses appeared in book form, and made art a topic of public discussion. The portrait was, for Reynolds, the expression of the ""grand style"" when it was based on artistic exemplars. The depiction of the person should, he said, be subordinated to a ""general idea"", and the ""effect"" too should be of ""general"" validity. For Reynolds, a favoured compositional means was the borrowing of figural motifs from the store of classical and modern art. The ""borrowed attitudes"" were intended to ennoble the sitter and distinguish the artist as a master who had studied the great works of the past and reinterpreted their inventions"

21645-rinaldo.jpg	The subject was inspired by the 16th-century epic poem 'Gerusalemme Liberata' (Jerusalem Delivered) by Torquato Tasso (1544-1595). Rinaldo and Armida are a pair of lovers in the poem which is an idealized account of the first Crusade which ended with the capture of Jerusalem in 1099 and the establishment of a Christian kingdom. Armida, a beautiful virgin witch, had been sent by Satan (whose aid the Saracens had enlisted0 to bring about the Crusaders' undoing by sorcery. She sought revenge on the Christian prince Rinaldo after he had rescued his companions whom she had changed into monsters. The pastoral story of hate turned of love, of the lovers' dalliance in Armida's magic kingdom, and Rinaldo's final desertion of her, forms a sequence of themes that were widely popular with Italian and French artists in the 17th and 18th centuries.

40874-00deposi.jpg	With the body of Christ still on the Cross high above the scene, this picture, presumably painted in Brussels, shows the Deposition in a more traditional way than Rogier's famous version (Prado, Madrid). On the right are the centurion who recognized the Son of God, and his followers; it is not clear which of the two figures in the foreground is actually the centurion, since they are both making gestures that would be suitable for him.The artist who painted this small Deposition used figures from Rogier van der Weyden's great painting for the body of Christ and for Nicodemus, and drawing on other works by Rogier van der Weyden and by the Master of Fl�malle for the remaining figures. The group of the Virgin and St John, for instance, was taken from the Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp). However, the painter of this Deposition fails to unite the groups of figures successfully.The small panel of the Deposition, certainly not painted before the middle of the century, seems to have found its way quite early to southern Germany, where parts of it were already being copied in 1465 (Hof Altarpiece by Hans Pleydenwurff in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich). Like the composition of the Descent from the Cross, probably of roughly the same date, it is a relatively early example of the work of independent artists who picked up ideas from Rogier, imitating his style as best they could

08583-4bather3.jpg	C�zanne painted three large versions of the female bathers, all during the last seven years of his life. The version in Philadelphia is the largest. This was the first time that C�zanne had painted such a monumental canvas. Two other versions are in The Barnes Foundation, Merion, and in the National Gallery, London.The figures in all three compositions are remarkably simply and coarsely painted. The female creatures frolicking on the riverbank are not graceful, rather they are sturdy, angular, oddly proportioned and plump, and have nothing erotic about them. C�zanne avoided any suggestion of individuality and instead has generalised the figures in the same way as the landscapes, so that both have equal artistic weight.In the Philadelphia version, C�zanne has focused on the trunks which bear the weight of the trees. These create a framework which is both static and dynamic. The figures are also aligned in the same way as the trees; this is probably most apparent  in the female figure on the far left, whose upper body and left leg are inclined at exactly the same angle as the tree trunk. However, the contours and arms of the other figures also echo the geometry of the framework.C�zanne spent more than seven years working on this version. The strict triangular composition makes it the most classical of this series

39321-3pilate.jpg	Tintoretto decorated the walls of the Sala dell'Albergo by paintings showing important moments from the Passion of Christ and he finished them in the early months of 1567.The most admired has always been Christ before Pilate. Perhaps while painting it Tintoretto partially kept in mind one of the wood-engravings by Albrecht D�rer, evidence of the lasting spell held by German graphics of the first half of the 16th century over the imagination of the protagonists of Venetian Mannerist interpretations. The dramatic staging of the scene is however completely original. In a very fine and measured luministic web the figure of Christ, wrapped in a white mantle, stands out like a shining blade against the crowd and the architectural scenery. He is centred by a bright ray of light and stands tall in front of the hypocritically bureaucratic judge that is Pilate who is portrayed in red robes and as if sunk in shadows. Certainly taking up the idea of Carpaccio in his St Ursula cycle, Tintoretto portraits the old secretary at the foot of Pilate's throne. He leans against a stool covered with dark green cloth and with great diligent enthusiasm notes down every moment, every word spoken by the judge amid the murmurings of the pitiless crowd which obstinately clamours for the death of Christ.Remark to Hungarian visitors: the famous painting of Mih�ly Munk�csy depicting the same subject was undoubtedly and strongly influenced by the composition of this painting

11274-208delac.jpg	The Liberty Leading the People is a sort of epic narrative of the woman who quits her hearth to espouse a great cause. There is a carpet of bodies beneath her feet as she leads the ravening crowd. Her naked breasts have come to embody the social virtues of Republicanism, a point officially acknowledged by the generous diffusion of the image in the form of French stamps. It is also the first modern political composition. It marks the moment at which Romanticism abandoned its classical sources of inspiration to take up an emphatic role in contemporary life. Delacroix enrolled as a garde national, and in this role he portrayed himself, wearing a top hat, to the left of Liberty. The young drummer brandishing his pistols to the right of Liberty was, perhaps, the inspiration for the character Gavroche, in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, written thirty years later. Delacroix's influences - Goya, Gros, and, above all, G�ricault - are clearly apparent.

38483-jerome.jpg	The pendant of this painting, representing St John the Baptist, is  in a private collection in England. These paintings bear striking witness to the painter's long sojourn in central-southern Italy, and ability to assimilate what he saw there. Tanzio's Jerome seems to evoke the realism of the Neapolitan school as seen in Ribera and Battistello. The Vanitas still-life in the foreground is a masterpiece of Spanish-Neapolitan intensity: the beautifully silken light strikes golden reflections onto the book, resting wide open on the round skull in an almost caressing position, protecting it with its cast shadow. The saint's hand exhibits the bony leanness of a hermit, and the motif of the dirty fingernails evokes Caravaggio

29276-209muril.jpg	"Murillo finished the paintings commissioned for Santa Mar�a Blanca in Seville in 1665. The commission consisted of four paintings, two in the arched spaces  beneath the small dome of the nave and two more in the same format  placed at the head of the aisles. The nave paintings represent the pious legend of the founding of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, the mother church of Santa Mar�a Blanca. According to this story, a Roman patrician, John, and his wife had pledged their wealth to the Virgin. She rewarded their piety by appearing in a dream and instructed them to build a church in her name on the Esquiline Hill, in accordance with a plan that would be traced on the surface of a miraculous summertime snowfall. The couple rushed to report their vision to Pope Liberius (352-366), who had also been visited by the Virgin, and all proceeded to the designated place, where they witnessed the miraculous fall of snow. Following the heaven-sent plan, they built the church and named it Santa Maria della Neve, the Italian word for ""snow,"" which coincides with the name of the Sevillian canon, Justino de Neve (1625-1685), who was one of Murillo's principal patrons and who commissioned the redecoration of the Santa Mar�a Blanca, originally a synagogue and later converted into a church.In the two lunettes dedicated to this story (Dream of Patrician John and Patrician John Reveals his Dream to Pope Liberius, both in the Prado, Madrid), Murillo intensified the sketchy, sfumato technique first used in the Birth of the Virgin (Louvre, Paris). The consonance between the gentle narrative and the warm, intimate style seems effortless, so much so that it is easy to overlook the confident artistry of the complicated poses and the dextrous brushwork in the background"

33960-sl_putto.jpg	"The tale behind this little masterpiece comes down to us from the account of Chantelou (1665), who repeats it as a story told to him by Bernini. Apparently, Guido Reni was called to Rome to carry out a fresco either in the Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano or that of Santa Maria Maggiore, but found himself out of practice in the fresco medium. To practice his technique, he had a little base of mortar prepared for him, and in the presence of Cardinal Francesco Barberini painted the sleeping putto - a work that shows incredible freshness - before the base even had the time to dry. The little fresco passed into the collection of Francesco Barberini in January of 1629.Formerly it was held that the fresco project to which Bernini refers must be the decoration of the Cappella Paolina in S. Maria Maggiore (c. 1610). This early date is incongruous with the story, however, for in 1610 Francesco Barberini was only thirteen and had not yet moved to Rome. Bernini himself was evidently not certain for what fresco commission Reni prepared this practice sketch. According to him the work requested of Reni was instead the fresco of Attila in St. Peter's Basilica, for which the artist was called to Rome from Bologna in 1627.

36205-preachin.jpg	On 20 May 1444 the celebrated Sienese Franciscan friar Bernardino Albizzeschi died in Aquila. Although unable to secure his physical remains, the Sienese government and the local Franciscan Observants immediately mounted an energetic campaign to have him recognised as a saint. On 7 June the prior and councillors of the Compagnia della Vergine were authorised to spend as much money as they deemed necessary for an image to celebrate the memory of Bernardino. The commission was given to Sano di Pietro on 28 May 1445.The three principal panels of this altarpiece are now on display in the cathedral museum. They show the saint ascending into heaven, preaching outside San Francesco in Siena and preaching in the Campo. A plausible reconstruction of the altarpiece suggests that the three paintings once formed a triptych with the two portrayals of Bernardino's power as a preacher both framing and, through the emphatic diagonals of their compositions, focussing on the central image of Bernardino himself. Sano di Pietro represented the gaunt face of the saint in a particularly effective manner, with details that were almost certainly taken from Bernardino's own death mask and which appear consistently in later painted and sculpted representations of him.Sano di Pietro's other major achievement in this altarpiece was to represent, in graphic detail, one of the principal reasons why Bernardino was revered by the Sienese. He painted two highly descriptive scenes of the saint preaching in immediately recognisable locations in Siena itself (which also show how men and women were strictly segregated at these events). Each preaching scene alludes to a particular religious cult for which Bernardino was famed. Thus in the San Francesco scene Bernardino appears in the pulpit with a crucifix, as a reminder of his devotion towards the crucified Christ. In the Campo scene, meanwhile, he holds up the IHS monogram (an abbreviation of the Greek word for Jesus), a symbol that Bernardino made famous across Italy in his preaching

33458-21oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 525.Although he was an infinitely skilful and perceptive portraitist, Rembrandt always thought of himself in the first place as a history painter, that is, a painter of scenes from the Bible, classical history and mythology. This painting of 1656 is one of Rembrandt's greatest achievements as a history painter.The subject is taken from the book of Genesis, chapter 48. The dying patriarch Jacob is shown blessing his grandsons Ephraim and Manasseh. Their father Joseph and his wife Asenath stand behind the children. Rather than blessing the eldest son, the dark Manasseh, with his right hand, Jacob gave his first blessing to the younger, the fair-haired Ephraim. Joseph thought that his father had made a mistake but Jacob replied 'I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a prophet, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.' It was later claimed by the early fathers of the church, notably Ambrose and Augustine, that Ephraim was the ancestor of the Christians and Manasseh of the Jews.In Rembrandt's version Jacob blesses Ephraim but there is no sign of Joseph's questioning of his father - indeed he steadies his father's hand and the presence of Asenath is not mentioned in the Biblical account. She is mentioned only once in the Bible (Genesis chapter 41, verse 45) but Rembrandt makes her a major figure of great dignity, balancing the two men on the left. She was Egyptian and wears a headdress of a late medieval Burgundian type which Rembrandt must have considered Egyptian in origin. The prime focus of the painting is, however, on the tender gesture of the aged patriarch as he blesses Ephraim, and Joseph's outstretched hand and kind smile as he assists his father. The central scene is broadly painted in delicate yellows, browns and reds with remarkable economy and precision. Rembrandt creates a mood which is both intimate and sacred, tender and solemn

29521-portrait.jpg	Unlike other Italian cities such as Florence and Mantua, there are relatively few surviving examples of fifteenth-century portraiture in Siena - a genre that was becoming popular elsewhere. The painting of a young woman, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, is one that does survive. It is still in a frame that is probably original. The identity of the sitter is unknown but the treatment of the subject is typical of portraits of young women at that date. Adopting a convention derived from Flemish portraiture, it shows her head and shoulders as if from relatively close quarters. Her physical proximity is enhanced by the distant view of a lake or river in the background and the feathery trees that frame her head. The viewer is thus encouraged to examine the features of the young woman in some detail and enjoy the texture and colour of her abundant golden hair and pale skin, the embroidery of her gown and the ropes of pearls and gems round her neck.The inscription on the lower edge of the painting where the letters OP and NER appear - is interpreted as an abbreviation of 'OPUS NEROCCIO' (the work of Neroccio). The Latin inscription is a testimony to the sitter's beauty.Reading the two letters in the lower left corner as AP (instead of OP) some critics assume that the sitter is Alessandra Piccolomini, the grandniece of Pope Pius II, AP being her initials

10481-the_flea.jpg	"Through the oiled paper in the window frame, a milky light falls into the humble servant's room. Clothing is scattered untidily on the floor and thrown over a roughly made bench. A few household objects and some washing on a bar hang against the bare brick wall, whose only remaining decoration consists of a few personal items. The pretty woman who lives in this room, a maid or servant girl, is sitting on the edge of the bed, dressed only in a shift. As she concentrates on her search for a flea that has probably hidden on her breast, she reveals her round knees, her plump arms and her well formed shoulder.The complete intimacy of this scene and the still-life of the utensils anticipates a theme that was to become typical of late 18th century taste: innocence glimpsed unawares. AIthough there are a number of allegorical reflections - the little dog at the end of the bed, the roses in the vase next to the cosmetic jar they nevertheless do not seriously mean to identify this girl with Venus. The ""keyhole perspective"" also leaves it up to the spectator to choose his or her own interpretation of the scene."

39439-4scrutin.jpg	The Sala dello Scrutinio (Voting Hall) is the second largest hall of the Doge's Palace. The balloting and secret votes of the magistracies and the doge took place in this hall with the very complicated systems that the Venetian Republic had created to avoid intrigues and subterfuge during the elections and, above all, to ensure that the vote could not be bought especially from the poor nobility in favour of its richer equivalent.The iconographic theme of the hall of the Sala dello Scrutinio was inspired by the Venetian naval victories on the Eastern seas shown in the numerous ceiling canvases depicting virtues and symbolic figures. Tintoretto's Conquest of Zara is on the right wall upon entering, and it depicts an event of the Fourth Crusade. The Fourth Crusade was the first act of an expedition that aimed at conquering the Holy Land. It ended up subduing the revolt of Zara against Venice and taking over the city of Constantinople after a terrible and systematic pillage. Baldwin of Flanders was elected the new Christian emperor. The Venetian fleet was led by the old but still energetic doge, Enrico Dandolo. The event took place between 1202 and 1204

09390-borghese.jpg	The ceiling fresco in the Sala di Udienza (audience room) in the ground floor of the Palazzo Borghese is a good example of the pictorial programs of ballrooms in private Roman palaces. It was painted by the Roman quadratura painter Ermenegildo Constantini in anticipation of a wedding on 1768. It presents an allegory on the house of Borghese and the arts that fully accords with the baroque formal idiom and iconographic repertoire. With its splendid materials and grandiose forms, this ceiling reaches the height of Roman opulence. Personifications of the arts and sciences stand out  against the gold background, while simulated reliefs and genii of fame in stucco frame the ceiling panel, which with its host putti and virtues celebrates the Borghese coat of arms. The shape of the frame alludes to Pietro da Cortona's ceiling in Santa Maria in Vallicella. This frame, especially characteristic of Rome, was popular both in sacred and secular contexts

The interior, considered a model of Baroque design, is filled with ornate chapels and gilded balustrades, dominated by the high altar, which combines a Gothic statue of the Virgin Mary dating from 1430 with Baroque additions (dating from about 1750) by Johann Joseph Christian (1706-1677). The elaborate frescoes are by Franz Joseph Spiegler, the stucco work by Johann Michael Feuchtmayer the Younger.A beam of merciful light originates from the Virgin Mary, being reflected by a mirror held by an angel, and finally reaching St Benedict of Nursia. From Benedict, knowledge rains to Benedictine monks that are known as ardent admirers of Mary (Bernard of Clairvaux, Ildephons of Toledo, Hermann of Reichenau) and on defenders of the Faith (St Jerome, Rupert of Salzburg, St Dominic). On top of the scene is God the Father. Around the central scene, places of Marian pilgrimage: Genazzano (with Pope Urbanus VIII, Fourviere near Lyon (with King Louis XI of France), Santiago de Compostela, Einsiedeln, and Alt�tting, plus King Istv�n I of Hungary who consecrates himself and his kingdom to Mary.The picture shows the ceiling painting in the former Benedictine abbey church

30230-02thepoo.jpg	St John's version (John 5:1-15) of the miracle of the healing of the paralytic lays the scene in Jerusalem at the pool of Bethesda. (According to Matthew, Mark and Luke it took place at Kapernaum.) The place was a resort of the sick since the waters were believed to have miraculous curative powers. It was said that from time to time an angel, traditionally the archangel Gabriel, came and disturbed the water and that the first person to enter it afterwards was healed. But the paralytic had never succeeded in being first. Christ came there and found him. He was ordered to take up his bed and walk and immediately found himself cured. John described it as 'a place with five colonnades', and therefore represented with some such architectural feature. Christ addressing the paralytic who lies at the edge of the pool. Others, sick and infirm crowd the scene.Palma's painting was clearly inspired by the great examples of sixteenth-century Venetian art and in particular by the works of Tintoretto. The composition is typical of Palma the Younger's mature style. Compositional flair, the employment of diagonal perspectives and rich colours almost obliterated by heavy shadow as well as the theatrical eloquence of the gestures and use of foreshortening are all typical characteristics of Palma the Younger's style of painting. When he managed to control all of them, as in this splendid example, he took post-Renaissance Venetian painting, generally considered a dismal period in art, to its highest degree of effectiveness and expression. When, on the other hand, the effects he used degenerated into repetitive formulas, seventeenth-century Venetian art very quickly became monotonous. This painting is a part of the Collezione Molinari Pradelli, the most extensive private collection of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century art in Italy

16468-2crucifi.jpg	Contemporary chronicles refer to a visit by Giotto to Rimini: he is said to have painted in the great Franciscan church there. Since this church was later turned into a burial church for Sigismondo Malatesta and his family, all early frescoes have been lost, apart from a few fragments which are similar to the art of Giotto. The Franciscan church , however, does contain a large painted crucifix, which probably belonged in this church from the beginning, and which, in Giotto's overall output, can be attributed to the same period in which he created the Louvre panels.This painting is a nobler version of the Santa Maria Novella Crucifix (also better preserved), already showing tendencies of the artist's mature treatment of the subject

29702-clearing.jpg	Around 1870, growing numbers of Scandinavian (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish) artists took to visiting Paris, the modern metropolis with its many-sided art scene. They attended the school of L�on Bonnat, or the Acad�mie Julian, or the Acad�mie Colarossi. Some of them were tutored by  Jean-L�on G�r�me. When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Gr�z-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods.In his first summer working at Gr�z, Nordstr�m was totally under the influence of the seventh Impressionist exhibition. A Clearing in the Woods at Gr�z does not seem fully committed to Impressionist technique,though; the filigree of the slender tree trunks retains a linear clarity. The leafage and ground, on the other hand, are a shimmering fabric of green, blue and ochre brush strokes such as might satisfy even the most orthodox Impressionists. The female figure near the point where the path vanishes may seem to have been positioned by chance, but in fact she has her specific spatial and narrative part to play in the overall composition

43242-distribu.jpg	A leading figure in the transition from Mannerist tradition to the new realism in genre painting was David Vinckboons, one of the most popular and prolific painters and print designers of his time. Good proof of Vinckboons' debt to Bruegel is the debate which scholars still hold about whether some pictures should be attributed to Pieter Brueghel the Younger, whose art was a shadow of his great father's, or to Vinckboons.Vinckboon's family had settled in Amsterdam by the time he was fifteen years old, and he apparently spent the rest of his life in Holland. His work  indicate that he had contact with Gillis van Coninxloo, the gifted Flemish landscape painter, who also emigrated to Amsterdam. Vinckboons was one of the artists who helped to forge the new landscape style, but toward the end of his career his interest in the activities of men and women increased. His genre pictures range from early multicoloured ones of large crowds strolling through gardens and Bruegel-like kermis scenes, to those made in the last years of his life which show a close view of a single couple in a landscape

24104-90trivul.jpg	This large altarpiece was commissioned for the Olivetan monks of the monastery of Santa Maria Organo, in Verona. The Olivetan monks are a reformed order of white Benedictines, which is why the founder of the order, St Benedict, is shown on the right-hand of the painting. Standing next to him, St Jerome is holding a model of a church: the monks had ordered this painting for their newly renovated and extended church. To the left, Gregory the Great can be seen, and at his side stands John the Baptist, who is pointing to the centre of the painting, directing our gaze to the Madonna and Child. Holding the Christ Child on her lap, Mary is hovering in a mandorla of angels.At the lower edge of the painting an angel is playing the organ, accompanied by two singing companions. The emblem  of the church of Santa Maria Organo includes an image of an organ, since the monks assumed that the name of the church was derived from  the musical instrument, though it was probably taken from the nearby  Porta Organa.

13901-stil_lif.jpg	The unadorned presentation and unpretentious simplicity of so many of Georg Flegel's still life paintings make him one of the most individual practioners of the art in the seventeenth century.  He was moreover one of the earliest still life painters, and he had a widespread influence on younger artists.  The contemplative character of his works, and their essential stillness, is remarkable when one considers that he was painting in the Protestant refuge of Hanau throughout the ravages of the Thirty Years War that caused so much destruction throughout most of Northern Europe, and it is tempting to see his work as an introverted  reaction to these horrifying contemporary events

17925-viewdord.jpg	Jan van Goyen painted between 1633 and 1655 over thirty views of Dordrecht, situated at the junction of the Maas, Waal and Rhine. The present painting is his only close-up view of the town from the north-east. Dominating the scene are the town's defensive bastions and the Grote Kerk with its massive, truncated tower and four-faced clock. A stiff breeze has whipped up the Maas into choppy peaks. Passengers in the foreground ferry, hunkered down against the wind, are all too familiar with this uncomfortable form of transport.

38711-concert1.jpg	The Concert is one of the last and most important works of Terbrugghen, who died in 1629, the same year he executed this extraordinary masterpiece. The representation of concerts with two or more figures was common in the work of Terbrugghen and in the Dutch School of painting in general: these northerners enhanced their own tradition by drawing new iconography from the Roman Caravaggesque school. Whether subtly or explicitly, these scenes of musicians almost invariably convey erotic and sensual meaning, even when they purport to depict biblical subjects.A key figure in the spread of the naturalistic style in Europe, Terbrugghen was active in Rome during the second decade of the seventeenth century. While there, he attached himself to the Caravaggesque style, experiencing it mostly through his own luminous and chromatic interpretations of the examples of Orazio Gentileschi and Carlo Saraceni. In the transparent and vibrant rapport between light and material, so characteristic to his style, we can recognize Terbrugghen as an important precedent for Jan Vermeer.

29715-cainabel.jpg	The catalogue number found at the bottom of the canvas allowed to identify this painting as the Cain and Abel that was in the Barberini collection in the nineteenth century. This canvas was attributed to Vouet. The old attribution held even after the acquisition of the painting by the state in 1981. A check of the seventeenth-century inventories of the Barberini collection reveals four pictures of the same subject: among these, the National Gallery painting can be identified with a canvas  cited (without the name of its author) in a 1655 inventory. The same inventory lists a pendant depicting Saint Sebastian cured by the Pious Women. As this painting has been convincingly attributed to Pietro Novelli, known as Il Monrealese, the discovery of the relationship between the two paintings has led to the attribution of the National Gallery picture to the same artist

43715-soupkitc.jpg	There was a severe food shortage in 1816 and 1817, and this brought poverty and hence social problems that the authorities could no longer cope with. The birth rate of illegitimate children rose drastically because most of the people were not by law permitted to marry owing to their financial circumstances. The number of orphans and semi-orphans with no parents to care for them also rose drastically. Against that background the charm with which Waldm�ller has invested his children here must be seen as glossing over reality. Only the realists of the following generation dared to represent conditions in their truly fearful state
