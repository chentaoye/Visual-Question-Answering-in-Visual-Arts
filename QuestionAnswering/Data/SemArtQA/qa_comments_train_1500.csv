18472-hermit.jpg	This moralizing genre painting is more overtly religious and Catholic than most of the artist's paintings. The scene is set in a rocky landscape, where the central figure, an elderly Capuchin friar, sits distributing rosaries to large group of girls and young women. The girls are bringing food to the hermit and, in return, he is giving them rosaries and votary medals, which he takes from a box held by a handsome young friar. The girls are dressed in ordinary gowns, apart from the two closest to the hermit who are all in white; they are receiving rosaries from him in preparation for their confirmation.The theme is one of charity, generosity and virtue: the young women are taking physical care of the hermit and he, in return, is giving them spiritual rewards

34652-labievre.jpg	Although it was primarily his classical landscapes which established Robert's reputation, Robert was also a faithful recorder of the topography of Paris. The Bi�vre was a small river which ran into the larger river Seine on Paris' left bank. Although no longer visible today, in Robert's day it was used for a variety of local industries, including textile dyers, distilleries, breweries, tanners, flour mills, a soap factory and twelve laundries. The quarter surrounding it was one of the poorest in Paris and notorious for its slums.The painting is signed and dated lower right: .H ROBERT: 1768.

44058-8ambierl.jpg	When Rogier died in Brussels on 18 June 1464, he was the best known and most sought after painter in the Netherlands, an exemplar to the majority of artists north of the Alps. He left behind him not only an obviously large workshop with extremely well trained assistants, but also a continuing demand for his work. The studio was very probably taken over by his son Pieter; it will have completed commissions on which he had embarked, also accepting new orders. One of these works, possibly commissioned in Rogier's own lifetime, consisted of the wing paintings for an altar in Ambierle in France, completed in 1466. It has been proved that the carved central shrine of this altar came from Brussels. The distinguished patrons in Brussels who commissioned it obviously turned to the town painter's famous workshop, where large and impressive paintings similar in typology to Rogier's own were produced, although certainly no longer by the master himself.The altar was donated by Michel de Chaugy, a counsellor of Philip the Good. The shrine in the retable shows carved scenes of the Passion; the donor's family, with its patron saints, occupies the wings. Stone figures of saints are depicted in niches on the exterior. In its construction, this work reflects the exterior of the Beaune Altarpiece

23694-recovery.jpg	In 1630 the count-duke of Olivares decided to initiate a lavish program of artistic display by the construction of a new pleasure palace on the eastern border of Madrid which came to be known as the Buen Retiro. Here theatrical plays and spectacles would be staged, tournaments and jousts would be organized, and painting, sculpture, and tapestry would be displayed. Beginning in 1630 with a modest renovation of the royal apartment in San Jer�nimo, the project was expanded in 1632 and again in 1633, culminating in a sizable complex of buildings surrounded by enormous gardens adorned by fountains, alleys and hermitage chapels. Once the structure was finished, Olivares faced with the mammoth problem of decorating the new palace, a problem that was solved by hundreds of pictures from Italy and Flanders and by commissioning as many works from local artists as they could paint. As for the works by royal artists and their disciples, the decoration of the Retiro was the major event of the 1630s and thus is a microcosm of court painting during the decade.The Hall of Realms was the principal ceremonial room in the Buen Retiro Palace. Spanish palace decoration during the reign of Philip IV tended to be loosely programmed in comparison with Italian examples. However, the paintings in the Hall of realms, executed in 1634-35, offer an exception to the rule, for her the count-duke Olivares and his advisers invented a coherent, if straightforward program designed to magnify the power of the Spanish monarchy.The principal element are twelve paintings of important military victories of Philip IV's reign, which demonstrate the invincibility of Spanish arms. These are complemented by ten scenes of the life of Hercules, who was claimed by the Spanish Habsburgs (and virtually every other ruling house of Europe) as the founding ancestor of the dynasty. The final component is a group of equestrian portraits  of Philip III and Margaret of Austria, Philip IV and Isabella of Bourbon, and the heir to the throne, Baltasar Carlos, which embodies the idea of dynastic legitimacy and succession. From the 27 paintings the largest share went to Francisco de Zurbar�n, who painted the Hercules scenes and the Defence of Cadiz. Vel�zquez obtained all five equestrian portraits and the Surrender of Breda. Vicente Carducho obtained the commission for three battle painting, while his pupil F�lix Castelo was awarded one. Eugenio Caj�s and his assistants and followers were given four subjects. The two remaining works fell into the hands of Juan Bautista Maino and Antonio de Pereda.In contrast with the formulaic treatment favoured by the other painters, Vel�zquez and Maino break fresh ground in their battle compositions, the Surrender of Breda and the Recapture of Bahia, which share a common premise by interpreting the clash of arms as a clash of emotions. Maino includes the count-duke's portrait to glorify the minister as the author of the victory. The wounded soldier evokes a Christian martyrdom in order to arouse admiration and compassion for those who risk their lives in defence of the monarchy. The Recapture of Bahia is painted in Maino's crisp, burnished manner, which he effortlessly revived for the occasion

39739-05organ.jpg	In the 1550s there were numerous versions of Titian's painting for Charles V. Most of the clients were members of the emperor's own immediate circle. This painting is a copy produced by Titian's workshop. While it reflects elements of Titian's manner of painting, such as the play of light on the materials and on the pearl necklace, the young man's head and the figure of Venus are clearly of inferior quality

The funerary monument to Willem I ('the Silent' ), Stadholder and Prince of Orange (1533-1584), was commissioned by the States General in 1614, and was designed and largely executed by the Amsterdam architect and sculptor Hendrick de Keyser the Elder before being completed by his son Pieter in 1622-3. It was erected in the choir of the Nieuwe Kerk and became a national shrine, regarded both as a national mounument to the New Republic and a symbol of liberty and independence.The painting is signed and dated lower right: H. van vliet/ Ao 1665

34975-4malles2.jpg	Quite close to M�stair in the Venosta region of south Tyrol lies the little town of Malles with its simple little Benedictine church. In the Carolingian era, this church and the one in nearby Grab�nden belonged together, the church of Malles being affiliated to that of M�stair.A series of paintings were executed in the church around 880, but all that remains in the apses are the figure of Christ standing, of St Stephen and of Gregory the Great. On the narrow strips  of masonry between the apses there is the figure of a priest accompanied by the noble donor, who offers a model of the church to God. Roman influence has been detected in these frescoes, but their execution and treatment of detail differs significantly from the style of the figures in the M�stair church

22589-5madchi.jpg	This early work by Filippo Lippi is the centre panel of a triptych, the wings of which are in the Accademia Albertina in Turin. Although made of three separate panels, the triptych was unified by a continuous wall and uniform lighting. The figures and the elaborate marble throne have a massive quality deriving from the artist's study of the frescoes of Masaccio in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine, where Lippi was a monk. The rose held by the Virgin symbolizes her purity. The book held by the infant Christ is inscribed with a passage from the book of Ecclesiastes 24:19

43643-oldwoman.jpg	Political transformations in 17th-century Holland produced new art customers - ordinary townspeople whose tastes prompted artists to look closely at simple subjects - and a demand for small paintings to adorn middle-class houses. Among those artists who accommodated the new artistic audience was Jacobus Vrel, either a naive imitator of the Delft school or, as is suggested by some dated works, the inventor of the quiet domestic scene that the mid-17th-century genre school then took to perfection

08708-v_mercy.jpg	Of the two known authentic works of Charonton The Virgin of Mercy (Madone de Mis�ricorde) was commissioned by the royal physician Jean Cadard. It is a study for the great composition of the Coronation of the Virgin. St. John the Baptist and the kneeling donor, and St. John the Evangelist and the donor's wife, occupy the left and right hand sides of the composition. In the centre the Madonna, in a gold brocade robe, extends the protection of her blue mantle to the churchmen and laymen sheltering beneath it. When the painting was transferred from wood to canvas the golden background was somewhat damaged. The standing figures divide the composition into three vertical areas - the spaces between them being filled by the kneeling figures. The different sizes of the figures produce a well-balanced rhythm. The gentle charm of the faces and the serene mood of the whole give this picture a particular attraction

09753-1march.jpg	The Salone dei Mesi (Room of Months) in the Palazzo Schifanoia, one of the masterpieces of Italian palace architecture, was decorated with a series of allegorical frescoes symbolizing the months. The length of the room  is 24 m, the width 11 m and the height 7,5 m. The frescoes are attributed to Cosme Tura, Francesco del Cossa, Baldassare d'Este and Ercole de' Roberti. On the southern wall January and February, on the eastern wall March, April and May, on the north wall June, July, August and September, on the west wall October, November and December were represented. Due to negligence it was in a very bad state already in the 18th century. Today there remained only fragments of the frescoes on the southern and western walls, while those on the eastern wall and most on the northern are in relatively good condition. This means that the visitor can view the surviving allegories of seven months (March, April, May, June July, August and September). In all allegories the episodes are arranged in a three-tiered, frieze-like manner; in the upper sphere, the sphere of mythology, each month and its planet are paralleled by their ancient divinity in a triumphal procession. The middle layer shows the signs of the zodiac, while below are rendered the courtly events appropriate to the particular time of year.In the allegory of March the Triumph of Minerva is represented on the upper layer. In the centre of it there is the goddess, on the left a group of poets and magistrates, on the right women with symbols of feminine labour. The middle layer represents the zodiac sign Aries, while the lower layer depicts a hunting scene

31241-idealcit.jpg	"Piero gradually stopped painting almost twenty years before his death. Certainly one of the reasons would have been his ill health and his growing blindness; but it is also probable that he wanted to examine further the theories behind those laws of perspective and proportions that, with the addition of his original and inventive talent, had contributed to the creation of a modern art so different from his, Piero della Francesca responded with his treatises ""De Prospectiva pingendi"" and ""De Corporibus regularibus"", in which he analysed the theoretical and scientific foundations of his pictorial culture. It is from his drawings in De Prospectiva that the perspective construction of the panel so-called Ideal City, is born.

05053-fruitveg.jpg	This depiction of fruit and vegetables signed by Pietro Paolo Bonzi is the pendant of another signed painting also once in the Wetzlar collection. The pendants are two of the artist's three securely attributed still-lifes and as such form the cornerstone of our knowledge of Bonzi's oeuvre in this area and a point of departure for any further enlargement of it. His only other documented still-life is the famous decoration with swags of fruit, flowers and vegetables painted in the vault of the gallery of the Palazzo Mattei in Rome, which was commissioned by Asdrubale Mattei and executed with Pietro da Cortona in 1622-23. In May 1626, Marchese Mattei also commissioned two paintings with assorted fruit and five 'all different' flower paintings from Bonzi. In Asdrubale's 1638 posthumous inventory three paintings are listed as `birds by il Gobbo'. These and a few other documents attesting to his activity as a still-life painter reveal unequivocally that Bonzi was an artist who paid close attention to the natural world. His ability to render fruit in a naturalistic manner was transmitted directly to his only pupil named in the sources, Michelangelo Cerquozzi.Works such as Bonzi's Fruit, Vegetables and a Butterfly opened the path for Cerquozzi's luxuriant and exuberant baroque still-life paintings. The artichokes, celery, pears, melon, slice of water melon, bunch of red strawberries, cherries, peaches, hazelnuts and figs on a stem, plus the two bunches of precariously piled white grapes, justify Giovanni Baglione's statement that Bonzi, 'with his fruit caught the eye and deceived the spectator'. Here Bonzi's skill at optical illusion, his ability to outdo reality - the artichokes and figs would surely fall if gravity's laws were obeyed - are sustained by his artistic talent

17807-711goya.jpg	In many ways this version of a lunatic asylum is more conventional than Goya's earlier eye-witness account of The Yard of a Madhouse. It has been compared with Hogarth's scene in Bedlam in the Rake's Progress and some of Goya's deranged men, like Hogarth's, wear traditional attributes - a crown, a feathered headdress and tarot cards. But Goya's Bedlam is a much more horrifying sight, a place of darkness only partially lit, with the postures, gestures and expressions of the inmates indicating their pitiful condition. This is a dramatic and compassionate expression of the kind of scene he saw in Saragossa.Goya's life-long concern for the plight of the insane as well as of prisoners and his continued interest in the physiognomy of madness is evident from the many drawings he made of various conditions of insanity.

Nevertheless, the face is not finished, and it appears slightly flat, despite the vivaciousness of the eyes. The contrast of the colours of the clothing and beret (charcoal and black, respectively) against the green background elicits a remarkable effect. So does the gentle depiction of the face framed by soft, chestnut hair. The portrait, which can be considered typical of the era, can be dated accurately: a letter that D�rer sent at that time from Venice to Willibald Pirckheimer makes clear that it must have been carried out between 23 September 1506, and 23 October 1506, that is, after the Feast of the Rose Garlands (N�rodn� Galerie, Prague) and before the Madonna with the Siskin (Staatliche Museen, Berlin)

08822-joseph.jpg	"Joseph was the elder son of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob and of Rachel. His numerous older brothers were strictly only half-brothers, being the sons of Leah or of handmaidens. The events of his romantic life story have been depicted continuously in Christian art from the 6th century onwards. The medieval Church saw the episodes of his life as a prefiguration of the life of Christ, and it is to this that he owes his important place in Christian art.When in Egypt as a slave, Potiphar, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites and made him steward of his household (Gen. 39:7-20). Potiphar's wife 'cast her eyes over him and said, ""Come and lie with me.""' He refused her though she continued to press him. One day when they were alone together she clutched his robes, pleading with him to make love to her. At this, Joseph fled so precipitately that he left his cloak at her hands. When Potiphar came home she avenged her humiliation by accusing Joseph of trying to violate her, using the cloak as evidence. Joseph was promptly thrown into prison.The present work is an outstanding example of Cignani's intense artistic expression, impressive not only for its strongly emotional content, but also for the brilliance of its formal composition. Cignani painted this subject several times in his workshop, but only the Dresden version is acknowledged to be entirely his own work."

43003-6buckin2.jpg	In the last decade of his life Veronese painted a major cycle of religious pictures made up of ten oblong canvases of equal size inspired by stories from the Old and New Testament, known to scholars as the Duke of Buckingham series, after the name of the nobleman who owned them in the early seventeenth century. The canvases, now divided among the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, which has seven of them, the National Gallery in Washington (one) and the Narodni Galerie in Prague (two), were probably intended for a convent. They are the following: Lot and his Daughters Leaving Sodom, Hagar in the Wilderness, Rebecca at the Well, Susanna and the Elders, Esther and Ahasver, Adoration of the Shepherds, Christ and the Centurion, Christ and the Adulteress, Christ and the Woman of Samaria, and Christ Washing the Feet of the Disciples.The striking feature of the series, to which the canvas Susanna and the Elders belongs, is the unusual monumentality of the figures, most of them located in the foreground

03759-022pieta.jpg	"In Bellini's work the Piet&#224; of the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo and that of the Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan are the prototypes of a series of variants showing the body of the dead Christ over the sarcophagus, with his head bowed and his hands positioned as if for burial. This is an iconography that originated in Constantinople, even if in Italy it was thought to derive from a famous miraculous Roman mosaic-icon, the one of Santa Croce in Jerusalem, which according to legend had appeared during Mass to Pope Gregory the Great.The painting in the Museo Poldo-Pezzoli, stylistically very close to the Dead Christ representation in the Museo Correr in Venice, is signed as ""IOANNES BELLINVS"".

30643-snorbert.jpg	Marten Pepijn (also spelled Pepyn), an artist at Antwerp painted in a style faithful to the humanists of the preceding generation.St Norbert played a special part in Antwerp ecclesiastical history. In 1124 he overcame the heretic Tanchelm at Antwerp and made the chapel of Our Lady from which the Cathedral was to evolve, the city's parish church. As one might expect, the pious story does not tally entirely with historical reality. Norbert is customarily portrayed as an archbishop or abbot. His attribute is a monstrance containing the Host, as he defended the Eucharist against Tanchelm's disbelief.The saint is dressed here in the habit of the Norbertine or Premonstratensian Order, of which he was the founder. He kneels before a monstrance. A sanctuary lamp - an oil lamp that has to be kept burning by the Holy Sacrament (the consecrated wafers) - is suspended in front of a curtain.

19622-joseph.jpg	In the 1640s Herrera's production went into a decline, although he is known to have received the occasional commission from a religious order. St Joseph and the Christ Child, done for the monastery of San Jos� (Mercedarios Descalzos) in Seville in 1645, illustrates how the new devotional spirit was affecting Seville's monastic communities. Herrera made the necessary modifications to accommodate the new taste for quiet, sentimental art, but at the cost of the original rough-hewn realism that made him a distinctive painter.An earlier variant of the composition, signed and dated 1645, is in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest.

07223-canal511.jpg	The painting presents the view of the Grand Canal from the Chiesa degli Scalzi to the Fondamenta della Croce, with San Simeone Piccolo.The church of San Simeone Piccolo, at the left, was rebuilt between 1718 and 1738 after a design by the architect Scalfarotto. It is depicted here completed, hence the dating of the painting to about 1738. Canaletto had earlier painted other versions of the same composition, including a picture in the Royal Collection which was engraved by Visentini as part of the Prospectus Magni Canalis series of prints.This view of the upper reaches of the Grand Canal is now considerably altered by the city's modern railway station which dominates and disrupts its right side. The artist has depicted some craft plying their way across the canal, including a passenger barge at the left, but the scene is a relatively peaceful one. He seems to have been particularly preoccupied with the gently distorted mirror-image of the buildings reflected on the surface of the water

07704-2annunc2.jpg	This painting originally was ascribed to Fra Filippo Lippi. In fact the composition was inspired by two of Lippi's altarpieces, an Annunciation in San Lorenzo, Florence, and another  Munich. From the first of these derive the pose and upward gaze of the angel, the solid haloes with channeling, and the steep perspective of the buildings terminating in a salmon-coloured wall with an open door. From the second, Fra Carnevale has taken the modest stance and gesture of the Virgin.What is completely original to this depiction is the idea of staging the Annunciation in a street bordered by elegant colonnades rather than in the Virgin's bedroom, a cloister, an enclosed garden, or a church-like interior, as was traditional. The buildings, with their salmon and pink trim, are distinctly Florentine in style, although completely unlike those in Lippi's work. The ornamented arches of two of the buildings recall those in the background of Ghiberti's relief of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba on the Gates of Paradise of the Baptistery in Florence. The perspective system is rigorous: a pinhole indicating the vanishing point has been made in the right doorjamb, eight centimetres from the base of the door; virtually all of the orthogonals recede to this point

18856-ermina.jpg	The painting was commissioned in 1618 (significantly the date of the start of the Thirty Years War) by the famous mosaicist Marcello Provenzali da Cento, but was probably not finished by the painter until the following year. A seventeenth-century copy that is about ten centimetres wider, in a private collection in Paris in 1987, suggests that the left side of the painting, where the Parisian composition appears more developed, may have been cut off.According to Torquato Tasso's account in Gerusalemme Liberata (canto XIX, 104-14), Tancred, after being wounded by Argante during the siege of Jerusalem, is helped by Vafrino. On removing Tancred's armor and discovering his wounds, he tells Erminia. Erminia tends her lover's bloody wounds with the braided tresses of her own hair. The depiction of the subject was influenced by two famous Christian themes: The Lament over the Dead Christ and St Sebastian Tended by Pious Women.The monumental and animated drama of the composition, which seems to burst out of the confines of the frame, the strong contrasts of light and shade, the velvety colours, the highly original style, the ivory-tinted flesh tones, and the gamut of yellows, ochers, and oily gray-greens make this undoubted masterpiece, in which he meditates on the examples set by Bassano and Fetti, one of the artist's most outstanding works

She was married to a Hebrew immigrant in Moab and after his death left her native land and went with her mother-in-law Naomi, to Bethlehem. Here she was allowed to glean the corn in the fields belonging to Boaz, a rich farmer and kinsman of Naomi. Ruth, true to her nature, maintained, on Naomi's advice, a modest demeanour among the young men working at the harvest. One night she went and lay at the feet of Boaz as he slept in the field. By this act Boaz saw her virtue and later decided to assume responsibilities towards her of a kinsman. In due course he married her.

13310-13turban.jpg	Remarkable though it is, the description of the sitter - with the stubble on his chin prickly against the soft fur collar, and his bloodshot left eye - is less arresting than the depiction of his head-dress. Van Eyck is noted for the impassivity of his figures, and it is instructive to compare this portrait with that by the Master of Fl�malle (Robert Campin) of a man wearing a similar red hat. There, the scarf ends hang down, serving to frame a face in  which we read force of character and upon which we can project an inner emotional life. Van Eyck's personage gives much less away. A greater area of the picture is taken up by his red hat than by his face, its three-dimensional bulk is more assertive, it folds and tucks more dramatic. Perhaps the hat was studied at greater length, perhaps on a stand, independently of the sitter and, like a studio still-life, arranged by the painter, knotted and tweaked to present its most picturesque aspect.Van Eyck's ability to depict it in such a realistic manner relies greatly on his control of the oil medium, which unlike tempera enables him to represent dark shadows and paler highlights without losing the glowing overall red hue

15581-02madonn.jpg	"The painting depicting the Madonna enthroned with Saints was painted for the church of San Giusto.Altar paintings depicting the Virgin Mary and Christ together with several saints were common in Ghirlandaio's day. In Renaissance Italy, enthroned Madonnas, surrounded by saints, were extremely popular. In such a picture, which was called a Sacra Conversazione, or ""holy conversation"", it was possible to combine various saints in accordance with the requirements of the individual donors and church representatives. The donor's patron saint would, for example, be depicted next to the main patron saint of the church or altar, or the founder of an order. It is frequently possible to tell, by looking at the depicted saints, which church a painting was in and to which order the church belonged. The choice of saints could in effect be extended to include, for example, the patron saints of a town or guild.Two such works by Ghirlandaio are now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence . In both pictures the Christ Child is depicted in a similar posture, his hand raised in blessing. In the earlier painting with the tied back curtain, in Lucca Cathedral, Ghirlandaio depicted all the saints in a standing position. But in the later works the two saints at the front are kneeling. This makes a better use of the surface of the picture and at the same time achieves a more interesting arrangement of figures by creating a pyramidal composition formed by the kneeling saints and the Madonna. The panels in the Uffizi are filled with decorative accessories, such as the carpets on the steps leading up to the throne and the flower vases, and these were surely influenced by Flemish works. The depictions of the Madonna are, however, still in keeping with Verrocchio's models.The picture is composed in a strictly symmetrical manner. The archangel Michael in shining armor is similar to St Julian in Ghirlandaio's earliest Sacra Conversazione in Sant' Andrea a Brozzi. The trees are a quotation of the Last Supper in Ognissanti, and the carpet is similar to the table covering in the Ognissanti St Jerome"

33438-04oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 604.After his initial training in his native town of Leiden, Rembrandt spent a short but crucially important period in the studio of the history painter Pieter Lastman in Amsterdam. He then returned to Leiden and set up as an independent painter in 1625. He worked in the town for about six years until settling permanently in Amsterdam. Rembrandt's early work shows the powerful influence of Lastman's broad, colourful style, as can be seen, for example, in the Tobit and Anna of 1626.This well-preserved painting is one of the finest works of Rembrandt's Leiden period. For many years it was incorrectly identified but it certainly shows Jeremiah; who had prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem, capital of Judah, by Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah, chapters 32, 33), lamenting over the destruction of the city. In the distance on the left a man at the top of the steps holds clenched fists to his eyes: this is the last king of Judah, Zedekiah, who was blinded by Nebuchadnezzar. The prominent domed building in the background is probably Solomon's Temple.Jeremiah's pose, his head supported by his hand, is a traditional attitude of melancholy: his elbow rests on a large book which is inscribed 'Bibel' on the edge of the pages, probably a much later addition to the painting. The book is presumably meant to be his own Book of Jeremiah or the Book of Lamentations. The lighting of the figure is particularly effective with the foreground and the right side of the prophet's face in shadow and his robe outlined against the rock. Rembrandt has used the blunt end of his brush to scratch details of the foliage, Jeremiah's beard and the fastenings of his tunic in the wet paint, a characteristic technique of his early years.

Almost everything he produced was for private collectors and, with only a few exceptions, his canvases were not very large. He studied under Massimo Stanzione and showed keen artistic intelligence in the way he interpreted the developments that took place in Naples and Rome after Caravaggio's death. Cavallino's lively and nervous brushwork was shot through by flickering light. In him, Caravaggio's naturalism blended together with an almost classical interest in pose and compositional structure.

03409-03calvar.jpg	Much of the impact of the composition derives from its dynamic organisation along the main diagonals. We 'enter' the scene from the bottom right corner, where Saint Veronica in her Venetian gown strains forward to wipe the sweat and blood off Christ's face; follow the lines of the wooden upright of the cross, Christ's body collapsed under the weight, the tormentor's brutal blows, to the furthest point in the upper left, where the executioner pulls on the rope around Christ's waist, urging him on to Golgotha in the distance. His windblown cloak picks up the red of Veronica's dress. Alternatively, we can scan the picture from upper right, from the mounted officers pointing to and discussing the events below; follow the wooden lance shaft to where John's green cloak, seized by a soldier, seems to flow around the head-dresses and shoulders of the Maries into Veronica's out-thrust veil. The Virgin's dark mantle isolates her as she stands, becalmed in the jostling crowd, wiping the tears from her eyes.However we read the painting, we are inexorably drawn to Christ, crowned with thorns. Although his eyes turn to Veronica, his is the only figure depicted virtually in full face, the Man of Sorrows of devotional imagery

43801-21enseig.jpg	By itself, Watteau's Gilles reveals how far Watteau had cut his style off from the rococo decorators. He continued in pursuit not so much of natural appearances as of human nature. Of course, he understood that the two can go together; and he was to bring them together in one final, supreme, and large-scale treatment, self-commissioned: L'Enseigne de Gersaint.Although nothing so marvellous could have been foreseen, the creation of this picture is logical. It is Watteau's testimony, made solemn by the circumstances, to his passionate attachment to visible things and people. In his own way he had always been a painter of genre. Beneath the airiest of his pictures there lies the scaffolding of his superb drawings, themselves a body of evidence testifying to his vigorous grasp on the hard shell of facts. Ourselves, our place in ordinary life - and in the scheme of things: these were the subjects of interest to the eighteenth century. Watteau, reluctant to make any moral judgment, any metaphysical statement, created instead this view of people in a recognizable environment, in Paris, in the shop of his friend Gersaint. Their aims are still the same as they always were in Watteau's pictures; only this time it is love in a shop instead of a garden, and buying and selling now take the place of music in society.Because quite early (around 1744) it left France for Frederick the Great's collection at Berlin, the picture was not there to help Diderot, for instance, to comprehend Watteau's art. But it may well have influenced the young Chardin, very different though it is from anything he produced. It is a key document, as well as a masterpiece, in which almost every eighteenth-century artistic interest is contained - except the moral one. It is decoration, and trompe-l'oeil decoration, intended for the front of Gersaint's shop - probably for that reason composed, as well as cut, in two halves; not only does it give the illusion of dissolving the shop wall, so that one steps directly in from the street, but the illusion is itself witty: expanding the poky reality of a shop on the Pont Notre-Dame to this grandiose room, with its glimpse of a tall-windowed salon beyond, papered with pictures that Gersaint probably never owned. Thus, though it is genre, it is enchanted genre, animated not only by wit but by a ubiquitous eroticism no longer conveyed through the presence of cupids. It is the paint itself which communicates an almost feverish excitement, a hectic vitality, to the society assembled here in autumn colours, chrysanthemum tones of bronze and yellow and pink, set off by black and silver-grey.These figures are no longer in fancy dress but in fashionable costume, painted with ravishing response not only to lace and silken textures but to plain linen too - like the pierrot-style shirt of the man handling the portrait of Louis XIV. There are no subsidiary groups on a small scale; all the figures have equal importance in the dance-like rhythm which undulates in and out across the composition, with a convenient pause at the centre. The spectator is invited into the picture by the girl who steps from the street into the shops; her ankle breaks the long horizontal where the two meet and her stocking is revealed as a surprising sage green. As she advances, her partner gallantly steps forward as if in a minuet. They are the last of Watteau's couples, brushed by an invisible amorous genius present in Gersaint's shop - more obviously present in some of the pictures on the walls and quite patently in the large Baignade being examined so closely by the kneeling man who has got down to thigh level. In the group who examine a mirror held by the pretty serving-girl there is more ambiguity: the men examine her as well as the mirror, and the mirror reflects back the image of the beautifully-dressed woman customer who gazes somewhat sadly at it. There is nothing so concrete as a story, but all these people seem looking for more than works of art; and the picture becomes concerned with the shop of the human heart.The tantalizing sense of psychological realism, perhaps present from the first in Watteau's work, is seen here on a quite new scale. There could be no advance beyond it, because Watteau was to die the year after it was painted, dying in the arms of Gersaint.The intensity behind the Enseigne de Gersaint  comes from life looked at in a way it can be looked at perhaps only by the artist and the dying; and Watteau was both. The world of Rubens, which had allured him so much, is rivalled here, in scale and handling, and paid to a last homage in the curled-up dog which comes from the Coronation of Marie de M�dicis. This is the real triumph of 'Rub�nisme'; out of homage and emulation has come a quite new art.

05451-3sebasti.jpg	"Botticelli's St Sebastian was put up with great ceremony in 1474 on one of the pillars in Florence's Santa Maria Maggiore church on 20th January, the feast day of the saint. The picture's location explains its unusually long format. It had been common custom since mediaeval times to affix paintings to the pillars of church interiors. In the course of time, however, these pictures were removed from their original locations, so that the interior view of churches as they appear today, with their unadorned pillars, in fact presents an inaccurate picture.The saint is serenely enduring the six arrows that have been shot into him. Clothed only in a loincloth, he is standing on the stumps of a tree that has been cut to the shape of a stake and which rises suddenly in the centre of the picture, in front of the landscape and sky. The torture is past, Sebastian's tormentors have already moved on and are hunting for herons. The scene showing the torturers leaving is a very rare theme for depiction.If we leave the portrayal of the dead Holofernes out of consideration, then St Sebastian may be regarded as Botticelli's first male nude. The artist is following classical ideas in his harmonious proportions and balanced ""contrapposto"".

32779-21graces.jpg	"The figurative powers which Raphael developed in Florence led to a more synthetic conception of form, a refinement of intellectual expression, which are visible in the Knight's Dream in the National Gallery, London, and the Three Graces of Chantilly. Critics believe that the two panels may have formed a single diptych presented to Scipione di Tommaso Borghese at his birth, in 1493. The theme of the paintings may by drawn from the poem, Punica, by Silius Italicus, which was well known in antiquity and which humanistic culture restored to fame. In the first panel, Scipio, the sleeping knight, must choose between Venus (pleasure) and Minerva (virtue); in the second, the Graces reward his choice of virtue with the Golden Apples of the Hesperides. The classical origin of this theme brings us back without doubt to the Florentine environment. The composition, which is dominated by a sense of great harmony, is a figurative consequence of the literary theme.Three Graces are the personification of grace and beauty and the attendants of several goddesses. In art they are often the handmaidens of Venus, sharing several of her attributes such as the rose, myrtle, apple and dice. Their names according to Hesoid (Theogony 905) were Aglaia, Euphrosyne and Thalia. They are typically grouped so that the two outer figures face the spectator, the one in the middle facing away. This was their antique form, known and copied by the Renaissance.The group has been the subject of much allegorising in different ages. Seneca (c. 4 B.C.-A.D. 65) (De Beneficiis l.3:2) described them as smiling maidens, nude or transparently clothed, who stood for the threefold aspect of generosity, the giving, receiving and returning of gifts, or benefits: ""ut una sit quae det beneficium, altera quae accipiat, tertia quae reddat."" The Florentine humanist philosophers of the 15th century saw them as three phases of love: beauty, arousing desire, leading to fulfillment; alternatively as the personification of Chastity, Beauty and Love, perhaps with the inscription ""Castitas, Pulchritudo, Amor.""The Three Graces is Raphael's first study of the female nude in both front and back views. It was probably not based on living models, however, but on the classical sculpture group of the Three Graces in Siena"

37286-10orviet.jpg	"In the case of the Orvieto Polyptych the presence of collaborators is unmistakable. Even though we cannot be entirely certain of the year in which it was painted (despite the suggestion that there is a missing letter in the inscription ""MCCCXX""), the style of the work is very much under the influence of the art of Giotto and the overall mood is one of great solemnity. The frontal composition and the use of certain stylistic elements (such as a fairly rigid volumetric construction) that the Pisa Polyptych appeared to have surpassed, suggest that only the figure of the Madonna is actually by Simone.Originally consisting of seven elements (and while St Peter, Mary Magdalene and St Dominic are all shown in exactly the same pose, St Paul is facing towards the right), this polyptych is now in the Cathedral Museum, although it was painted originally for the church of San Domenico. The painting was commissioned by the Bishop of Sovana, Trasmundo Monaldeschi, the former prior of the Dominican monastery, who paid a hundred gold florins for this altarpiece; he is portrayed in the panel together with Mary Magdalene"

Mary, wearing a red dress and with her hair falling loosely across her shoulders, is bent over her sewing. She is framed by two adult angels while above her hover two putti with inscription ribbons alluding to her predestined role as mother of God (VOCAVIT IS QUI VOCAT EAM A PRINCIPIO). The scene is read as Mary's service in the temple, preceding the Annunciation. According to the Golden legend, this phase in Mary's life was characterized by daily prayer and needlework that caused her to become more holy while experiencing the constant company of angels.The seven putti above were painted by Francesco Albani

08951-breakfas.jpg	The work of the Dutch still-life painters who appear around 1620 corresponds to the tonal trend of the landscapists of van Goyen's generation. Pieter Claesz and Willem Claesz. Heda, popularizers of the breakfast piece, are the principal representatives of this phase. Claesz, the father of the landscapist Nicolaes Berchem, was born at Berchem (probably the village near Antwerp). Heda's origins are obscure. Both were primarily active at Haarlem and underwent similar stylistic developments.Their early works show the influence of the older still-life painters, but they soon limited themselves to the description of a simple meal set near the corner of a table - some bread and cheese, a herring on a pewter dish, a glass of beer or wine, perhaps a silvery pewter vessel, and a white crumpled tablecloth - just enough to suggest a light breakfast or snack. These objects, which always look as if they had been touched by someone who is still close by, are no longer treated as isolated entities: they are grouped together, forming masses along a single diagonal axis. But more important, Pieter Claesz and Heda reacted to the comprehensive forces of light and atmosphere which envelop us and the things with which we live, and they found means to express their reactions to these forces as accurately, immediately, and intensely as possible. As a result, they seem to animate their simple subjects. With a new pictorial mode, they achieve a more dynamic spatial and compositional treatment.The foreground of their unpretentious arrangements becomes spacious, and there is clear recession. Instead of vivid local colours, monochromatic harmonies with sensitive contrasts of valeurs of low intensity are favoured, without, however, a loss of the earlier regard for textural differentiation. From the point of view of composition and of colouristic, tonal, and spatial treatment the perfectly balanced still-lifes by Claesz and Heda are among the most satisfying Dutch paintings made during the century.Claesz has a more vigorous touch than Heda. He was also a man of simpler tastes. Heda depicts oysters more frequently than herrings, and after 1640 his compositions became larger, richer, and more decorative. To obtain a more monumental effect, during his maturity Heda often abandons the traditional horizontal format for a vertical one. Ornate silver vessels and costly 'fa�on de Venise' glasses, at the time blown in the Netherlands as well as Venice, intensify the contrasts of valeurs, and touches of colour provided by the pink of sliced hams and ripe fruit are combined with an increased chiaroscuro

23853-3manet12.jpg	This picture was painted during the summer of 1874, when Manet was working with Monet and Renoir at Argenteuil, a village on the Seine northwest of Paris. The influence of the two young Impressionist painters on Manet is evident in the subject matter - a celebration of the everyday pleasures of the middle class - and in the fact that Manet's dark, Spanish palette has given way here to high-keyed hues. The flattened composition, in which the high viewpoint causes the water's surface to rise up as a backdrop, is cut off at the edges of the canvas, reflecting Manet's interest, shared with the Impressionists, in Japanese prints.The Argenteuil (of vertical format) and the Boating (of horizontal format) are two open air genre portraits - rather than landscapes - which Manet painted in August 1874 at Argenteuil. The vertical-format painting is structurally the tighter thanks to its linear components, and is also the richest in motifs and forms. The sketchy horizontal-format picture uses large spaces of glowing colour.  We do not know who the women in these paintings are; the man was either Manet's brother-in-law, the Dutch painter Rodolphe Leenhoff, or Baron Barbier

26081-25nobath.jpg	"The influence of Van der Weyden's Virgins is evident in the figure of the maid helping her mistress Bathsheba from the bath and wrapping a robe around her naked body. The similarity to van der Weyden's type of Madonna is so striking that scholars were previously inclined to attribute this large painting to him. Not only is this picture unusual for featuring a nude outside a religious context (they usually appeared only in depictions of the Fall or the Last Judgment), but it is significant for revealing a number of features which have helped to define Memling's significance for 15th-century painting.Memling constructed a narrative space in this work which is exemplary for northern European painting. On the back wall of the bathroom a window is open, revealing a roof terrace: ""And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon."" This is the description of events in the Second Book of Samuel (chapter 11), prior to the king committing adultery and murder. Below the palace is a portal leading into a church on which a wall relief can be seen depicting the death of Bathsheba's husband, the Hittite Uriah, whom David sent to certain death in battle. Beside the portal projects an apse on whose wall can be seen painted sculptures of Moses and Abraham as representatives of law.The painting is divided into a dominant scene in the foreground and a secondary scene, subordinate to this, in the background. This background narrative is of the traditional pattern, that of painted church sculpture. Memling was not so much concerned with the biblical story - which may have served as justification of a nude figure - as with the translation of a biblical motif into a domestic setting in 15yh-century Flanders. Moreover, the upper left-hand corner has been added at a later date, probably in the 17th century. The original corner piece, now in the Chicago Art Institute, shows David giving a messenger a ring for Bathsheba"

15474-1passign.jpg	Ghirlandaio painted the scene of the Last Supper on several occasions within the space of a few years. In all three works of his that still remain, the basic arrangement is the same as that in the fresco by Andrea del Castagno in the Florentine Cenacolo di Sant'Apollonia dating from about 1450. The disciples are sitting at a long table in front of a rear wall that runs parallel to the picture plan. Christ is sitting in the centre, and His favourite disciple John is leaning sadly against Him. To the right of Christ, in the place of honour, is the chief Apostle, Peter. Judas the traitor is the only one to be separated from the others: he is seated in front of the table.The earliest example of the Last Supper was painted in 1476 by Ghirlandaio in the abbey of San Michele Arcangelo a Passignano (in Tavernelle Val di Pesa, near Florence). This is strongly influenced by Andrea del Castagno. The Apostles and Christ are sitting together in a room with a flat ceiling that appears to be too low. Judas is sitting opposite Christ on a three-legged stool in front of the laid table. The figures are set back some distance from us, to a depth of three large floor tiles. The various emotions of the Apostles are indicated by stiff hand movements that scarcely seem alive and express little of the character of the individuals

25149-virgin_c.jpg	This scene depicting the Virgin Mary venerated by a donor and St Jerome, takes place in a grassy garden bounded by a low stone wall, which evokes the 'hortus conclusus' (enclosed garden) of the Song of Songs, a Mariological symbol of virginity popular in sacred literature and art of the fifteenth century. Formerly the panel was attributed to an anonymous Florentine painter of the second half of the fifteenth century under the influence of contemporary German art. However, now the panel is recognized  as Bavarian and is assigned to the Master of the Munich Marian panels, a master probably active in Munich in the mid-fifteenth century, named after an Annunciation and a Nativity in the Kunsthaus, Zurich.

39426-1antico1.jpg	Four almost square paintings by Tintoretto, Bacchus, Venus and Ariadne; Minerva Sending Away Mars from Peace and Prosperity; Vulcan's Forge; Mercury and the Graces) are set in stucco frames and arranged symmetrically on the walls of the Sala dell'Anticollegio in the Palazzo Ducale. Originally they were on the walls of the Atrio Quadrato (Square Anteroom) in the same palace. The four works have mythological or allegorical subjects and were originally part of a compact program to celebrate the good government of Doge Gerolamo Priuli. The figures and landscapes enshrine images of concord and prosperity and are classical in inspiration. The paintings were meant by the author to extol the unity and glory of the Venetian Republic.In Bacchus, Venus and Ariadne, Bacchus arrives from the sea with his wreath and skirt of vine leaves, bearing a bunch of grapes and a ring. Among her rocks and drapes, Ariadne feebly extends her ring finger as an airborne Venus crowns her with stars. Ariadne - discovered by Bacchus on the island of Naxos and crowned by Venus to be received amongst the gods - stands for Venice, born on the sea, graced by divine favour and crowned by freedom.

30636-holifami.jpg	This painting was traditionally attributed to Raphael or his workshop. This was substituted at  the turn of the nineteenth century by an attribution to Giulio Romano. Recently the attribution went to Giovan Francesco Penni working from a drawing by Raphael.The balance and elegance permit the recognition of Raphael's hand in the invention of the work. At the same time, the pictorial solution - of very high quality, yet not enough to allow for full attribution to Raphael himself - shows that the composition sketched by the master during his Florentine phase must have been executed several years later in his workshop in Rome. Penni, who entered Raphael's workshop in Florence and followed him to Rome, assisting in the master's projects with a smooth and elegant hand, can be nominated as the most convincing candidate for the execution of this exceptional work, which inspired numerous copies in central Italy

21556-tutor.jpg	Largilli�re started his career in France with the particular variation of the idiom of the Netherlands which was current in England about 1680, and during the first twenty years after his transfer to Paris we find him adapting it to suit the taste of his country. In some portraits he applies the English convention directly, but in most cases he combines elements from it with other devices. For instance, in the portrait of a tutor and his pupil, the angular draperies of the pupil and the schematic drawing of his face belong to the English convention, whereas the head of the tutor is in a quite different vein of naturalism, suggesting rather a knowledge of Dutch painting. The pattern itself, with the two figures cut off at three-quarter-length, is a formula derived from Van Dyck and much favoured by his English followers. But the affectation of the boy's pose and the unexpected placing of the dog in the foreground, facing into the composition, distinguish the painting from English models.This painting is an outstanding example of French portraiture from the last quarter of the seventeenth century. The artist signed and dated it very clearly to 1685 on the stone pedestal in the lower right section of the composition.The theme of a tutor and his ward was employed by another, somewhat earlier painter. Largilli�re's composition has precedents, albeit generic ones, in double portraits by Anthony van Dyck, William Dobson, and Peter Lely, all of whom had significant portrait practices in England, where Largilli�re trained in his youth

16805-1cavall1.jpg	The Salone dei Cavalli (Room of the Horses) was one of the first rooms to be completed, in 1526. It was used for banquets or dances. Originally, the lower parts of the walls were decorated with worked leather hangings. The upper parts display a fully articulated architectural system - Corinthian pilasters that support a trabeation (an architectural beem), above which runs a continuous frieze of putti and racemes. Illusionistic niches and panels are opened into the walls, and full-sized statues, marble busts of ancient gods, and fictive bronze reliefs of the Labours of Hercules are represented in them. Six fictive windows penetrate the illusionistic architecture, and they look out over panoramic landscapes with life-sized portraits of Federico Gonzaga's most valuable thoroughbreds.The execution of the architectural and antiquarian decoration in this room was wholly entrusted to the shop, but the horses, most of which are identified by name, are of exceptional quality, they were likely painted by Giulio himself

16464-1crucif.jpg	In contrast to earlier representations of Christ on the Cross, such as those by his teacher Cimabue, Giotto emphasizes the earthly heaviness of the body: the head sinks deeply forward and the almost plump body sags. The human side of the Son of God is made clear. Mary and John look down sorrowfully from the horizontal ends of the cross at the dead Lord.This, probably Giotto's earliest surviving work, is the largest and most ambitious of the shaped panels of Christ on the cross painted by Giotto. Although his limited anatomical knowledge prevented him attaining the realism of his later crucifixes (in Padua and Rimini), Giotto's break with Byzantine tradition is clear. This can be seen from the natural pose, the sense of real weight in the way Christ's body so painfully hangs, the basic simplicity of the loin-cloth, and the realism of the two feet fixed with a single nail.Stylistic parallels with the so-called Isaac frescoes in the Upper Church, San Francesco, Assisi, lead some scholars to identify the Master of the Isaac Stories as Giotto

42099-18thomas.jpg	In 1565 Cosimo I de' Medici initiated the redecoration of the Florentine church of Santa Croce and chose Giorgio Vasari as his architect. Owners of the private chapels were not allowed to determine the architectural forms of their chapel or to select the subject of the altarpieces that adorned them, the altarpieces were prescribed in Vasari's program. All are of narrative events, conventional Madonna and Child representations are completely absent. Vasari devised a program of Christ's Passion and post-Passion histories which provided a continuous narrative from one altar to the next.The Incredulity of St Thomas was commissioned from Vasari by Tommaso and Francesco Guidacci for their chapel in the church. The painting shows Christ and St Thomas in the centre, framed by arches, with the subordinated figures focusing attention toward the narrative centre of the painting.

The basic approach of the two paintings is of evident Byzantine tradition: the elegant stylization of the hands, the typical downward curving nose, the red maph�rion under Mary's veil, the dark drapery animated by shining gilded lines. New details appear, to a lesser extent in the Buonconvento Madonna and repeated with greater confidence in the Crevole painting, such as the subtle play of light on the Virgin's face, over her chin and cheeks, and a clear attempt at plasticism in the folds of the garment around the face

31807-1explosi.jpg	"On Monday, October 12, 1654, shortly after half past eleven in the morning, one of Delft's powder magazines exploded and devastated a large part of the city. The ""Delfische Donderslag"" (Delft Thunderclap) was said to have been heard as far away as the island of Texel, seventy miles north of Delft. The magazine, known as the Secreet van Hollandt, had been established in the former Clarissenklooster (Convent of Saint Clare) in the northeastern corner of Delft in 1572. When the magazine, large parts of which were underground, exploded, it contained about ninety thousand pounds of gunpowder. The force of the blast was so great that most houses in the immediate vicinity were destroyed and buildings throughout the city were damaged. The two major churches, the Oude and the Nieuwe Kerk, were also damaged. Although the number of people killed is not known, it has been estimated that deaths were in the hundreds. Among the casualties was one of Delft's most famous painters, Carel Fabritius. News of the event spread rapidly throughout the country. The States General sent a note of condolence; Elizabeth, queen of Bohemia, paid a visit; and many other people came to survey the devastation.While we do not know whether Van der Poel witnessed the explosion, it is possible that he was personally touched by it: one of his children may have died in the catastrophe. Certainly, the event had a great effect on his work. About twenty versions of the present composition survive, showing either the explosion itself or the devastated townscape that was left in its wake. Toward the right of the picture is the area of the former magazine. All that is left are a crater filled with water, some charred trees, remnants of houses, and piles of rubble. In the foreground people are busy helping the wounded, consoling one another, and trying to salvage whatever belongings may have survived. The low vantage point accentuates the depth of the space and the extent of the devastated area. Van der Poel unifies the space with a diagonal line that starts at the bridge on the left and reaches into the far background.Although the depiction is devoid of much of the atmospheric quality for which Delft painting has been known since the late 1640s - a quality present in the works of Fabritius, Paulus Potter, Adam Pynacker and Daniel Vosmaer - Van der Poel employs pronounced light effects to counteract the plunging perspective. The receding space is carefully structured as alternating areas of light and shade, with some of the most brightly illuminated walls placed immediately behind the looming remnants of former houses in the left foreground. The rather dense mass of buildings on the left, accentuated by the two churches rising at the horizon, is balanced by the wide-open area on the right, to which the eye is automatically drawn. The canal running parallel to the picture plane creates a stage-like area in the foreground upon which the figures display the human dimension of the tragedy.Most of Van der Poel's paintings of the event bear the precise date of the explosion. It may be assumed, however, that this date is a record of the momentous occasion rather than of the execution of the painting. Having discovered a market for these pictures, Van der Poel seems to have continued painting them for several years, despite his departure for Rotterdam in 1654 or early 1655. The notion that the artist concentrated on this subject in order to overcome the trauma of the tragic event is one more at home in the twentieth century than in Van der Poel's day - yet the experience may have inspired his choice of ""brandjes"", paintings of blazing fires dramatically set against a nocturnal sky, as the principal undertaking of his Rotterdam period"

24051-2sposi03.jpg	The narrative content of the Meeting anticipates the event depicted on the north wall, for here the letter that Ludovico will later open is being delivered. In this scene Mantegna combines portraiture, the almost archaeological reconstruction of an ancient city, and a highly-specified, convincing landscape.The scene is interpreted as the chance encounter between Ludovico Gonzaga and his son, Cardinal Francesco. The painting also can be seen as a presentation of three generations in the male line of the Gonzaga. The cluster of sons and grandsons around the marchese, who is here portrayed a second time, illustrates an aspect of the dynasty of fundamental importance for its continued health. The line of succession is assured, with a division of power in each generation between those selected for secular career and those called to a life in the Church. The depiction of the marchese with his oldest son, Federico (his mirror image at the left side of the picture), as well as Federico's son Francesco (the boy to the left) clearly suggests the continuity of the dynastic line. By contrast, the powerful central figure of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga and the two boys he holds by the hand - Sigismondo and Ludovico Gonzaga, who would also later enter the Church - assure us that with the succession of clerical dignitaries it produces the family has an ongoing tie to the Curia and to the pope

35634-03sketch.jpg	By the early 1620s Rubens had perfected the art of giving an evocative depiction of the most static as well as the most complicated and dramatically charged subjects from religious and secular literature. It is therefore no coincidence that around this time and in the years following he designed the cycles, that form perhaps the creative culmination of his whole career. In these new tasks - and partly because of their unprecedented scale - his style showed innovations  first evident in the great series he was commissioned to product in 1620 for the ceiling of the Jesuit church in Antwerp. This building was decorated from Rubens's designs with some forty large ceiling paintings with scenes from the Old and New Testaments, as well as some representing scenes from the lives of saints. The paintings, largely executed by Van Dyck after Rubens's design, were in 1718 destroyed in a fire. The quality of the painting can be judged  from several drawn and engraved copies, and especially from the survival of numerous oil sketches, such as King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.This typical sketch shows that in every respect his style is dependent on that of the famous Venetian 'soffitti', the painted ceilings by Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese, which express the same liveliness and sense of illusion.Rubens's modelli for the lost ceiling paintings show clearly how much the dazzling, nervous style of his work varies from the more controlled classicism of his earlier years.

15118-esther.jpg	Aert de Gelder was one of Rembrandt's last pupils and continued to work in the spirit and style of his master long after other pupils, for instance, Maes, Gerbrand van den Eeckhout and Jan Lievens, had succumbed to the fashionable trend towards smooth and perfunctory painting. He painted large compositions with two or three figures, mostly based on the Old Testament subjects so favoured by Rembrandt. Like his master, he loved rich properties and colourful draperies - the eighteenth-century historiographer Van Houbraken records that his studio was a veritable gallery of antiques, full of ancient weapons, silks and all kinds of utensils - and he used manikins for the sake of greater authenticity, carefully dressing them to suit the requirements of his theme. He painted with broad strokes of the brush, as Rembrandt had, and created warm tonalities and colour harmonies.Esther and Mordecai, dating from 1685, is one of de Gelder's most valuable and characteristic works. The Old Testament book of Esther is summarized here into a single dramatic moment, the internal tension being conveyed through the structure of the composition and through the gestures. The painting depicts the scene of the Biblical story when Mordecai, foster-father of Esther persuades the Queen to induce her husband to save the Jewish people. De Gelder painted several versions of this subject differing in various degrees; the version now in the Providence Museum of Art, Rhode Island, also depicting half-length figures, is particularly close to the painting in Budapest

00121-marketsc.jpg	"This Market Scene - a painting in vertical format - shows a column of sea food on the left, building up and culminating in a ray and - directly opposite, on the right - a large number of fruits of the field and the garden. Wedged between this enormous abundance of produce, the farmer and his wife appear to be mere appendages whose job is only that  of proudly pointing with silent gestures to the victuals that are on offer.The ostentatious wealth of fruit and vegetables in the market scenes of Aertsen and Beuckelaer may lead to the false conclusion that the population had plenty to eat. But although more was being offered on the markets, this did not meet the demands of the urban population, who had to pay exorbitant prices for agricultural produce in comparison to what they actually earned. And so, the horn-of-plenty motif of these market pictures reflects far more the perception of those who benefited, that is, the newly-rich farmers. In this way the artist emphasized the commercial aesthetics of agricultural products from the farmers' fields and gardens, products that were meant to arouse in the viewer the desire to buy, though not in the sense of present-day advertising.However, this does not exclude the possibility of ambivalent reasoning behind such paintings. While stimulating people's cravings and appealing to their needs, they often contained a subtle element of criticism, particularly in Aertsen's biblically motivated pictures. This criticism concerned the contradiction between people's consumer habits and the demand of temperance (""fasting""). While this critical element was still obvious in Aertsen's paintings, it seems to have disappeared almost completely in Beuckelaer's.This painting has a multiple theme. The abundance of the market could be at the same time a representation of the Four Elements and an allegory of the Five Senses. Also the market woman is being pestered by a bird-catcher, who is gripping a duck round the neck with obvious erotic overtones - as well as a realistic representation. The painting is also a moral lesson, extolling moderation and restraint in contrast to the physical and sensual pleasured offered, for instance, in the plumpness of the fruit. In other paintings Aertsen introduced a religious scene in the background by way of admonition"

19844-10lastsu.jpg	"As was recognized very early by art historians, the composition of Holbein's Last Supper was based on Leonardo da Vinci's famous mural in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. As in Leonardo's picture, in Holbein's version the back wall is pierced by three windows, with the central window being reserved for the figure of Christ; the position of heads and arms also corresponds to Leonardo's composition. The dramatic interpretation likewise follows Leonardo's, the subject of the picture being the moment following Christ's announcement that He will soon be betrayed by one of them: as in the Leonardo, the apostles are animatedly discussing the shocking words Christ has just spoken. But, typically for Holbein, he does not adhere slavishly to the original; he alters the gestures and postures of the disciples, and also their faces. In addition, the eye is not led through the window openings to a distant landscape; Holbein encloses the shallow pictorial space by an intense blue sky that looks completely ethereal. The picture format is also more compact than Leonardo's, requiring a much more compressed arrangement of the figures.Jesus and his disciples sit at a narrow, covered table celebrating the Last Supper, but only nine of the twelve apostles are present. The three missing figures were possibly shown on the edges of the picture, which were lost when the panels were attacked in the iconoclastic riots of Reformation Basel, when the head of Christ was sawn out of the picture. The inventory of the Amerbach collection notes critically that the ""supper on wood"" was ""coarsely"" glued together"

30269-y_woman.jpg	Jacopo d'Antonio Negreti, known to art history as Palma Vecchio (Palma the Elder), left Serinalta, near Bergamo, while still a youth and went to Venice. Although a pupil of Giovanni Bellini, his early work reveals the powerful influence of Giorgione. In spite of research, little is known about the early years of his career, but this small bust and its companion-piece which are jointly known as Portraits of a Betrothed Couple are considered to be early works.In the early seventeenth century this portrait of a young girl with flowing silky hair, and its counterpart, depicting a smooth-faced youth crowned with a garland, were considered to be the work of Giorgione. Indeed this attribution is most understandable, for the paintings have something of the intimate and lyrical atmosphere associated with Giorgione; on the other hand the placing of the figures in a landscape setting, the blue sky and the generally light colouring, are all reminiscent of Giovanni Bellini. Recent research, therefore, suggests that the pictures were painted by Palma Vecchio, an artist who was close to both these painters, and they are now assumed to date from the beginning of the sixteenth century. It may well be that the two likenesses had a symbolic meaning, for in seventeenth-century Venetian records they are listed as Portraits of a Roman Consul and His Wife

07605-62behead.jpg	"This is the most important painting that Caravaggio made in Malta. It is still in the Oratorio di San Giovanni (now St John Museum) in La Valletta. This is one of Caravaggio's most extraordinary creations, for many it is his greatest masterpiece. It is characterized by a magical balance of all the parts. It is no accident that the artist brings back into the painting a precise reference to the setting, placing behind the figures, as a backdrop, the severe, sixteenth century architecture of the prison building, at the window of which, in a stroke of genius, two figures silently witness the scene (the commentators are thus drawn into the painting, and no longer projected, as in the Martyrdom of St Matthew, toward the outside).This is a final compendium of Caravaggio's art. Well-known figures return (the old woman, the youth, the nude ruffian, the bearded nobleman), as do Lombard elements. The technical means adhere to the deliberate, programmatic limitation to which Caravaggio adapts them; but amid these soft tones, these dark colours, is an impressive sense of drawing that the artist does not give up, and that is visible even through the synoptic glints of light of his late works. This eminently classical balance, which projects the event beyond contingency, unleashes a harsh drama that is even more effective to the extent that, having given up the ""aesthetic of exclamation"" forever, Caravaggio limits every external, excessive sign of emotional emphasis. The painter signed in the Baptist's blood: ""f (perhaps to understood as fecit rather than frater) michela..."". This is the seal he placed on what may well be his greatest masterpiece.The painting, restored in Florence in the 1990s, is displayed in the in the Oratorio di San Giovanni Battista dei Cavalieri for which it was painted"

40896-07diptyc.jpg	Both figures are seen in an open gallery continuing over the two panels, which is supported at the back by red marble columns and in the front is contained by a parapet. The Virgin has placed the Child on the parapet, where he turns on his knees towards the donor. Jesus blesses him with his right hand and holds red cherries, the fruits of Paradise, in his left. The background consists of a winding river running through a hilly landscape which is bordered on both sides by a piece of architecture. This vista is definitely inspired by Rogier van der Weyden's Virgin of St Luke (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), whereas the type of this devotional diptych is clearly borrowed from Memling. The costume with the broad fur collar suggests a rather late date, i.e. after 1490.The painting certainly shows fine detail but on closer inspection the modelling is rather stereotyped and simplified; notably the slightly blurred shapes of landscape elements poorly reflect Memlingian examples

43971-0miraflo.jpg	The work consists of three separate panels of the same size arranged side by side, rigid and not in folding form. The original frame must have been constructed in a similar way to the present one, although probably not gold but the colour of the painted architectural arches, so that the real frame seemed like a continuation of the painted architectural framework, thus heightening the illusion, and creating (especially in the upper sections of the altarpiece) a perfect link between the painted archivolts and tracery spandrels and the real frame between them. Such combinations of real and painted framework structures, designed to increase the illusion, had already occurred in several works by Jan van Eyck.In the Miraflores Altarpiece the painted architectural frames represent portals, and with their sculptural construction and tripartite form they are reminiscent of the portals of Gothic church architecture. Convincingly designed as they are in detail, they are not a realistic reproduction of any actual place, but are settings for scenes representing important elements in the relationship between the Virgin Mary and Christ rather than historical events.On the left, the Virgin Mary is praying to the son on her lap; the central panel is a Piet&#224; in which, Christ's body on her lap, she mourns His death and suffering; to the right, the risen Christ appears to her in order to end her grief. The reliefs in the archivolts, showing other events from the lives of the Virgin Mary and Christ, accompany and comment on these scenes. They provide much more extensive narrative than the main scenes, showing their context in chronological order, running counter-clockwise and beginning at the apex of each archivolt.Colour contributes a great deal to the complex programmatic content of the altarpiece. In contemporary painting of the time, and therefore in the work of Rogier, the colours of garments often convey meaning, but seldom so cogently as in the Miraflores Altarpiece. The colour of Mary's clothing, which differs from one panel to the next, is not only aesthetically effective and diversified, but also makes a fundamental symbolic statement: white is for the purity of the Virgin, red for her pain, blue for her faith - virtues for which the angels hovering above, as the text on their scrolls indicate, are bringing her crowns.The figures in the Miraflores Altarpiece are slightly more delicate and less powerful than those of the Deposition (Prado, Madrid), an impression reinforced even by comparison of the spandrels in the tracery. This difference may be to do with the much smaller size of the Mary altarpiece, but it corresponds to a general tendency in Rogier's development. Its change in figure style is accompanied by a change in the depiction of faces, which have become slightly more abstract and less lifelike. It seems probable, then, that the Miraflores Altarpiece was painted later than the Deposition. Art historians long assumed that it had been painted before the Werl Altarpiece by the Master of Fl�malle, dated 1438, because the gesture of the right hand of John the Baptist in the left-hand wing of that work (Prado, Madrid) was assumed to derive from the depiction of the risen Christ in the Miraflores altarpiece. However, the underdrawing clearly shows that the position of the hands was much altered in both figures during work on the paintings. Consequently, the artists must have been drawing on a common stock of workshop models to come up with their eventual solutions, and no chronological conclusions can be drawn. It seems most probable that King Juan commissioned the Mary altarpiece especially for his foundation of Miraflores, which would suggest that it was painted in the early 1440s

32299-2sacram2.jpg	For Paris intellectuals Poussin produced during the ten years after his return to Rome the paintings which were regarded in his own time as his most perfect, and which are now considered to be among the purest embodiments of French classicism. To this group belong the second series of Sacraments, executed for Paul Fr�art de Chantelou, a civil servant, between 1644 and 1648.The second series of Sacraments have a solemnity wholly lacking in the more picturesque first series. This is perhaps most apparent in the Eucharist, one of Poussin's most severe compositions. The scene is set in a room of the utmost simplicity, without ornament, and articulated only with plain Doric pilasters. The apostles are shown lying on couches round the table and are dressed in Roman togas. The artist has chosen a moment which enables him to combine the two main themes which the subject involves: the dramatic and the sacramental. Christ has given the bread to the apostles and is about to bless the cup, but on the left of the composition we see the figure of Judas leaving the room. That is to say, Poussin represents primarily the institution of the Eucharist, but at the same time reminds the spectator of Christ's words: 'One of you shall betray me'. The double theme is made even clearer in the actions of the apostles, which are defined with great precision. Some are engaged in eating the bread, others show their realization of the significance of what is taking place by gestures of astonishment, while St John's expression of sorrow shows that he is thinking of Christ's words about Judas.Formally Poussin has concentrated his group into a symmetrical relief pattern. His choice of a low view-point has enabled him to foreshorten the front apostles, so that they form a compact group with those on the other side of the table

17148-arles70.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 516, JH 1685.Shortly before van Gogh left Arles he painted this view of the town, seen over the blossoming orchards and gardens and through a screen of tall trees. This image of the town differs from those he produced in the early months of his stay. Neither the agricultural environs of wheatfields nor the industrial landmarks of gas-tanks and railway lines are depicted. Instead we see an old, medieval Arles, surrounded by its cultivated and fertile gardens. The sense of enclosure and fruitfulness, dreaminess even, has parallels in the illustrations of the medieval devotional books of hours, such as the Tr�s Riches Heures of the Duc de Berry.

07168-canal209.jpg	The colourful and picturesque San Giacomo di Rialto, also called San Giacometto, is considered by Venetians to be the city's oldest church. Though its present appearance dates from 1601, the original, small church was erected in the eleventh or twelfth century for the merchants trading on the market square near Rialto. The famous clock dates from 1401. The stucco and the medieval portico extend into the adjacent house, giving the church an unusually asymmetrical appearance.To judge from the commercial success of Carlevaris's print series Le Fabriche, e vedute di Venetia of 1703, a lively interest existed in what might be described as portraits of actual buildings and in the more broadly conceived townscapes. However, Canaletto only began producing work in this genre in the 1730s, at the instigation of English patrons. Of his early work this painting comes closest to being an actual portrait of a building, although the church is set in a somewhat more spacious architectural scene. In this and other respects as well the painting is very reminiscent of the Santi Giovanni e Paolo and the Scuola di San Marco and the Grand Canal near Santa Maria delta Carit&#224;, made for Stefano Conti. For instance, the most important building is not centred. There is a strong contrast between the heavily shaded area on the right and the brightly lit fa�ade of the small church, which is emphasized as a result.Canaletto made a precise graphite or chalk drawing of the church using a ruler and compass in order to achieve as accurate a likeness as possible. The brushwork is loose but careful, with particular attention given to subtle nuances in the coloured surfaces, such as the reddish-ochre stucco on the church fa�ade.It is remarkable that Canaletto devoted so much attention in his early work to Venetian ecclesiastical architecture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in particular, and so little to the more modern architecture of his own day. It was only in the 1730s that he turned to contemporary architecture, and this thematic shift runs parallel to and may also be connected with a fundamental change of style

03982-bello210.jpg	After the large vedute of Dresden, the royal capital, Bellotto turned his attention to the smaller town of Pirna, further up the Elbe, with the royal castle of Sonnenstein rising magnificently above it. The artist's eleven views of Pirna, taken from greatly differing angles (but always showing Sonnenstein Castle), number among his most beautiful works.The foreground of this veduta shows the small harbour at Pirna, which opens onto the Elbe. The pool was only used to store river-barges in winter; ships loaded with goods would moor downriver, beyond the customs house, on the corner to the far right, which stands to this day. The veduta shows few of the town's better-known buildings: the castle rises sublimely above it, and the small guardhouses can clearly be seen on the tips of the bastions.The main fascination of this view, however, lies in the row of small, simple buildings set parallel to the picture plane, some half-timbered, some in plain masonry, but all shown fairly close up with their sheds and outhouses, washing and stacked wood. Bellotto performs a daring artistic feat by casting these shabby buildings, so central to the composition, totally in shadow. Dutch painting of the seventeenth century frequently used such effects.Indeed, Bellotto underlines here the 'Dutch' character of his Pirna vedute by adding elements typical of genre painting: laundry is being hung out to dry in the foreground, using a gnarled willow behind a hut as a clothes-pole. Further to the right, a boat is landing, and the boatman is in the process of casting a rope to some men ashore. To the far left, however, where the veduta brings the castle, church and wooden shacks tightly together, a herdsman has driven his cattle to drink in the shallow waters

19770-woodland.jpg	Hobbema was Jacob van Ruisdael's most important follower and his only documented pupil. In the beginning the influence of the older master is unmistakable. In 1663 Hobbema's style gained more independence and, during this and the following years up to 1668, he created a series of masterpieces which gave him an outstanding position side by side with Ruisdael among the great landscapists of Holland.Hobbema's outlook on nature is less brooding, more sunny, and vivacious than Ruisdael's. While the latter favoured compactness of form and composition, Hobbema's tree groups are less tightly built, and their silhouettes are rather feathery. He likes to open up his compositions with various outlooks into a shiny distance, and his luminous skies of an intense white and blue permeate the whole with sparkling daylight. Hobbema's painterly touch is more fluid, and the colours are richly varied in an interplay of bright green and light brown, fine greys, and reds. Often an appealing blond tonality prevails

The expedition was at first prevented from sailing by unfavourable winds, so Agamemnon consulted a seer, Calchas.

The identity of the person portrayed is beyond any doubt since there exists a copy of the work bearing Sforza's name.Even the earliest documents attribute this portrait to Piero del Pollaiuolo.

24862-madonna.jpg	Clothed in a blue robe edged with gold and lined with ermine, from which a delicate chemisette appears, and wearing a red veil, the Virgin is contemplating the infant Jesus resting on a cushion covered with an immaculately white cloth. A sense of great gentleness emanates from her person, from her face which is at once serene and serious, and from her hands which appear hardly to touch each other. She is surrounded by four angels, one of which is holding the cushion upright. The delicate play of light underlines the charm of the faces and the expressive hands, either joined in prayer or separated in delight. The Child himself presents certain features that confer on him a special physical presence: a small, bulbous stomach, chubby thighs and, in particular, the tuned-in toes so typical of all babies, show the artist's interest in the particular features of babies' bodies. A certain contrast exists between the solid volumes of the figures and the abstract, shallow space evoked by the gilded background.Stylistic affinities with certain works from the artist's early career enable us to date the painting at around 1490. The iconography of the Virgin surrounded by angels is fairly rare in northern countries, but appears more frequently in Italy. The Master of Moulins treated this theme at least three times. Apart from the present painting, we find it again in the central panel of the great Moulins triptych, also in a small painting in the Bacri collection.The Master of Moulins owes his name to the small town of Moulins, the old capital of the Bourbonnais region, the cathedral of which conserves the Triptych of the Virgin in Glory Surrounded by Angels, around which are grouped works attributed to him: fourteen paintings, one miniature, one sketch and a stained glass window. From his style, it is thought that he might have been a pupil of Hugo van der Goes before developing an elegant and refined style, which proved popular at the Bourbon court where he appears to have been the painter in residence. Certain authors suggest that the artist can be identified with Jean Hey, a painter originally from the Netherlands, whose name is known to us from an inscription on the back of an Ecce Homo. This painting, also preserved at the Brussels museum, was painted at Moulins in 1494 for Jean Cueillette, the notary and secretary of Pierre II of Bourbon

13616-2fenyes.jpg	"""Shelling Beans"" is one of the most beautiful of F�nyes's sunny  pictures. It is a good example of the painter's Impressionism. He enhanced the subject matter, an everyday one of three figures husking beans in a village yard, to an ecstatic spectacle. In the delicately tinted picture, reflexes of colours, greyish, bluish and pinky shades are clearly visible which divide the canvass into patches of colours. Due to the sunshine which can substract colours and make even shadows colourful, the picture is rich in colours: shades of red, ultramarine and blues are mixed with grey. His composition is not based only on forms arranged in space, but on the ability of the sun to change colours. Independently of painters of the Nagyb�nya school, F�nyes was engaged in similar problems as e.g. Ferenczy in the colours of ""October"" or ""Sunny Morning""."

17958-01marco3.jpg	Benozzo Gozzoli was a student of Fra Angelico who had a formative influence on him. He collaborated in the pictorial decoration of the dormitory cells in the Florentine Dominican monastery of San Marco, which took place from 1438 to 1444/45. There Fra Angelico and his assistants were painting a small devotional fresco in each cell, while Cosimo de' Medici's double cell (cell 38/39) was furnished with a larger wall painting, the Adoration of the Magi (cell 39) and a Crucifixion with Saints Cosmas, Damian, John and Peter (cell 38, the vestibule). The complete integration of the youthful Benozzo's artistic style with that of Fra Angelico has meant that it is only in recent times that it has been possible to identify with a fair degree of accuracy a variety of interventions by his hand, which were first limited to isolated figures or group of figures. Later he had more responsibility and scholars now agree that he was almost exclusively responsible for the decoration of Cosimo de' Medici's cells.Gozzoli's decisive part in the production of the Adoration of the Magi can be recognised stylistically by the fact that, compared t the works of his teacher, the colours are softer, the plasticity of forms is reduced in favour of sharper contours, and the landscape in the background acts as a backdrop. Here the religious theme of the Epiphany is set in a bleak rocky landscape which rises up behind the Three Kings' retinue. This corresponds to the religious mood of Fra Angelico's pictures and does justice to the fresco's function as a devotional picture

31228-13nativ1.jpg	Among Piero's surviving paintings, the last one in chronological order is the Nativity in the National Gallery in London. The missing patches of colour, which might almost indicate that the painting is unfinished, are in fact probably the result of overcleaning.The Child lies on the ground, on a corner of Mary's cloak, following traditional Northern iconography which is reflected also in the features of the Child. Other elements of Northern culture can be found in a few naturalistic details, interpreted in a highly original fashion by Piero, such as the strange figure of St Joseph, nonchalantly sitting on a saddle, or the two animals in the background, depicted with great realism. No landscape view of Piero's is as miniaturistic as the city depicted in the background at the right: even the streets and the windows of the buildings are visible, just like in a landscape by Petrus Christus. Even the composition of the painting is quite innovative compared to Piero's previous production. The wide expanse of ground, dotted with patches of grass, and the roofing of the hut, with its shadow projecting onto the ruined brick wall, seem to indicate an attempt by the artist to fragment the space of the picture, breaking the rule that he had always rigorously abided by. The vanishing point is slightly raised, as in the Brera altarpiece, and gives one an almost bird's-eye view of the spectacular river landscape, which extends into the distance with trees, bushes and sheer rockfaces that remind one of some of the young Leonardo's drawings.These aspects of new perspective composition, of experimental naturalism and even of movement must be read as symptoms of the aging painter's incredible ability to update his art to the latest novelties being developed by Florentine and Netherlandish artists. But it is also clear that Piero could not have gone any further in this direction, for it would have meant abandoning the basic principles of his art. The directions that painters like Verrocchio and the young Leonardo were taking, with their almost scientific studies of action and movement, were leading too far away from the principles of spatial construction elaborated and developed by Piero and Alberti. Piero della Francesca's background culture, still very much alive in this last painting in the group of angels clearly inspired by Luca della Robbia's Cantoria in Florence Cathedral, was the 'heroic' environment of the early Renaissance, created in Florence by Brunelleschi and Donatello, by Leonardo Bruni and Paolo Toscanelli. Compared to the ideals of the earlier generation, the refined and courtly culture which was developing around the artistic patronage of Lorenzo the Magnificent, with its poetic Neo-Platonic abstractions and its archeological nostalgia for the romantic nature of classical antiquity, must have seemed superficial and ephemeral - almost a betrayal of its origins.

07843-03knight.jpg	"The young man, standing with his legs slightly apart, is shown as he unsheathes his sword: he dominates the landscape which is also depicted with a Flemish attention to detail. We can distinguish every species of flora and fauna, and with exactly the same accuracy and graphic perfection the profile of the knight on horseback stands out against the walls of the castle; in the foreshortened perspective of the section to the left we can make out a wooden sign of a horse at the gallop. On the opposite side, we can pick out every detail of the city built on the hillside; it is mirrored on the flat surface of the sea and almost blends in the background with the steep rocky mountains.What makes this portrait of the young knight even more fascinating is the unresolved enigma of his identity; he remains simply the extraordinary, idealized model of many protagonists of the Humanist world, the virtues of which are clearly referred to in the motto ""MALO MORI QUAM FOEDARI"" (Better to die than to lose one's honour) inscribed on the scroll to the left, above the ermine, a symbol of purity and integrity, while the peacock by the helmet of the armed soldier on horseback is a reference to immortality"

15111-virgin_c.jpg	"This small painting of the Madonna depicts a fragile female figure holding her newborn together with a vanquished dragon. The artist indicates her floating, vision-like quality with the use of fantastic lighting and an army of angels in concentric circles. By arranging the choir of angels in a manner reminiscent of spheres, it is also expressed that the infant Jesus in the centre of the picture is the ruler of the Universe. With a sweeping gesture and a look of concentration, the infant is shaking two bells, as if to be in concert with the angel doing the same thing on the left side of the picture. They are definitely looking at each other, and since they are the only two doing this, the action has special significance: it shows the ""conductor"" Jesus in the role of the universe's prime mover. Thus the painting clearly expresses a concept formulated by St Thomas Aquinas, according to which Jesus created the harmony of the spheres.In Geertgen's painting the three attributes of Mary (glory, sadness and joy) are represented by angels encircling the Madonna in three rings. The inner circle contains six-winged cherubs and seraphs. The angels of the second circle hold above the head of Mary the early Christian symbols of glorification, scrolls with the word ""Sanctus"" appearing on them three times. The rest bear the objects associated with the Passion: the cross, the crown of thorns, a spear, nails, a hammer, and a column. The outside circle presents a multitude of musical angels, symbolizing heavenly happiness. Here we can see nearly all of the instruments of the period: lutes, violas, double recorders, trumpets, drums, bells, horns, bagpipes, hurdy-gurdies, etc. The larger keyboard instruments are located in the corners; on the organ we can see the hand-operated bellows. Obviously, the painter did not intend to reproduce the image of a real orchestra, that is why he included instruments which were never used together"

05260-16allego.jpg	"The intimate association between Gluttony and Lust in the medieval moral system was expressed by Bosch in this fragment of a painting at Yale University. Gluttony is personified by the swimmers at the upper left who have gathered around a large wine barrel straddled by a pot-bellied peasant. Another man swims closer to shore, his vision obscured by the meat pie balanced on his head. This scene is followed, on the right, by a pair of lovers in a tent, another motif reminiscent of the Lust scene in the Prado ""Tabletop"". That they should be engaged in drinking wine is entirely appropriate: ""Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus"" (Without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus freezes); this tag from Terence was well known to the Middle Ages, and that Gluttony and Drunkenness lead to Lust was a lesson that the moralizers never tired of driving home to their audiences"

04469-market_w.jpg	Beuckelaer was Pieter Aertsen's nephew, and he painted similar market scenes. He frequently discarded the biblical scenes the presence of which is characteristic in Aertsen's market scenes. This painting presents a typical example. Here the market woman almost becomes an accessory to the over-abundant baskets and bowls containing a rich variety of fruit and vegetables that reach right up to the upper edge of the painting. In this way the artist tries to show the impressive quantitative results of the new agricultural methods. The greenish-purple iridescence of the cabbages, with their bizarre curls and wrinkly whirls, bears witness to improvements in fertilization, and the abundance of different kinds is meant to show the large number of refinements and crosses between the different fruits.The picture expresses an ambivalence towards this opulent fruitfulness, offering a criticism of the covetousness awakened by the sight of it, such a moral purpose being an integral element of the aesthetic presentation of the foodstuffs depicted. The offering of a bird was an unmistakable reference to carnal love (the word vogelen, which also has the sense of 'to bird', meaning 'to copulate'); cabbage was considered a symbol of the feminine, being traditionally served at weddings and, eaten with oil, it was also used as a kind of contraceptive, while carrots and gherkins were associated with the phallic and masculine. The other fruits, too, can be understood as metaphors for the whole gamut of feelings of love and lust. In displaying all these foods, the painting is a warning against carnal desire, lack of inhibition and excess

20496-johnbapt.jpg	"Small devotional images such as this were produced in large numbers by craftsmen and lesser-known artists for the homes of Florence's middle class. These artists often filled in at leading workshops when extra assistants were needed for important commissions. We know, for example, that Jacopo worked with Filippo Lippi, Ghirlandaio, and Botticelli.This painting reflects the concerns of Florentine merchants and their pride in the city. John the Baptist was the patron saint of Florence, and we see him here  before the city skyline. Clear in the distant landscape are the Palazzo Vecchio, center of the city administration; Brunelleschi's huge cathedral dome; and the campanile designed by Giotto. (It is one of our earliest painted views of Florence.) Other details  preserve a traditional, conservative religious outlook. The bowl at the saint's foot recalls his baptism of Christ, while goldfinches, whose red markings were believed to have been made by Christ's crown of thorns, remind viewers of the Crucifixion. Most telling is the axe sunken into the tree trunk at the left edge of the painting, which refers to Luke 3:9: ""every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down."" This was a pointed warning against the unorthodox beliefs of some of the city's patrician elite, echoing Savonarola's sermons against their dangerously paganlike tendencies"

03908-194madon.jpg	In its interpretation this painting shows similarity to the famous Madonna of Meadows in London. Altough the curtain (characteristic to the earlier period) returns to separate the holy group from the  surrounding landscape, a new vision that takes account of Giorgione's innovations, and absorbs them, blends the natural elements with the human presence.The analysis carried out on the occasion of the last restauration (1986) revealed the absence of a preparatory drawing in the landscape. This confirms that, while for the figures Bellini still felt the need to lay out the image beforehand, by this time he had a full and total confidence in the manipulation and figurative arrangement of the landscape. Over the preparatory ground he proceeded with light strokes, on which he often intervened with his fingertips.Even fifty years after the begining of his career Bellini has not abandoned the habit inherited from his father Jacopo of the sketch in a notebook and the single study from life. Here, then, is a tiny cheetah on the classical memorial stone, farming activities and animals. The result is a transparent landscape with a light, ordered structure. Although, in this respect, it is certainly still linked to the Quattrocento, the light is now so much the essence of it that it transforms and directs it toward tonalism. The organization of the image is quite unitary, also because it is bathed in a soft, gentle, auroral light that alludes to the dawn of a new era

32772-07colonn.jpg	This is the main panel and lunette from a relatively early work by Raphael, also known as the Colonna Altarpiece, painted for the convent of Sant'Antonio da Padova at Perugia. He began the work when he was barely 20 years old, just before he left for Florence in 1504, and he completed it the following year after he returned to Perugia.

18231-0501grec.jpg	Having the previous month signed the contract for The Disrobing of Christ for the vestry of Toledo Cathedral, in August 1577 El Greco was formally engaged by Diego de Castilla (1510/15-1584), dean of Toledo Cathedral, to paint three altarpieces for the Cistercian convent of Santo Domingo el Antiguo. The two side altars were to be decorated with The Adoration of the Shepherds and The Resurrection (still in situ), while the main altar received an enormous, multi-tiered altarpiece with six canvases that had as its focus The Assumption of the Virgin (signed and dated 1577, now in the Art Institute, Chicago) and The Trinity (Prado, Madrid). The complex was among the most ambitious of El Greco's career and constituted one of his finest achievements. The missing canvases - The Assumption of the Virgin, The Trinity, and the half-length figures of Saint Benedict and Saint Bernard - have been replaced by copies, so that the character of the altarpiece can still be appreciated.El Greco was supplied with plans of the church as well as designs for the frames of the lateral altarpieces drawn up by Juan de Herrera, Philip II's architect at the Escorial. El Greco had furnished drawings for the project and he promised to paint the specified scenes to the complete satisfaction of Don Diego and to remain in Toledo until the work was finished. Additionally, he was to superintend the design of the frames as well as of a tabernacle and five statues to adorn the main altarpiece - two of Prophets and three of Virtues (Faith, Charity and Hope). Like the frames, these statues were carved - with significant modifications - by Juan Bautista Monegro (c. 1545-1621), who was also responsible for the cherubs holding an escutcheon with the sudarium.This involvement with the frames of his altarpieces as well as with their sculptural adornment was to become typical of El Greco, who owned the architectural treatises of Vitruvius and Serlio and in Venice had learned to model figures in clay and wax to study elaborate poses. It was by means of his carefully articulated, almost rigorously classical frames that El Greco created a neutral foil for the agitated, spiritual world his paintings conjure up. In the great Assumption of the Virgin, the Apostle closest to the picture frame turns his back to the viewer, thus closing off the steep, notional space of the painting: the viewer is a distanced spectator. By contrast, in the smaller, lateral altarpiece of The Adoration of the Shepherds, a half-length figure of Saint Jerome seems to pose a book on the edge of the frame and turns to address the viewer, serving as a link between two worlds: he is painted in a distinctly more realistic style than the figures of The Adoration, positioned deeper in space, and he thus serves as a mediator between the real and the fictive.The Santo Domingo altarpieces were a fitting debut for Toledo's greatest artistic genius, newly arrived from Italy, his mind filled with the most advanced ideas about the possibilities of art as a communicator of ideas and as a vehicle for the expression of spiritual values

05583-01lament.jpg	The stylistic changes in Botticelli's late work are especially striking in the two paintings of the Lamentation over the Dead Christ (in Munich and Milan). Botticelli was reacting in these pictures to the new religious sensibility in Florence.The dead Christ is lying lifelessly on a fine cloth in his mother's lap, and she has fallen back in a swoon against the shoulders of his favourite disciple, John. The two Marys are gently supporting the head and feet of the crucified man. Mary Magdalene is fearfully and sorrowfully gazing at the crucifixion nails. St Jerome, St Paul and St Peter are observing the moving scene. The fervent gestures and postures of the figures express their grief at the death of Christ - a religious emotion intended to include the observer.Originally the painting was in the church of  San Paolino in Florence.

15467-3gigli.jpg	In 1482 Ghirlandaio received the official commission from the Signoria, the city government, to produce the decorations in the Sala dei Gigli in the town hall, the Palazzo Vecchio. Sandro Botticelli, Perugino and Piero del Pollaiolo had also been assigned to the task, but only Domenico accomplished the undertaking. The most important consideration in the Sala dei Gigli was that the overall effect had to be magnificent, and the purpose of the monumental public work was to express the pride of the city and Republic of Florence.Ghirlandaio divided one wall by means of painted pilasters, with three arches between them. The two outer arches are over a doorway and a blind window. The result is that the entire wall appears as a mighty triumphal arch. In the centre is St Zenobius, the patron saint of Florence, with two saintly deacons. In the tympanum above the bishop is a terracotta relief of the Madonna and angels, a work similar to many that were produced by the workshop of the Della Robbia family of artists. In the background on the left there is a view of Florence Cathedral. Under the side arches stand historical characters who embody civic and republican virtues. In these figures Ghirlandaio produced very detailed variations of Roman armor and the classical contrapposto postures, features portrayed with considerable archeological accuracy.In the Sala dei Gigli the pictorial scheme is grandiose and the ancient figures depicted in the higher part of the fresco have an extraordinary energy. The deacons in the centre, on the other hand, are weak, rather limp and monotonous, even in the colours, which have lost their original brightness and lustre.This work is not of a high quality. Already occupied with the Sassetti Chapel, which probably gave him more satisfaction, in the Sala dei Gigli he probably traced the outline of the painting only, leaving a large part of its execution to assistants. In addition to his two brothers David and Benedetto, and his brother-in-law Bastiano Mainardi, there were many other assistants: Bartolomeo di Giovanni, Francesco Granacci and Biagio d'Antonio di Firenze. It is impossible to attribute the responsibility to this or that assistant for the inferior parts of Ghirlandaio's fresco cycles, since he was also responsible for the parts that lack the animated style, vitality and mastery of colour that were present in others. From these sometimes considerable discrepancies we must form a jjudgment about his work that makes him at once a marvellous interpreter of people and situations, a calm, almost monotonous narrator, or a tired and empty artist at times in search of the best, at others yielding to a commonplace routine

10130-11religi.jpg	This is the earliest known painting by Cranach, executed for the Schottenkirche in Vienna.Cranach's style was fully formed and underwent little development after about 1515, and the highly finished, mass-produced paintings after that date suffer by comparison with the more individual works he painted in early adulthood. The paintings the 30-year-old artist did in Vienna were of a profoundly devotional kind set in the wild landscapes of the Alpine foothills, with ruins and windswept trees. These pictures show Cranach as an avant-garde artist of considerable emotional force, and one of the initiators of the Danube school. Notable among them is the Crucifixion in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.

23064-51maesta.jpg	One of the high points of small-scale Sienese painting is the so-called Small Maest&#224; by Ambrogio Lorenzetti. Though small, it is breathtakingly beautiful. First of all there is the dazzling gold setting off the Madonna's outline, with angels emerging from it. Then there is the quality of color. Rarely in early Italian art does one find such as intense red, and in almost no other work has the costly lapis lazuli of the blue been so well preserved. Each part of the scene demands individual attention: the extremely delicate ornamentation and draughtmanship of the draperies, the saints' faces, and the magnificent display of color of the flowers in the golden vase in the foreground.Of all the features of this unique painting, one does not at first notice its spatial organization. The radiance tends to mask the structure of the composition, yet this is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the work. Here Ambrogio has resolved an artistic challenge that he also set himself in a large Maest&#224; at Massa Marittima.

32794-30selfpo.jpg	The controversial Self-Portrait in the Uffizi is very similar to the Blessing Christ, but its poor state of conservation has prevented critics from attributing it objectively and definitively to Raphael. Nevertheless, many art historians consider it a work from the Florentine period. The soft light which pervades the portrait certainly recalls Leonardo, but the restless and problematic elements which Leonardo's complex figurative research present are absent. The intense representation of the youth shows no sign of internal tension. On the contrary, it communicates a serene observation of reality through a pictorial rendering rich in synthetic capacity

23415-crucifix.jpg	This painting belongs to the early part of the artist's career, when his figures were endowed with an emotional intensity inspired by Lippo Memmi and Simone Martini. It depicts the Crucifixion with the two thieves, the Madonna, Saint John and Mary Magdalene, and a pelican piercing its breast above. The panel was intended for private devotion. The miniature like detail of the pelican's nest above the cross is an interesting motif: according to legend, the pelican pierced her own breast with her beak to feed her chicks with blood from her own heart. This image of self-sacrifice was used in medieval art as a symbol of Christ's sacrifice for humankind and a parallel for the Eucharist

42759-1giusti.jpg	This altarpiece is referred to as the Pala Giustinian, since it was commissioned by Antonio Giustinian, provveditore della fabbrica (building inspector), who would have been the painter's paymaster.Clearly contrasting cool colours in the service of precise, dramatically constructed forms are the main characteristics of Veronese's first altar painting for a Venetian church. Infrared reflectography recently brought to light a surprising technical finding: originally, parts of the pictorial architecture in the background of the picture were differently arranged. In an early phase, the column behind Mary was roughly in the centre of the picture. As the painting proceeded, it was overpainted and moved right. Clearly not initially envisaged, therefore, was the awkward-looking pier fragment with its engaged half-column, whose relationship with the other architectural motifs produces inconsistencies of perspective.When Agostino Carracci copied the large painting around 1582, one of the things that he corrected was the harsh arris at the top of the pier

32759-03citta.jpg	"The presence of Peruginesque motifs in Raphael's work is still quite evident in the Crucifixion of 1502-1503, now in the National Gallery in London. This painting, showing the crucified Christ with the Virgin, St Jerome, Mary Magdalene, and John the Evangelist, originally formed the central part of an altarpiece commissioned for the Church of San Domenico in Citt&#224; di Castello. It is the first work that Raphael signed. The signature, ""Painted by Raphael of Urbino,"" documents his full artistic autonomy and indicates his background.The composition derives from other panels on the same subject painted by Perugino; for example, the imposing Chigi Altarpiece for Sant'Agostino in Siena. But the rigorous correspondences of gesture that distinguish Raphael's figures from the sentimental and obvious poses of the master, clearly set the young pupil apart. The faces are treated with a subtler chiaroscuro and the volumes are, as a result, more slender than those of Perugino. Thus Raphael - even though he is unwilling and, perhaps, unable to break away from Perugino's influence - shows his true temperament in this painting. This temperament includes an extraordinary feeling for proportion and an acute visual sensibility. It is even more evident in the two predella compartments - one in the Cook Collection in Richmond and the other in the Lisbon Gallery - with Stories from the Life of St Jerome."

15739-madonn_c.jpg	While the present Madonna is not a direct copy, the composition is evidently based on the central figures from the Madonna and Child attributed to Perugino in the Galleria Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples. Rather than show the figures full length, Giannicola ends the composition at the Madonna's knees and excludes the figures in the background. The Christ Child is heavily reliant on Perugino's design, while the face of the Virgin is painted very much in Giannicola's own idiom.

The incisive force of the line combines with rich and luminous colour to create the firmly modelled figures. The self-conscious statement of dramatic style became another pretext for the continuing polemic between Tintoretto and Titian. Dolce clearly alludes to it when, in his 'Dialogo della pittura' of 1558, he criticizes the unfortunate position of the princess, whom he takes to be St. Margaret, astride the dragon

19264-calypso.jpg	The story depicted in the present painting is narrated by homer in The Odyssey. Telemachus, Odysseus's son, and Mentor, Odysseus's long-time friend, go on a journey to find out news about Odysseus' whereabouts after he has been missing for twenty years. For seven of those years, he was imprisoned on the nymph Calypso's island, until the gods intervened and forced her to let him go. When Telemachus and Mentor shipwreck on her island, Calypso is still mourning the loss of her beloved Odysseus. She immediately recognizes the similarity between Odysseus and Telemachus, and knows that he is the son of the hero. She pretends not to know who he is, and tells him that no one is to enter her island. Telemachus tells her who his father is, and asks for her mercy. Calypso is so impressed by the youth, she offers him a warm greeting and shows him the natural beauty of her island. She reveals to him that his father Odysseus had in fact been to her island, and she laments his having left her broken-hearted. Telemachus regales her with stories of his adventures prior to his landing at her island.Hamilton's painting is dominated by the statuesque figure of Calypso who looks a powerful and seductive temptress in her classically inspired white dress casually wrapped to reveal her figure.The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London in 1791

39614-4david.jpg	Titian executed three ceiling paintings (Sacrifice of Isaac; Cain and Abel; David and Goliath) for the ceiling of the church Santo Spirito in Isola (now they are in the sacristy of Santa Maria della Salute in Venice). These paintings are characterized by the spiraling movement of the figures, the counterpoised poses and the strong intersecting diagonals. In these canvases we see Titian's Mannerism at its height.Titian uses a very unusual iconography in this painting.

15561-5preach.jpg	"On the third level there are two frescoes, side by side, that deal with the mission of Saint John the Baptist. In the picture on the right he is preaching, and in the next picture he is baptizing Christ. The same landscape is continued through both scenes, linking them to one another.The fifth scene of the cycle depicts the Preaching of St John the Baptist. ""The fifth contains the preaching to the multitudes showing the attention of the people in hearing new things..."" (Vasari).While St John in a fur robe is making didactic gestures and preaching about the coming of the Messiah to an intent group of listeners, Christ is already approaching. Unnoticed by the Baptist, who is pointing to his cross staff, Christ is stepping out of the background into the scene between the rocks.Worthy of note in the preaching scene, and typical of Ghirlandaio, is the group of women on the left, with a beautiful figure seen from behind. Another figure seen from behind is seated at the feet of the preaching Saint John. The naked sitting child is Ghirlandaio's quotation of classical sculpture"

23913-4seasons.jpg	Manfredi's picture has been interpreted as an allegory of the Four Seasons, linked to the iconography of the Five Senses and explained as the four ages of man exemplified by various phases of love. There can be little doubt that its primary theme is the Four Seasons. The four figures, crowded behind a stone slab laden with fruit, are clearly identifiable as Spring (a young woman crowned with roses and playing a lute), Autumn (the young man adorned with a Bacchic crown of grapes), Summer (a bare-breasted woman who turns and stares directly at the viewer) and Winter (a shivering old man in a fur hat who is wrapped in a blanket). Nevertheless, their arrangement does not suggest the normal progression of the year and their interaction suggests a second level of meaning.The rich array of fruit carefully placed before the figures is composed entirely of autumnal produce: grapes, pears, apples, figs, a pomegranate and a squash. This is clearly the domain of Autumn, who kisses the lute-playing Spring but at the same time embraces Summer, who wears a sprig of his wheat in her hair. Summer holds a small round transparent mirror as a symbol of the Origin of Love. Autumn's kiss and embrace signify that music is born of love, while Winter's exclusion is a sad reminder that in old age one is less inclined towards amorous sentiments.Manfredi's facial features and tightly compressed composition find close parallels in Caravaggio's Musicians. The brightly illuminated fruit, so carefully displayed on cold, grey stone, and Summer's frank confrontation of the viewer over her bare shoulder seem to recall Caravaggio's Sick Bacchus explicitly. Although two other versions of Manfredi's Four Seasons are known, he painted no other allegoric subjects.

22687-13funer.jpg	Among the more complex and monumental scenes in the fresco cycle of the Stories from the Life of St Stephen is the Funeral of St Stephen, wherein the right portion depicts the stoning of Saint Stephen which is continued on the adjacent wall. Or reading the situation differently, the stoning seems to have intruded upon the contiguous scene which is represented in the interior of a full-blown contemporary church. This scene is in the lowest zone, which is the last part painted according to usual practice, it is signed and dated 1460.The deceased saint is laid out on the central axis of the nave, distinguished by large columns and clustered pilasters, at a point which must be regarded as the crossing. The young and handsome deacon saint is laid out on his bier in the sweet sleep of death. He is surrounded by mourners, including two women seated on the ground, one of which may be the saint's mother.On either side are figures in modern dress who are in many cases portraits of persons in Prato. In the distance we notice the simply decorated main altar with only a cross, casting its shadow upon the curved surface of the niche-like apse. The spatial perspective is carefully worked out through the lines of the tiled floor and the coffered ceiling.In this scene, the body of the saint lies within a church setting, but at the right of the scene, through an open door, there  is a glimpse out onto the sharp incline of a mountain scape - a curious detail in the somber scene. Even more bizarre is the rugged rock that actually intrudes into the church interior. Compositionally, this rock outcrop links the funeral scene with the adjoining martyrdom of the saint.In these frescoes Lippi proves himself to be an inventive painter of first rank

28656-5cathed1.jpg	When Monet began his serial compositions in the late 1880s, which initially featured haystacks, then polars, and in the early 1890s the cathedral at Rouen, these works constituted a logical progression of his artistic interests. By constantly portraying the same subject, the variables determined by the time of the day and the lighting could be particularly strongly accentuated. Different times of day and a changing colour palette were substituted for innovative subject matter. Monet included the time of the day and the dominant colours in the respective titles of his paintings as a matter of course.Sometimes he worked simultaneously on two canvases, in order to be able to react immediately to changing light conditions. As a result, the subject of the picture receded further and further into the background. At first glance we can see the shape of a cathedral, but on closer inspection the cathedral architecture dissolves before our eyes into a vibrant ensemble, composed merely of a collection of brush strokes.The present version shows the fa�ade and the Tour Saint-Roman in the morning (harmony in white)

21866-henriett.jpg	Portraiture, which was to become the single most brilliant achievement of English painting in the 18th century, was a field dominated in the 17th century by foreign artists who received many commissions from the royal court. The leading exponents of this period were van Dyck and Lely. This portrait of Henrietta Maria, Queen of England is an idealized portrait.Henrietta Maria of France (1609-1669), the daughter of King Henry IV of France and Marie de M�dici, was the Queen consort of England, Scotland and Ireland as the wife of King Charles I. She was mother of two kings, Charles II and James II and grandmother of two queens and one king, Mary II, William III and Anne of Great Britain as well as paternal aunt of Louis XIV of France. She had married Charles I in 1625, but soon fell out of favour with Parliament and the people because of her support for English Catholics. Later, she tried in vain and with great personal commitment, to help her husband. After the execution of Charles I in 1649, she settled in Paris. In 1660, when her oldest son succeeded to the throne as Charles II of Great Britain and Ireland, Henrietta Maria returned to England where she lived as Dowager Queen and Queen Mother until 1665 when she returned permanently to France. She died at the age of 59 at the ch&#226;teau de Colombes, near Paris, marking the end of a turbulent life. She was buried in the French royal necropolis at the Basilica of St Denis.Lely portrays her here as a beautiful and dignified woman in royal dress with an expression of suffering on her lips and a look of aloof mourning in her eyes. This is no longer a Baroque representative portrait, but tends far more in the direction of an individual interpretative portrayal. The nature of her life's journey is hidden by her reserved facial expression

09012-07rebecc.jpg	In the 1640s Claude produced many of his most ambitious pictures, such as the two versions of the Landscape with Dancing Figures (sometimes called The Mill) in the Galleria Doria in Rome and the National Gallery, London (called The Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca). They are wide in scale and the atmosphere is of broad daylight. There is a complete balance between careful observation of the reality of the Roman Campagna and the need to produce an organized composition. Unfortunately both versions of the picture suffer from a problem afflicting a number of Claude's works, the darkening of the greens in the trees. This gives them a much greater solidity than the artist intended. Moreover, in Claude's later pictures there is also sometimes a fading out of the fugitive yellows he used, which gives the pictures a much stronger bluish hue than he intended.Painted in 1648, these two pictures sum up Claude s mature art. He had arrived at this maturity by degrees, almost imperceptibly, refining and perfecting his technique. He had for many years been drawing from nature almost obsessively, and several hundred of his sensitive and often atmospheric drawings survive. He was therefore able to combine the more naturalistic approach seen in the Ponte Molle of 1645 with an increasing desire to turn the landscape into an idealized world. He had tried dramatic atmosphere in some of his early compositions, and had succeeded with direct sunlight but had not pursued it; but he developed in his later years the soft and subtle light effects which were the most difficult of all to achieve convincingly. As he grew older Claude became even more meticulous, and his pictures never acquired the looseness sometimes seen in the works of painters in their old age, even Poussin.The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 113)

22653-1virgin.jpg	Criticism usually holds that this was painted about 1452 and that it is to be identified with a painting recorded documentarily as done for Lorenzo Bartolini.The painting (also called the Pitti Tondo) is one of the most celebrated and most beautiful works of Filippo Lippi. The shape of the circular panel, which was such a favourite in the Quattrocento for religious compositions, is used by the artist with perfect skill. The pure face of the Virgin coincides almost exactly with centre of the panel, as it is also the spiritual fulcrum. She and the Child, who is posed with infantile grace, constitute the principal object of veneration and of vision. The two lateral scenes, linked together by the beautiful figures of the women who approach the newly made mother, St Anne, lying on the bed on the left, form almost exactly two segments of the circle. In allusion to the future birth of the Virgin is the Meeting of Joachim and Anne at the Golden Gate on the right above - small figures which stand out in the luminous geometry of the walls, windows and staircase.The clearly marked drawing has a great importance in the painting of Filippo Lippi. His is a subtle line in continual movement and curve, repeating itself with the lightness of an arabesque around the slender, elongated figures. The utmost purification of the human form, as the artist loved it, appears in the sensitive and refined figure of the Virgin. To bring it into harmony with the delicacy of the line and its prepondering part, Lippi's colour has a great transparence, with light tones, somewhat subdued, and very subtle in their gradations: pinks, ivory whites and transparent greens

23048-4effect1.jpg	On the wall opposite the Effect of Good Government and to the left of the Good Government Ambrogio painted another fresco called Bad Government and the Effects of Bad Government on the City Life, which uses the same forms and compositional devices as the other frescoes in the room, but inverts them. The malevolent-looking figure representing Bad Government, pointedly labeled as Tyranny, is enthroned and stares hieratically out at the observer.. Neither male nor female, it is fanged, cross-eyed, and porcine, clearly bloated with corruption. In place of the cardinal virtues, personifications of Avarice, Pride, and Vainglory fly over its head. Tyranny is flanked by clearly labeled seated figures representing Cruelty, Treason, and Fraud at the left, and Frenzy, Divisiveness, and War at the right. A bound figure representing Justice lies at its feet. The city to its left is falling into ruin, robbers roam the streets, and, in the foreground, a group of ruffians drags a woman by her hair.

17767-418goya.jpg	Goya clearly had in mind for this royal group the composition of Vel�zquez's Meninas, which he had copied in an engraving many years before. Like Vel�zquez, he has placed himself at an easel in the background, to one side of the canvas. But his is a more formal royal portrait than Vel�zquez's: the figures are grouped almost crowded together in front of the wall and there is no attempt to create an illusion of space. The eyes of Goya are directed towards the spectator as if he were looking at the whole scene in a mirror. The somewhat awkward arrangement of the figures suggests, however, that he composed the group in his studio from sketches made from life. Goya is known to have made four journeys to Aranjuez in 1800 to paint ten portraits of the royal family. Since there are 12 figures in the group it is likely that the woman seen in profile and the woman whose head is turned away &#151; the only two whose identity is uncertain were not present at the time.Goya's magnificent royal assembly is dominated not by Charles IV but by the central figure of the Queen, Mar�a Luisa, whose ugly features are accentuated by her ornate costume and rich jewels. For some unknown reason this was the last occasion that Goya is known to have painted any member of this royal family, except for the future Ferdinand VII, who stands in the foreground on the left. The unusual figure composition on the wall behind the group has been identified as Lot and his Daughters, but no such painting has been identified

40867-10edelhe.jpg	"The triptych, painted for Wilhelm Edelheere, a patrician of Leuven, shows how unusual and impressive Rogier van der Weyden's Deposition must have been in its time - this is a very early case of an almost exact copy, for the fashion for such copies of Rogiers's pictures did not really set in until near the end of the century. However, Rogier's composition was obviously beyond the anonymous painter, who has not really succeeded in reproducing either the proportions as a whole or the individual figures. The niche Rogier painted is deep enough at the bottom of the picture to accommodate several figures, the upright of the Cross, and the ladder leaning against it; but in some areas at the top it seems to come close to the surface of the picture - the helper on the ladder is pressed tightly into the shallow upper space of the shrine, while the head of the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea just below seems to protrude from the picture. All the figures are brought forward by the golden back wall so that the space surrounds them closely: convincing as their actions may look individually, there would never really have been room for them all. The result is a sense of timelessness and an almost oppressive intensity. The lesser painter of the Edelheere Altarpiece could obviously not understand this effect, and ""corrected"" the picture: his copy makes the painted niche deep enough throughout to give the figures enough space. He also enlarged the size of the Cross, thus presenting something that really does resemble a painted carved altar, with doll-like figures performing the scene of a Deposition.In the wings showing portraits of the family, however, he was able to give his own abilities free rein, to better effect. The donors are shown being recommended by their patron saints, on the left St James the Greater, on the right St Elisabeth of Thuringia"

32333-01ignazi.jpg	During the construction of the church of Sant'Ignazio, there was a dispute with the Dominicans of Santa Maria sopra Minerva who objected the planned cupola because it would have stolen light from their library. It was recommended by the architect Mattia de'Rossi, that the cupola problem could be resolved by having one painted instead of actually built. The architecture painter and Jesuit lay brother Andrea Pozzo was selected for the commission, which was completed in 1685.The effect of the simulated cupola rests largely on the figural groupings on the pendentives, which were executed immediately after the canvas with the painted cupola was put in place. Painted on actual concave pendentives, they make the sham cupola more believable, especially when viewed from the entrance. The monumental figures (Judith, David, Samson, Jael) have an imposing physicality, emphasized by their bright colours and strong contrasts.The fresco in the apse calotte was executed in 1687-88. It shows St Ignatius floating downward on a cloud as a helper of Rome's sick and poor. Here the painter produced a seemingly two-dimensional image on a concave surface. The antechoir vault fresco, painted at the same time, depicts the Vision of St Ignatius at the Battle of Pamplona.Pozzo secured the commission for painting of centre aisle in 1688. He worked on St Ignatius in Glory, The Four Corners of the World, and the Mission of the Jesuit Order for five years until the unveiling in July, 1694.The painted program in the church was completed in 1697-98 by frescoes on the right transept vault (Vision of St Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi) and on the tribune wall (three scenes from the lives of Jesuit saints). The left transept was frescoed only in 1720 with the Assumption of the Virgin by Ludovico Mazzanti.In the artistic skill and trompe-l'oeil technique the decoration of Sant'Ignazio could not be surpassed. For Rome such virtuosity in perspective was both a climax and a conclusion

42541-02praxid.jpg	Signature: Signed(?) twice: MEER 1655 lower left. MEER N... .R. Lower right.Provenance: Of all the recently proposed attributions destined to enlarge the body of Vermeer's so-called youthful period, this one is the most questionable. It has a checkered history. Discovered in 1943 in a small New York auction room by a couple of Belgian refugees, the late Jacob Reder and his wife, it was for a long time turned down by all Vermeer specialists. Jacob Reder, who dabbled in the Old Masters trade long before coming to America, was well known as an eccentric with a powerful imagination. After his death, the painting was acquired from his widow by a New York (now Los Angeles) dealer. From there, it passed into the collection of the current owner.The painting is probably an Italianizing copy after a minor Florentine artist. Some connoisseurs believe that this copy was executed by an Italian in his customary technique. Others are inclined to admit that the painting could have been done by a northern artist, in close imitation of the Florentine original. The latter exists: it is by Felice Ficherelli (1605-69?) and belongs to a private collector in Ferrara. In any case, it is a mediocre painting. The main difference from the Florentine original is the cross in the hands of the saint, which was probably added at the request of a convent or church that had commissioned the work.An attribution to Vermeer finds its sole basis in the two signatures, because neither style nor pictorial quality are anywhere close to the artistic level of Vermeer. It is extremely important to remember in this context, that false Vermeer signatures occur often and were probably affixed sometime during the eighteenth or nineteenth century. If such an inscription is two hundred years old, as compared with the age of roughly three hundred years for the painting, the contemporaneity becomes almost impossible to prove either way by so-called scientific methods.An attribution to Michael Sweerts could possibly be considered

18709-1ospeda1.jpg	The Ospedaletto is the smallest of the four large hospitals that were built by the venetian government in the sixteenth century to care for the poor and the ill, who converged on the city in great numbers, seeking shelter from famine, war, and recurring plague. It was originally a simple, temporary wooden structure, but over time it was transformed into a grand building with its own church designed by Palladio and completed by Longhena. The restoration, renovation and expansion of the hospital continued in the eighteenth century, and the last project was the creation of the Music Room in 1777 by Francesco Patron.The Music Room was built over the kitchens of the old hospital for music schools that entertained important guests. The Ospedaletto became famous for its choral group made up of the young orphan girls educated at the institute. The young girls sang in public concerts and in doing so hoped to win a rich husband.Jacopo Guarana was entrusted with the decoration of the Music Room. The elegant trompe-l'oeil architecture that serves as a setting for Guarana's scenes was created by Agostino Mengozzi Colonna, son of the renowned quadraturist Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna. The decoration of the space is divided into two parts, one dedicated to the world of allegories, the other to the real world. The ceiling contains a representation of the triumph of Music, while the back wall celebrates the true protagonists, the young women (or putte), who played music in the room every day.

35119-samuel.jpg	The story is taken from the Old Testament ((I Sam. 28). On the eve of a battle with the Philistines, Saul, the king of Israel feeling himself forsaken by God in a critical hour, consulted a necromancer, the witch of Endor, to know what the future held. He commanded her to call up the spirit of the prophet Samuel who, during his lifetime, had been Saul's mentor and the grey eminence behind the throne. Samuel, the last Judge of the Israelites, had himself anointed Saul as their first king. In a cantankerous mood at being recalled from the Shades, Samuel foretold the worst, that neither Saul nor his sons would survive the morrow. In the ensuing battle his three sons were slain and Saul, wounded, threw himself on his own sword rather than meet death at the hands of the uncircumcised.In Rosa's painting Saul is shown on his knees before Samuel who rises, shrouded, from the earth, while spectral monsters float in the gloom

26713-lu08ozi.jpg	"""Joram begat Uzziah. Uzziah begat Jotham. Jotham begat Ahaz."" (Matthew 1:8-9)The symmetry of the poses of the principal figures appears to be studied: the torsos of both are seen frontally, but they face outward in opposite directions. The boy in the foreground, in front of the woman, reinforces the plastic equilibrium of the scene; and there is decidedly sculptural and monumental emphasis in the two groups that seem to be compressed into the limited space of the lunette.Under a loose green mantle, the man on the left - traditionally considered to be Jotham accompanied by his son Ahaz - is wearing a yellow tunic with lilac shadows on the shoulder and arm; these echo the colour of his cap, which is tied to his head with purple ribbons. In a relaxed attitude, leaning forward with his arm resting in his lap, he gazes with parted lips at a point that the boy behind him is indicating. The right part of the lunette is dominated by the tonality of the heavy reddish-orange mantle with deep yellow shadows that the woman presses to her breast. Although her gaze is not directed at them, she seems to be protective toward the two children by her"

35875-dianaact.jpg	The story with Diana and Actaeon was a favourite with the late Mannerist painters. This is understandable, because the myth, particularly in Ovid's playful, witty and lively presentation, contains both stimulatingly erotic and shivering horror story elements and thus was perfectly suited for the contemporary spirit. In Ryckere's painting, the nymphs, interrupted in their bath and toilette, turn toward the wandering hunter who descends toward their hiding place on a staircase carved into rock. The change in him is already beginning and the water of the spring scattered on him has made his head turn into that of an antlered deer. However, the action remains weightless, the painting is in fact a landscape decorated with puppet-like figures.The painting is signed on the rock at left: 1582 B. D. Ryckere

32517-lastjudg.jpg	If Isenbrant and Benson were not always very original, the same cannot be said of Jan Provost (1465-1529) or Lanceloot Blondeel (1498-1561). Both painters introduced their own, new spirit to their respective generations in Bruges. Rather than basing their art on a few poorly understood and arbitrarily selected Italian features, they opted for a more ingenious thematic and decorative approach and for their own special modernity. They were complex personalities, who also worked as cartographers, engineers and architects, making them early exponents of the universal artistry that typified the age of Humanism.The Last Judgment, the only painting whose attribution to Provost is confirmed by documentary evidence, comes from the Town Hall for which it was painted in 1525. Its carved frame, still partly original and possibly designed by Blondeel, is an example of the ingenious ornamentation that flourished around these Bruges artists. The iconography of the jjudgment scenes differs significantly from what was traditional at the time. The symbolic relationship between Jesus and Mary, the carrying of the blessed across the water and the hellish pageant of friars and nuns, reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch, are expressive of a lively imagination.

Del Monte purchased the building in 1596.On his eagle, Jupiter swoops down towards Neptune and Pluto, who are standing at the opposite edge of the ceiling, as if he were making the sky light up with a crystal ball.

38950-01virgi6.jpg	"In Venetian Cinquecento paintings of the Madonna, the Virgin and Child are usually represented in a terrestrial environment, with a landscape background, in the company of saints. This type of ""santa conversazione"" was subsequently altered to suit the taste of the baroque era: in most instances the Virgin Mary, floating among clouds, appears to the saints situated in earthly regions. As in the Budapest canvas and in a number of other pictures by Tiepolo, the painter conveys a vision, an apparition, seeking to establish a connection between celestial and earthly elements.Most likely the Budapest picture was painted for some pious brotherhood. Its airily receding architecture, the marvellous purity of its resplendent colours, the harmony of construction are similar to Tiepolo's works of the years 1737 to 1740, The Virgin with Six Saints was probably produced simultaneously with pictures in the church of Gesuati, and the lost St Augustine altarpiece of San Salvatore"

44225-seasons2.jpg	Jacob de Wit, a leading representative of Dutch ceiling painting was responsible for a seasonal cycle commissioned by Landgrave Wilhelm VIII for the great galleried hall at Schloss Wilhelmsh�he. This cycle is characteristic of De Wit's works in grisaille, generally allegorical representations of putti, which were popular and internationally sought-after decorations. With their graduated greys, these works - sometimes called 'witjes', in a pun on the name Wit, meaning white - imitate stone bas-relief. The theoretical architectural function of the works is clearly expressed in their organisation as niches with a stele in each.The divinity appropriate to each of the seasons is represented by a bust on a plinth, while a small crowd of putti make merry play with the god's attributes. Summer is represented by Ceres, the thyrsus staff with its pine-cone, the wine-jar and the jug, are all traditional iconographical representations of the season.

44039-0john.jpg	The sequence of panels, from left to right, corresponds to the sequence of events. The baptism of Christ, the most important action performed by John the Baptist, comes in the central panel between his naming (left) and his execution (right). Christ is thus at the exact center of the entire altarpiece. The archivolt reliefs narrate events connected with each of the main scenes below them, and the statues in the wall niches represent the Twelve Apostles.Van der Weyden constructed the portal to look like that of a real church. The grisaille paintings portray archivolt figures as well as saints in scenes which parallel the main motifs. The church fa�ade is therefore not only a holy place, but also a pictorial element that sets the event firmly in a biblical context. At the same time, the spiritual world becomes accessible to the secular world: scenes appear from everyday life and the view gives on to a vista that includes a landscape and a town in the distance. It is here that van der Weyden's concept of art meets van Eyck's. The sacred fuses with the everyday and it is towards the latter that the holy events are oriented. The differences between the two artists cannot of course be ignored: while van Eyck's treatment of the contact between the sacred and the secular was free and light, van der Weyden insisted on a strict separation.The St John Altarpiece represents a new version of the Miraflores Altarpiece (Staatliche Museen, Berlin) in its pictorial construction. As in the Miraflores Altarpiece, three portals are decorated with relief and sculptural ornamentation, complementing the narrative content. Interestingly, however, parts of the real frame no longer run three-dimensionally across the panels, enhancing the plasticity of the painted architecture; instead, the impression is of a relatively shallow fa�ade set slightly back. The main figures are on the same level as the portals, while in the Miraflores Altarpiece the space farther back is also opened up.The shallow zone of the foreground is set off by the strong effects of depth in the side panels, where the rooms are almost like tunnels. This makes the narrative backgrounds of the left and right panels subordinate. The foreground and background areas are entirely separate in perspective too: as in the Miraflores Altarpiece, we have a full frontal view of the individual portals with the main figures at the front of them, so that the viewer might be standing directly in front of each panel. The backgrounds, on the other hand, are seen as if from a single viewpoint in front of the central panel, with the areas at the sides converging toward the middle and emphasizing the significance of the central event

The clothes of the four saints are animated and rippled into vibrant surfaces and the architectural elements are finely sculpted and gilded in relief decoration.The sharpness of his observation reveals to what extent Lippi had studied the work of Leonardo, although his use of bright colours - reds, blue and deep purple demonstrates that he followed his own line of personal inspiration

07515-24conta.jpg	Nothing that Caravaggio had done before was equal in scale, majesty or beauty to the first painting he produced for the Contarelli Chapel in San Luigi dei Francesi, the French Church in Rome. The Martyrdom of St Matthew hangs on the right wall of the Contarelli Chapel and is lit from the left, as if from the window behind the altar.The location is the steps up to a Christian altar, with a Greek cross marked on its frontage, and a candle burning. In the background on the left, we can just make out the shaft of a column in the almost impenetrable darkness. Steps ascend parallel to the picture towards the altar at the back. They also appear on the left, where churches do not normally have steps. For this reason some experts have claimed to detect a baptismal font in the foreground, especially as men are lying nearby, half-naked. On the left, a man is leaning against a step. He has no more concrete a role than two youths crouching in the foreground on the right, staring at the main action. They form the right-hand border of the composition, like river-gods on classical reliefs.The picture's main figure is also half-naked. This is not the martyr, but his executioner. In terms of stroboscopic figures, his feet are level with the falling figure to his left. He has emerged from the depth of the picture to stand near the altar. This is hard to understand in a pictorial narrative which ought to be clarifying the passage of time in spatial terms. Insofar as the murderer has associated himself with the half-naked man in the foreground, left, the fall of the latter suggests that his power will also be shortlived.Yet what Caravaggio is really depicting is the murderer's moment. He has thrown St Matthew, a bearded old man, to the ground. As a priest, he is wearing alb and chasuble. Whilst his victim helplessly props himself up on the ground, the Herculean youth seizes his wrist in his right hand, to hold the victim still for the death-blow. Yet the apostle's attempt to ward off his murderer, with his furious face, turns into a different gesture as an angel extends a martyr's palm-leaf to his open hand

18887-allegory.jpg	"Recent literature connected this picture to a 1637 payment made to Guercino by the community of Cento for a Pittura e Scultura, a canvas that the city presented to Cardinal Colonna, Archbishop of Cento. This is confirmed by the high quality of the picture, and by stylistic characteristics that place it solidly within Guercino's production in the 1630's. In this phase of his career, while not abandoning his rich, heavily impasted manner of painting, the drama of which is underscored by flickering flashes of light, Guercino was shifting (under the influence of Reni) towards more classical compositions and a less shrill chromatic range.With the figures arranged with stern flatness along a single plane, the treatment of space in this painting is almost relief-like. This compositional restraint is broken only by the edge of ""Painting""'s canvas, which juts audaciously out towards the viewer. The clean profile of the face of ""Painting"" is also notable: in its unnatural rigidity, it seems to derive from an engraving. Other passages, however, reveal the extreme pictorial liberties taken by Guercino who, for example, leaves the red ground of the canvas visible, using its tone for the rendering of shadows in the flesh. Also the thumb of ""Painting"" is shown realistically dirtied with actual paint; while the hand of ""Sculpture"" can be seen through the drapery of the statue she holds, as if the drapery is of real transparent cloth instead of marble.The refined Cardinal Colonna, recipient of this gift, already possessed a choice collection of artworks. In the context of the commission, the allegorical theme of painting and sculpture can be considered Cento's homage to the Archbishop's passion for collecting and patronage of the arts.A preparatory design for the figure of ""Painting"" has been found at the Teylers Museum (Haarlem, the Netherlands)."

15980-30allego.jpg	In the chapterhouse of a cloister Obedience rules between two observers, the dual-faced Prudence (Prudentia) and the quiet Humility (Humilitas). Obedience commands silence and places the yoke upon the monk who kneels before her. Francis, who stands on the roof of the building like an apparition between two kneeling angels, also bears such a yoke.The embodiment of Presumptuousness, the horned centaur, is denied entrance. Two young men, a monk of the order and a layman, will follow in the footsteps of the saint. An angel has already taken one of them by hand. Interestingly, however, it seems to be Prudence who presides over such a decision: with her dual face she sees both past and future.

41461-j_paris.jpg	"This painted dish may have been given as a wedding present to a newly married couple. The theme, suited to the occasion, is a story connected with a wedding. Paris, who had not been invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, threw a golden apple inscribed ""For the Fairest"" among the guests. In the upper left part of the picture the three goddesses vying for the prize are depicted. The decision was left to Paris, who chose Aphrodite.We know that the cult of antiquity played a major role in the emergence of the Italian Renaissance. Although the classic artistic idiom remained alien to the upper classes of Florence, they did like the stories of antiquity. These legends, precious for their very antiquity (their origins lost in the mists of ancient history), were considered to be part of these people's glorious heritage. They had the stories represented in the most fashionable and elegant manner, in the sophisticated idiom of the International Gothic style, putting themselves into the roles of the elegant heroes of mythology, but attired in the clothes of the patrons' own period. (It may be suspected that in both groups of the goddesses, Aphrodite is the bride herself, while Paris is an idealized likeness of the bridegroom.)The scene in the foreground takes place in a bare, rocky landscape, whilst the preceding episode occurs on a verdant lawn, in front of a dense forest. The different localities are separated by two imagined straight lines, intersecting near the middle of the circle. The steep rise of the ground bars a view of the horizon and thus an enclosed, homogeneous field is created, which felicitously fits the circular frame, which is also an enclosed shape. The precipice separating the beholder from the foreground and the impenetrable woods which close down the background also contribute to the creation of the unified internal world of the picture.The painter of this ornamental dish is referred to as the Master of the Judgment of Paris. He is probably Cecchino da Verona, who originated from Northern Italy, but was active in Florence. He found an ingenious solution to distinguish the deities of Greek myths from ordinary mortals, without endowing the former with the halo due to the saints of Christianity: the goddesses wear golden diadems, which resemble aureoles, but do not wholly surround their heads."

09010-06landsc.jpg	The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 107).Like Nicolas Poussin, Claude Gell�e, a native of Lorraine, went to Italy while still young and lived and worked in Rome as an honoured member of the artists' colony. Italian painters being on the whole not greatly attracted towards the painting of pure landscapes, the genre was first explored in the North and was introduced into Italy by painters from the Netherlands, Germany and France. The French painters, Poussin, Claude and Poussin's nephew, Gaspard Dughet, created a specific kind of landscape, known as the 'ideal landscape', introducing mythological or legendary figures and often creating a pleasing harmony by blending elements of reality with antique ruins or classical buildings. To all this Claude added a specific quality of his own - a magic evocation of mood, an exquisite shading of atmospheric elements and subtlety of lighting.The painting in Budapest depicts a villa in the country near Rome, the house and the landscape bathed in the gentle light of the late afternoon sun; in the foreground, where the shadows have already lengthened, the surface of the water reflects the figures of the shepherd and his flock. The drawing for this picture is in the Duke of Devonshire's collection at Chatsworth; the inscription on the back of the drawing tells us that the picture was painted for Prince Pamphilj, probably some time in the 1640s.The artist painted another version at about the same time, it is in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.

The bridle and measuring rod are the attributes of Nemesis, thus in this allegory the man assumes the role of Nemesis			
33038-10trans.jpg	Cardinal Giulio de' Medici commissioned the Transfiguration in 1517 to Raphael for the French Cathedral of Narbonne. Bad health prevented Raphael from finishing it. The painting, however, remained in Rome in San Pietro in Montorio after 1523. Taken to Paris 1797, it was brought back in its present location in 1815.The composition of the Transfiguration is divided into two distinct parts: the Miracle of the Possessed Boy on a lower level; and the Transfiguration of Christ on Mount Tabor, in the background. The transfigured Christ floats in an aura of light and clouds above the hill, accompanied by Moses and Elijah. Below, on the ground, are his disciples. Some are dazzled by the light of glory, others are in prayer. The gestures of the crowd beholding at the miracle link the two parts together: the raised hands of the crowd converge toward the figure of Christ. In this very grand composition Raphael has summed up all the elements present in the best of contemporary painting, including references to classical antiquity, Leonardo da Vinci (without doubt based on his recall of impressions garnered during his stay in Florence) and - not without a certain narcissism - himself. The works set the stage (just as surely as Michelangelo's Doni Tondo) for Mannerism.The numerous drawings (both by Raphael and pupils) for the characters in the painting, together with the number of variants of the first draft which were revealed by restoration work in 1977, show just exactly how carefully meditated a composition it is. The restoration also dispelled any doubts as to the authenticity of the attribution to Raphael; the retouching and corrections are proof that the painting (although unfinished) is actually entirely in his hand.The Transfiguration is the last bequest of an artist whose brief life was rich in inspiration, where doubt or tension had no place. Raphael's life was spent in thoughts of great harmony and balance. This is one of the reasons why Raphael appears as the best interpreter of the art of his time and has been admired and studied in every century.On 6 April 1520, precisely 37 years after he was born, Raphael died in Rome, the city that he had helped make the most important centre of art and culture that had ever existed

35389-03erect.jpg	Rubens painted the triptych for the high altar of Antwerp's church of St Walpurgis, which was demolished in 1817. That explains the inclusion of Amand, Walpurgis and Eligius on the back side of the wings.The triptych marked Rubens' sensational introduction of the Baroque style into Northern art. The diagonal composition is full of dynamism and animated colour. The artist had just returned from Italy, with the memory of Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Venetian painting still fresh in his mind. The Raising of the Cross is the perfect summation of the unruly bravura that marked his first years in Antwerp.In the centre nine executioners strain with all their might to raise the cross from which Christ's pale body hangs. The dramatic action is witnessed from the left by St John, the Virgin Mary and a group of weeping women and children. On the right, a Roman officer watches on horseback while soldiers in the background are crucifying the two thieves. In other words, the subject is spread across all three panels. The outside of the wings shows Saints Amand, Walpurgis, Eligius and Catherine of Alexandria.The painting was confiscated by the French in 1794 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Antwerp in 1815, following the defeat of Napoleon, and installed in the church of Our Lady.During restoration in the 1980s, successive layers of varnish, which had form an even grey veil over the painting, were removed. The burgeoning talent of the confident young Rubens is more clearly visible now in the intense emotion of the figures, the contrasting lighting, the glow of the labouring bodies and the gleam of the armour and costly robes

39293-2mark.jpg	"This painting was executed for the hall of the Scuola Grande di San Marco with three other canvases (now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice).A masterpiece of Tintoretto's full maturity, this painting is a profound expression of his originality. It creates a lyric spectacle out of extreme disquietude. In fact, it expresses a visionary notion that borders on the hallucination, and in this way the scene of the stealing of the body becomes a meteoric display. A memorable image is created that has the impact of a clap of thunder at a witches' ritual.It has recently been shown that this picture does not, as was long assumed, show the rediscovery of the body of St Mark on June 25, 1094, but various miracles of healing worked by the patron saint of Venice: he is depicted raising a man from the dead, restoring a blind man's sight, and casting out devils. As in The Miracle of the Slave, which he painted for the same location, Tintoretto illustrates the power of St Mark by placing the invisible guidelines of his construction of the perspective in the saint's outstretched hand. The donor Tommaso Rangone, who claimed great healing powers for himself, thereby making large sums of money, had his own figure painted kneeling humbly, but none the less wearing the magnificent golden robe of a cavalier aurato. Doge Girolamo Priuli had only recently bestowed the title of ""Golden Knight"" on him.Tintoretto has adopted here and carried further the expressive means of Tuscan and Roman Mannerism. There is the explosive perspective (note how the peak of the visual pyramid coincides with the raised hand of the saint performing the miracle). There are the dynamic crossing of the compositional diagonals, the nervous contortion and the bold foreshortening of the figures. Then there is the light from various sources that erupts from the tombs or spreads from the mouth of the long hall, like a nocturne in the porticoes of St Mark's. It prints rainbow along the bays, leaving an impression of instability and obsession. Finally there is the macabre element of the tomb-robbing scene and the anxiety of the jumble of figures in the foreground. Unreality reaches a peak in the pictorial rendering. The disintegration of the colour, an inheritance from Titian's late work, is seen in the dissociation of the brushstrokes from the material and their flickering, like a multitude of flames, against a somber and blurred surface"

16576-appearan.jpg	From the beginning of the fifteenth century on, painters increasingly shifted their focus away from the adoration of the child in Bethlehem and onto the kings' western journey. The journey gave them a greater opportunity to include narrative motifs and develop a chronological sequence in their picture. One striking example  (before the famous cycle by Benozzo Gozzoli in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, Florence) is the Journey of the Magi on the south wall of the Bolognini chapel in San Petronio in Bologna, painted in about 1412. There the painter Giovanni da Modena created a cycle in eight scenes to supplement an eschatological program that includes depictions of heaven and hell. He first shows us the kings setting out, then the appearance of the star. A total of six scenes, distributed over two registers, are required to get the caravan to Bethlehem, whereas the actual adoration and presentation of gifts is dealt with in a single panel. This is then followed by a scene rarely depicted, the kings' return journey by sea, undertaken out of a desire not to have to see Herod again

08458-betrayal.jpg	Giovan Pietro Bellori, in a marginal note to Giovanni Baglione, called this work Cavaliere d'Arpino's most beautiful painting. Like so many of his works from this period, it is carefully executed - as befits a relatively small work on copper - and subtle in colour. Most exceptional is the handling of the two light sources, the moon and the artificial light that illuminates the figures. It is likely that the composition and the prominence given to the episode of St Peter cutting off the ear of Malchus were influenced by D�rer's 1510 woodcut of the same subject from The Large Passion. Despite obvious differences, it is likely that Caravaggio's Taking of Christ was inspired in part by Cavaliere d'Arpino's example. Caravaggio also used two different light sources in his half-length composition, the unseen moon and a lantern held by a figure thought to be a self-portrait of the artist. Furthermore, it has been suggested that Caravaggio took Cavaliere d'Arpino's lead in utilising D�rer prints for elements of his composition.The importance of Cavaliere d'Arpino's Betrayal can also be measured by the fact that the Utrecht Caravaggesque painter Dirck van Baburen seems to have followed it rather than Caravaggio's painting in the canvas of the same subject that he painted in his early years in Rome. Interestingly, when the young Dutchman painted his second Taking of Christ around 1619, for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, he emulated Caravaggio's composition rather than that of Cavaliere d'Arpino. For the next generation of artists like Baburen and his contemporaries in Rome, Cavaliere d'Arpino's picture, despite its obvious skill and beauty, soon lost its appeal. These young painters, fighting for recognition towards the end of the second decade of the seventeenth century, quickly turned directly to Caravaggio and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Nevertheless, Caravaggio himself continued to value Cavaliere d'Arpino as an artist and to study works like the Betrayal, although his results are quite different

32076-slorenzo.jpg	"Pordenone underwent his early training as a painter in an artistic context still heavily influenced by Mantegna. Subsequently he experienced a multiplicity of different fashions and styles in Venice, Ferrara, Loreto, Rome and Urbino where he came into contact  with Giorgione, Titian, Sebastiano del Piombo, Melozzo da Forli, Raphael and Michelangelo. The taste which arose from this wide-ranging education was marked by an expressive Mannerist vitality that found itself in conflict in Venice with the courtly classicism of Titian. Such expressive passion loses some of its intensity in the later phase of Pordenone's career and under the refined Mannerist influence of Parmigiano his figure groupings became more studied and tightly organized.It is to this last period of Pordenone's activity that the great altar-piece of St Lorenzo Giustiniani belongs, with the saint pictured standing between two ""fratelli turchini"" and St Francis and St Augistine on the left and St Bernardino and St John the Baptist on the right. The work was completed in 1532 for the church Madonna dell'Orto where the Canons of San Giorgio in Alga (the fratelli turchini, so-called because of the blue-green colour of their vestments) celebrated mass. In the play of light and shade achieved with considerable dramatic tension by means of the circular sky-light in the architectural structure, the figures of the saints are presented as a magnificent series of interlocking shapes, a dense interweaving of sentiments"

14458-304fried.jpg	This painting seems fairly realistic at first sight. The composition is not the product of a single, specific visual impression, however, but is highly artificial, being composed of no less than six individual studies which Friedrich executed between 1806 and 1810. The landscape-format composition presents a plain extending without interruption into the background, seen as if the viewer were standing on the gentle rise which begins in the bottom left and right-hand corners. From here, our gaze falls upon a small pond - to which no path leads - and upon a huge oak tree, which looks at first sight to be fairly close by. Once our eyes have also registered the diminutive figure of a shepherd leaning against its trunk, however, the tree suddenly appears further away and hence gigantic. Aspects of proximity and distance are permanently chafing against each other throughout the painting, whereby rational everyday experience is thwarted by visual irrationality. While an idyll of unspoilt nature unfolds around the oak and the shepherd, the villages and church spires of the land developed by man are as it were concealed and compressed within a valley by the mountains and the sky high above. All this points to an overall symbolism in which the oak tree, monumentalized to the status of protagonist, is a metaphor for growth and decay or for human life in general.The painting's identically-sized pendant, the Moonrise by the Sea, is also in the Nationalgalerie, Berlin.

41474-olivieri.jpg	"This portrait is among the first from the Renaissance. During the late Middle Ages, depictions of individual donors had often been included in religious paintings, but it was not until the early fifteenth century that independent portraits were commissioned. The earliest ones are simple -- even austere -- profile views. They were likely influenced by portrait busts and the profile heads on ancient gems and coins, which were avidly collected by Renaissance humanists. The popularity of the independent portrait was spurred by a new focus on the individual and an appreciation of individual accomplishments, the new concept of fame.Matteo Olivieri's portrait -- his name appears on the ledge -- was originally paired with one of his son Michele, who may have commissioned both works. Though painted long after Matteo had died (he left a will in 1365), the portrait depicts a young man, as did the portrait of his son, who must have been at least sixty-five when the works were painted. Most portraits were probably commissioned as commemorations of the deceased by families who wished to remember them in the prime of life. As the Renaissance art theorist Alberti noted, a portrait ""like friendship can make an absent man seem present and a dead one seem alive."

07440-noli_me.jpg	Caracciolo was one of the first and most important Neapolitan exponents of the Caravaggesque trends straddling luminism and naturalism between 1607 and 1615. Around 1618, however, the artist turned to monumental forms and carefully studied compositional solutions, taking up the example of Annibale Carracci in particular. The attribution of the present painting to Caracciolo was confirmed when his initials were noted on the vase of ointment.Regarding the iconography of Christ wearing a gardener's hat, the same solution had been adopted in the sixteenth century in some cases, e.g. by Lavinia Fontana

37882-thebaid.jpg	The painting was attributed for long time to various artists, among them to Fra Angelico. Sometimes it is listed as an early work by Fra Angelico. Finally, it was recognised as a work by Gherardo Starnina. The content of the Thebaid shows that it was executed on the commission of one of the Mendicant Orders. The work depicts the life of a certain saint and the desert life of a large number of hermits, an iconographical theme whose origins are to be found in Pisan art. The painting is occupied entirely by numerous small scenes and by the activities of small figures. The vast landscape is dotted with chapels and tiny dwellings.

32188-lastjudg.jpg	The second half of the sixteenth century in Bruges was dominated by Pieter Pourbus, a talented master who attained a strictly Italianate classical perfection rare in the Low Countries. In another sense, however, Pourbus was the reincarnation of his famous predecessors, Memling and David. The serenity and innocence of his work could almost persuade the viewer that there had never been a transition to the Renaissance. Karel van Mander tells us (1604) that Pourbus admired these masters very much. Many of his religious works remain in Bruges churches, as a result of which they are less well known.The Last Judgment painted in 1551 for the Council Chamber of the `Liberty of Bruges' (an administrative district consisting of the countryside around Bruges, but not the town itself) is one of his earliest and most monumental pieces. It owes its inspiration to Michelangelo's fresco in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, completed ten years earlier, and is the first attempt in the Low Countries to pay homage to the work of the Italian master on a monumental scale.

26622-09_4se.jpg	The picture shows the Ignudo at the lower left corner of the Separation of Light from Darkness (above the prophet Jeremiah).The poses of the four ignudi in the ninth bay are very different from each other, without any attempt being made to obtain an effect of symmetry. Thus, the one above Jeremiah at the left, with a classical profile and a meditative attitude, contrasts sharply with the ungainly movement of the one the right, who laden with foliage and acorns, is throwing himself forward, his face in the shadow. On the opposite side, the two figures bend toward the centre, but with their torsos heads rotating in opposite directions with clearly distinct movements, splendidly rendered thanks to the artist's skilled use of perspective

00670-baptist.jpg	This is a celebrated picture. Although actually disfigured by bad restorations in old times which have changed the background and diminished the splendor and especially the interrelation of colors, there still remains the frank, original and lively conception of this youthful figure.The impressive image of the young Baptist, of an evocative power that in this case also one might call pre-Baroque, emerges from a dark grey background in which one glimpses the slightly pinkish rockface of a grotto. The athletic figure, the animal skin and the cloak are thrown into relief by a dramatic light that still illumines wonderful pictorial effects visible in the better preserved parts, such as the cross made of cane in the lower corner. These are the effects that will be taken up again by many of the Florentine painters of the 17th century

35719-view_haa.jpg	Of about the late 1660s are many firsthand views of the Dutch landscape in its various aspects by Ruisdael. The sea, the shore, the vast fertile plains now become important subjects side by side with the woods and waterfalls, and they are always seen under a majestic sky. In his panoramic views of Haarlem with its bleaching grounds, which continue into the seventies, the master's hand is felt in the strength and deceptive simplicity of the compositions. Bleaching fields were familiar sights in his time. After brewing, bleaching linen manufactured in Holland and unbleached cloth imported from England, Germany, and the Baltic countries was Haarlem's major industry. Jacob's 'Haarlempjes' - as they were called in his day - appeal to us because they offer what is now accepted as the most characteristic view of the Dutch countryside while achieving an unparalleled degree of openness and height. The one at Zurich, a summit of Jacob's achievement, is an exemplar of the type.Its sky, as the skies in most of them, takes up more than two thirds of the canvas, but the impression of height is increased here by the vertical format, and still more by the dominant part the towering, strongly modelled clouds play in the awe-inspiring aerial zone. The prospect of the plain is shown from an exceptionally distant and elevated point of view. As a result there is a reduction in both in scale and in overlappings of the watery dunes, woods, and tracts of land. The firm cohesion of the great cloudy sky gains in mass and significance from its relations to the diminutive forms. The eye can explore here - more than in most other 'Haarlempjes' - the vast expanse of the land richly differentiated by the gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow into the distance toward a horizon stretched taut as sinew

19243-stillif2.jpg	The pair of paintings, the Still-Life with Flowers and a Dog, and the Still-Life with a Puppy formed part of the interior decoration of Jean de Croy's palace in Madrid. This Flemish nobleman, Count of Soire and Captain of the Flemish Guard of Archers, was also the owner of Van der Hamen's Offering to Flora. The paintings, which were probably commissioned by De Croy (d. 1638), hung unframed on either side of the doorway of a room that led on to the picture gallery. Here, they probably served as illusionistic extensions of real space, perhaps by reproducing the actual floor of the room. The dog and its playful puppy may well have portrayed actual animals owned by the patron. The theme of the pictures is related to the culture of aristocratic hospitality, that was such a necessary part of the refined lifestyle of the occupants of the house. In one of the pictures, a wine cooler stands on the floor and the side tables covered with green velvet damask display sweetmeats and a glass ewer with aloja, an aromatic drink popular at the time, while the clock shows that it is just before five o'clock, an appropriate time for such treats.The major motifs in these pictures are two large gilt ormolu and glass vases with floral arrangements. These vessels represent a type of luxury decorative object that suited the status of Van der Hamen s patron, and the flowers they contain stand out for the copiousness and variety of their blooms. They doubtlessly evoke real arrangements of flowers that formed a part of the rich decor of Soire's house. However, these were not painted from life and are artificial images in representing blooms in such perfect condition and in bringing together flowers that bloom at different times of the year

The St Jerome and the Lion and the Funeral of St Jerome, dated 1502, still contain some views that recall the part of the city where the Scuola stood, especially the area around the church of San Giovanni al Tempio and the Hospital of Santa Caterina as they appear in the map of Venice drawn up by Jacopo de' Barbari in 1500.Set in the open square surrounded by carefully planned architectural constructions, the story of St Jerome and the Lion unfolds in several separate episodes, for the most part centering round the figure of the wild beast, tamed by the saint. The monks are shown running in all directions, their blue and white tunics flapping in the wind; the details of the palm trees, the Turks with their turbans and a few exotic animals are the only elements that suggest that the event is actually taking place in Bethlehem, where according to the Legenda Aurea, the Bishop of Split had retired to"

23765-madchild.jpg	"The half length figure of the Virgin, with the Child supported by her right arm, is shown within the three-dimensional representation of a window-frame. It was due to the influence of Sienese painting that this Byzantine type of picture found its way to the North. In the Burgundian (and French) painting this is the very first half figure representation of the Madonna and as such has remained unique for many years. This small picture (which is only as big as a Book of Hours) may have stood on the altar of a domestic chapel or on a prie-dieu in the corner of a room.The motif of the window-frame provides the reason why the Virgin is represented as a half length figure. In this way the Madonna comes close to the praying person, but, at the same time, the frame emphasizes the majesty of the Mother of God. (Because rulers generally appeared at a window to show themselves to the people, the window became a symbol of royalty.) The painter may have had in mind the medieval hymns in which the Virgin was praised as ""the Window of Heaven"" (fenestra coeli), as it was through her that the Lord endowed the world with genuine light.The Child's delicate body is also depicted from the waist upwards, emerging from Mary's wide and velvety soft cloak. It is not the primary purpose of the drapery to convey the structure of the underlying figure, for the drapery forms an independent element of the composition, which can be modelled as the artist wishes. (See, for example, the protruding form at the Madonna's right shoulder.) The arrangement whereby the folds of the mantle spread out radially from the Madonna's left wrist is most refined and so is the narrowing down of the blue area of the whole drapery at the bottom part of the picture.The two figures are almost fused together by love, and yet are surrounded by a melancholy mood, the austere premonition of the Passion. The Virgin is absorbed in her thoughts, the Child opens His big, round eyes and looks at the spectator. His forefinger may enjoin silence upon the approaching worshipper. We can see the same motif in Stefano da Verona's Madonna in the Rosary, whose style as well as that of Michelino da Besozzo's The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine were directly influenced by the painting which originated from the Malouel workshop"

32062-cremona1.jpg	Located on the inner fa�ade of the cathedral, this is the most impressive of the murals of the Passion of Christ that were the contribution of Pordenone to the large-scale decorative cycle painted by various artists in Cremona cathedral. The ample space offered by the Romanesque building allowed Pordenone to give free rein to his violent, dramatic, and highly-charged theatrical vein. The composition has the air of a painterly whirlwind and was much appreciated by the public.The Crucifixion by Pordenone dominate the nave; an elevated Golgotha towers over the portal of the entrance. Pordenone places the cross at an angle in the picture plane, which moves Christ to the right of centre, making the composition more dynamic. The movement of the riders beneath the crosses echoes the crosses above them. A circular configuration results, and Mary has fallen into a faint at its centre.In the lower zone of the wall next to the portal to the church Pordenone painted the Lamentation in 1522. Not until 1529 did the Lamentation receive its pendant, when Bernardino Gatti painted the Resurrection on the other side of the portal

11297-318delac.jpg	Torquato Tasso (1544-1595), Italian poet, one of the foremost writers and a tragic figure of the Renaissance. In 1565 he joined the court of Alfonso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, where he wrote the first version of his masterpiece, Jerusalem Delivered (Ital. Gerusalemme liberata), an epic of the exploits of Godfrey of Boulogne during the First Crusade. He was frustrated by conditions at court, where he felt unappreciated by his patrons and envied by his colleagues. Psychologically unstable, he developed a persecution complex that led to a fit of violence in 1579. He was imprisoned in a convent from which he escaped. In 1579 he returned to Ferrara, but was confined in a madhouse, where he remained until 1586.For Romantics like Delacroix, Tasso, shut up in his Ferrarese prison, was to be the epitome of the artist-hero who suffers for his art and beliefs

33239-mecklenb.jpg	Allan Ramsay was official painter to George III and Queen Charlotte from the date of the accession in 1760, although technically he only succeeded John Shackleton as Principal Painter in Ordinary in 1767. By this date, however, he had already painted the State Portraits for which he is justly famous. Indeed, the success of the State Portraits was such that he was required to paint numerous replicas for most of the rest of his life. Ramsay was born in Edinburgh and his artistic abilities were brought to the attention of George III, when still Prince of Wales, by the 3rd Earl of Bute who served as mentor to the future king. Ramsay's style was influenced by two visits to Italy, the first between 1736 and 1738 in Rome and Naples and the second between 1754 and 1757 in Rome, but the compositions of his State Portraits, and above all the soft pastel colours, bespeak the influence of French painters such as Quentin La Tour, Jean-Baptiste Perroneau and Jean-Marc Nattier. It is significant that in the first instance Ramsay was appointed Principal Painter in preference to Sir Joshua Reynolds. Ramsay, like Gainsborough, established a good rapport with the Royal Family. However, he gave up painting around 1770 and devoted the rest of his life to writing essays and pamphlets on political subjects, becoming a friend of Samuel Johnson, who praised him highly for his literary merits.Prince George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1748-85) was the younger brother of Queen Charlotte. The portrait was probably painted when the prince was in London between November 1768 and August 1769. He is shown wearing the uniform of an officer of Cuirassiers, a unit of the 4th Regiment of Austrian-Salzburg Dragoons or 'Serbellonis' of which he was later Colonel from 1778 to 1786. He attained the rank of Major-General in the Austrian army.The portrait, which was presumably painted for Queen Charlotte, is a late work by Ramsay characterised by looser brushwork combined with the gentle colouring associated with the artist. There is a certain firmness in the drawing which attests to Ramsay's skill as a draughtsman, a facility apparent in his numerous drawings (Edinburgh, National Gallery of Scotland). The pale transparent flesh tones were the result of applying grey-green strokes over a red underpainting, while in the background the landscape appears to be veiled in mist. It is a romantic portrait with a mood of quiet heroism. The evenness of the paint, the muted light, the silvery tone, the attention to detail, and the quite outstanding rendering of different textures create a feeling of calm that is in contrast with Prince George's love of soldiering. The head and shoulders have been painted on a separate piece of canvas that has been set into a larger piece, a practice much favoured by the artist

40862-04calvar.jpg	The immense growth and renewal of painting as an artistic medium that occurred in the Southern Netherlands from around 1425-30 meant that most existing altarpieces were gradually replaced. Examples of fourteenth- or even early fifteenth-century panel painting are thus extremely scarce. One such work, from around 1400, is the Crucifixion with Saint Catherine and Saint Barbara, also known as the 'Tanners' Crucifixion', because it probably once belonged to the Bruges tanners' guild. It is one of the very few well-preserved examples of local Flemish painting in the Gothic International Style, which conquered Europe with its courtly and artful grace, elegant curves and decorative linearism.Tightly knit groups of figures are arranged on either side of the Cross in matching curved formations. The Virgin and Saint John form the nucleus of the group on the left, while the centurion and high priest do the same on the right. The sky is an unreal, golden plane with decorative motifs in relief. The painting is a 'chest retable', so called because the lid folds up to reveal a blue painted surface showing a geometric, starry sky. It is often held up as an exemplar of Bruges painting before Van Eyck, even though it could equally well have been produced in Brabant

17060-paris10.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 370, JH 1208.The Caf� du Tambourin in Montmartre was a favourite place of Parisian artists. Van Gogh painted the portrait of the caf�'s owner, Agostina Segatori, who sat for van Gogh a few times. In fact the only nudes he ever painted in oil were of her. Agostina had modelled for Corot, too.In the present portrait we see her sitting at a table in the Tambourin that resembles the musical instrument that gave the caf� its name. The setting of this painting was plainly inspired by Degas's Absinthe Drinkers. But in taking his bearings from Degas, van Gogh was not so much out to record the hopeless solitude of one woman seeking solace in alcohol and a cigarette as to practice an Impressionist eye for a hazy, smoky atmosphere. Merging unclearly with the greenish background are a number of Japanese woodcuts on the wall paneling, doubtless from the collection of the van Gogh brothers

03866-149alle.jpg	The meaning of the representation of the painting is an unresolved question. According to the various interpretations the painting would be seen respectively as: (1) the pictorial representation of a French allegorical poem of the 14th century; (2) a Sacred Conversation; (3) a complex allegorical representation of God's four daughters (Mercy, Justice, Peace, Charity); (4) the vision of Paradise; (5) a meditation on incarnation.In the past the painting was for long attributed to Giorgione owing to the warm diffusion of the light, the subtle but total naturalism, and the air drenched with golden color. Nevertheless the scheme used by Bellini was still the traditional one, planned according to a rational and controlled construction of the whole composition, although signs of the imminent new landscapist vision of the 16th ventury can be discerned.The picture  is, however, justly one of the most famous of the master's paintings, inspired, in the already complete tonal unity of the colour, by a spirit of profound and visionary contemplation. From such works as this Giorgione takes his point of departure

15540-6innoce.jpg	"The Slaughter of the Innocents is on the third level of the left wall of the chapel, next to the Adoration of the Magi.Vasari described this scene as being the best painting in the entire cycle ""because it was executed with good judgment, ingenuity, and great skill"". In the fresco ""... we see the cruelty of those who at Herod's command kill the poor children without pity for their mothers... Many other emotions are also represented, so that no beholder can doubt the excellence of the master"".It is surprising that this horrific event is given an individual monumental scene in the cycle of the life of Mary, and that the normally very popular Annunciation scene is pushed to one side. But the Slaughter of the Innocents provided Ghirlandaio with an opportunity to present a dramatic composition showing a lively crowd scene scenes he had studied in classical models. It was not without reason that he placed a Roman triumphal arch covered with relief of classical battle scenes towering up behind the dramatic events. Once again the background of the picture acts as a backdrop, for the figures are bunched together on a densely packed front stage and are not integrated into architecture. The Slaughter of the Innocents takes place amid a violent swirl of movements and gestures. There is a dramatic confusion of people's and horses' bodies, which fall upon each other all around. Ghirlandaio depicts the classical model for the scene at the top on the arch.The liveliest composition in the artist's entire range of works, this large crowd scene is reminiscent of classical battle reliefs. The mothers of Bethlehem are in a wild panic, trying to save their children from the killers' swords, which are flashing through the air. On the ground lie the mutilated bodies of the slaughtered innocents in pools of blood.In the foreground on the right a desperately screaming mother, her red garment billowing in frantic folds, is tearing at the hair of one of the killers from behind. Pure horror is written on her face. The soldier, dressed in classical armor that has a blue leather body piece shaped to indicated the ribs, is bending right over backwards. The foreground of the picture is characterized by falling horses, bloody limbs and heads, streaming hair and drawn swords. On the far right the fleeing mothers are bunched together, but they will not succeed in escaping Herod's order that all the children of the same age as Christ should be put to the sword"

23249-jupiter.jpg	Philemon and Baucis was an old couple who, according to Ovid (Met. 8:621-96) once gave hospitality in their humble cottage to two travellers who had been turned away from other, richer houses. During supper, to the hosts' astonishment, the wine bowl miraculously replenished itself; their only goose, which they would have killed for the occasion, flew to the visitors for refuge. Jupiter and Mercury, for it was they, then revealed themselves to Philemon and Baucis, and took them up to the mountainside where they observed that the whole country was covered with flood waters, except for the cottage which had been changed into a temple. Granted a wish by Jupiter, the old man and woman chose to be priests of the temple. At their death they were changed into an oak and a lime tree.
