38707-bagpipe.jpg	Hendrick ter Brugghen was a highly original painter. He was probably born in Utrecht, where he was a pupil of the Mannerist history painter, Abraham Bloemaert. Having learnt the basic skills of his craft in Bloemaert's workshop, he set off for an extended stay in Italy, a practice which was quite usual among Dutch artists - and especially those from the Catholic city of Utrecht - in the early seventeenth century. Ter Brugghen seems to have been based in Rome. It was a time of hectic activity and experiment: the young painter from Utrecht studied the work of the Carracci, Domenichino and Guido Reni, but the artist who was to have the most profound effect on him was Caravaggio, who fled from Rome after killing a man in 1606 and died four years later at Porto Ercole.Caravaggio's powerful, even shocking, naturalism and his dramatic use of bold highlights and deep shadows particularly excited the young ter Brugghen. After Caravaggio's death; his revolutionary style was adopted and developed in the direction of more decorative effects by a group of Italian followers, among them Orazio Gentileschi and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Ter Brugghen was arguably the leading member of a group of young Utrecht artists who were profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio and his Italian followers: they have been collectively christened the Dutch Caravaggisti. Gerrit van Honthorst and Dirk van Baburen followed the same route as ter Brugghen and had the same transforming experience. Together they fashioned a new type of history painting which was to change the course of large-scale narrative painting in the north and, in particular, affect Rembrandt's treatment of biblical subjects.Ter Brugghen was the first of the Dutch Garavaggisti to return home and bring the gospel of Caravaggism to the Netherlands: he was back in Utrecht by 1615. He died young, in 1629, but in the years after his return from Italy he developed a striking and original manner of painting and range of subject-matter. Following the example of Gentileschi and Manfredi, he painted half-length figures of drinkers and musicians, of which the Bagpipe Player is an outstanding example. He also painted more ambitious multifigured secular subjects, such as The Concert (London, National Gallery) of about 1626, based on Italian Caravaggesque prototypes. In The Concert he brings to an existing format of half-length figures gathered together around a flickering candle, a striking fluency in modelling the soft edges of his forms and a remarkable subtlety of palette - which includes light blues, lemon, purple and cerise

07428-salvo.jpg	Jan van de Cappelle is today considered to be one of the greatest of Dutch marine painters. According to a contemporary he was self-taught but he clearly took as his models Simon de Vlieger and Jan Porcellis, works by both of whom were in his own large collection of paintings and drawings. Porcellis had been the first marine painter to break with the dominant Mannerist style of Hendrick Vroom, in whose paintings elaborately described two-dimensional ships were tossed on the top of bright green waves. Porcellis adopted a very restricted grey, black and white palette to paint realistic scenes of storms at sea, a style which De Vlieger developed in the direction of greater naturalism by extending the range of the palette and the ambition of the compositions.Van de Cappelle further extended the possibilities of this naturalistic style. He employs a low horizon, as Ruisdael and Koninck did in their landscapes, and consequently the sky assumes almost as great a significance as the scene beneath it. Although carefully composed, van de Cappelle's paintings seem to give the impression of a scene glimpsed suddenly by cutting off parts of ships on one or both sides of the composition - as here on the left. In this painting of 1650 the focus of the scene is the States' yacht in the centre with the Dutch flag and the coat of arms on her stern: she is firing a salute and a trumpeter on board is sounding. In the right foreground is a row-barge also flying the Dutch flag and with a distinguished man in the stern with the Dutch colours in his hat. It is this visitor who has presumably just left the yacht. Van de Cappelle was especially skilful at representing the cluster of masts and sails, and the reflections of the ships in the unruffled surface of the water.This painting depicts a real event, probably the arrival of Friderick Henry and William II of Orania.Van de Cappelle, who lived and worked in Amsterdam, produced relatively few paintings. His family owned a dye-works, from which he derived his considerable wealth, and he amassed a fascinating collection of works by other artists

11267-201delac.jpg	This painting, painted at Beffes for General Coetlosquet, was one of the splendid collection of works which Delacroix sent to the Salon of 1827, and which included the Death of Sardanapalus as well as others from among his finest pictures. On 28 September 1827, Delacroix wrote to his friend Soulier: 'I have finished the General's animal picture, and I have dug up a rococo frame for it, which I have had regilded and which will do for it splendidly. It has already dazzled people at a gathering of amateurs, and I think it would be amusing to see it in the Salon.'Of all Delacroix's paintings, the Still-Life with Lobster reveals most clearly the impression made on the young artist by English painting. The background with its red-coated huntsmen is reminiscent of landscapes by Constable; the dead game in the foreground, and the incongruous lobster, rival the finest details in the works of Jan Fyt.Delacroix painted this picture when he returned from England; even before then, he was in close touch with English painters in Paris - Fielding and Bonington amongst others. But it was at the Salon of 1824 that he discovered the revolution which Constable had brought about in English painting, when he saw the three landscapes which the latter was exhibiting there. He hastily repainted the background of the Massacre of Scio along much the same lines; when the state bought the picture from him for 6,000 francs (a considerable sum in those days) he lost no time in spending the money on a trip to England. This opened up a new world to him: the Parthenon marbles, the Gothic style, the paintings of Lawrence and Etty, the horses (his host was the horsedealer Elmore), sailing in a yacht - a sport he was able to indulge in with an aristocratic friend of Elmore's - and the plays of Shakespeare. English painting had attracted a whole colony of French artists to London; among them Eug�ne Isabey, Eug�ne Lami, and Henri Monnier. Delacroix also renewed contact with Bonington, and worked in company with him. He was in London when he heard of the heroic death of Lord Byron, to whom he pays tribute in his Journal

08224-01lastju.jpg	The picture shows the middle register of the fragmentary Last Judgment.The fresco decoration of the interior fa�ade and the walls of the nave in Santa Cecilia in Trastevere was executed c. 1300 by Pietro Cavallini. The frescoes of the nave were largely destroyed when Cardinal Francesco Acquaviva had the interior redesigned in 1724-25. Not until 1900, during restoration work in the church, did large sections of the old fresco decoration come to light again. The middle register of a depiction of the Last Judgment on the west wall of the basilica, fragments of the fresco of the Annunciation on the north wall, and two scenes from the story of Jacob on the south wall were uncovered.Of the paintings in Santa Cecilia, the most important is the fragment of the Last Judgment that extends the entire width of the west wall. It depicts Christ in judgment in the centre, seated on a wooden throne that is decorated with pearls and precious stones and was at one time partially gilded. He is surrounded by a red mandorla. The enthroned Christ is facing the viewer, but he is looking to the side. His right hand is extended toward the blessed; the left hand, which has not survived, would have been raised and presumably outstretched toward the damned in a dismissive gesture. The wounds on his feet, hands, and chest are displayed.Angels, whose bright, colourful feathers stand out against the dark blue ground of the fresco, frame the mandorla. To Christ's right the Virgin stands on a rectangular wooden pedestal; she is dressed in a blue garment under a violet cloak and is turned toward Christ in prayer. Corresponding to her on the other side is John the Baptist, who  is wearing a a violet garment under a brown, fur-lined cloak. Behind the Virgin and John are the apostles, each sitting ion a wooden throne; they can be recognized by the names inscribed on the footrests of their thrones and by their attributes

19575-allegory.jpg	The influence of Italian art on Van Hemessen indicates that he visited Italy. It is assumed that he was in northern Italy around 1530 where he probably saw paintings by Moretto da Brescia, Romanino and Savoldo, from whom he borrowed his figure types. It is also likely that he visited Fontainebleau in the 1540s when Rosso Fiorentino and Primaticcio were working on the decoration of the King Fran�ois I's castle.This pastoral-like painting has an odd subject: a woman seated in a landscape sprinkles milk from her breast over the lira da braccio of the man opposite her; in the background is a flock of sheep, with a shepherd writing or drawing on the ground with his staff. The picture has been interpreted in several ways, among others as the musician's inspiration, as poetry and the poet, as an allegorical wedding portrait and as an allegory of marital harmony

28782-madonna3.jpg	This is an unusual depiction of the Virgin and Child by Morales, particularly so in its inclusion of the young St John the Baptist in the background. St. John's presence adds a narrative element to a scene that, for the most part, Morales almost always confines to a simple interaction between mother and child. Here however, creeping into view from behind, we see St John making direct eye contact with us, cheekily imploring us to remain quiet for fear of awakening his young cousin who sleeps cradled against his mother's bosom. His inclusion turns the painting from one of, and for, mere devotion into something familial; it adds a sense of domesticity and informality to an otherwise purely devotional depiction of the Virgin and Child

03309-predell6.jpg	In 1485 Domenico Ghirlandaio received the commission for the Adoration of the Magi for the main altar in the church of the Spedale degli Innocenti. The prior of the church, Tesori, also commissioned the predella with stories of the Virgin and the great cornice of the altarpiece. The latter had been executed by the carpenter Francesco Bartolo on designs by Giuliano da Sangallo, while the scenes of the predella are the work of one of Ghirlandaio's pupils, Bartolomeo di Giovanni; this is confirmed by the records and the workmanship of the fine, slender figures which are characteristic of him.The predella, with the Martyrdom of St John the Evangelist, the Annunciation, the Marriage of the Virgin, the Deposition, the Presentation in the Temple, the Baptism of Christ, the Consecration of the Church of the Innocenti, had been dismembered at the time of the restoration of the great altar (1615). In the 19th century the seven panels were in the Sala delle Adunanze. Later they were reunited with the painting, which was now devoid of Sangallo's fine cornice that was destroyed in the restoration of 1786.The picture shows one of the seven predella paintings

27045-coffeeho.jpg	The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).Under the sons of Filippo II Colonna (1663-1714) more additions were made to the palace. A new wing was erected between 1730-33 by Nicola Michetti. Of this wing only the corner pavilion has survived unchanged, and in it is one of the loveliest interiors from the Roman Rococo. The room was also designed by Michetti. The square space, which is referred to as the Coffeehouse and was in fact used as a public caf� up to the 1930s, fits the type of the small pleasure house that became fashionable in the eighteenth century

15480-3smarco.jpg	The last surviving version of Ghirlandaio's Last Supper is in the refectory of the hostel of the San Marco convent.It is pleasing to observe that chronicler's narration of his city and the rich bourgeois inhabitants who enlivened it in the middle of the 15th century. It is typical of the work of Ghirlandaio, who certainly sketched out the drawing and, at times, participated directly in its execution. Rendered without resorting to dramatic force, it reveals a serenity and great faithfulness to life. Note the impassive Judas, seated in front of Jesus and almost conversing with him. The supper takes place at a large table with a bright tablecloth, embroidered at the edges. Nothing about it is casual; the crockery, the decanters, the knives, the bread and the cherries, are carefully arranged in front of every guest.With customary ease, Ghirlandaio fills the lunettes with large trees and birds in flight against a bright sky whose light is reflected onto the right-hand wall where an open window frames a perching peacock. The rest is in shadow. Two flower-displays complete the frame which encloses the space. A cat, waiting patiently for a hoped-for scrap of meat, lends a touch of intimacy and domesticity that is rarely lacking in Ghirlandaio

25870-allegory.jpg	The Sienese painter Bernardino Mei, author of this masterpiece, was a student of Rutilio Manetti. He moved to Rome permanently in 1657, and there became fascinated with the painting of Preti, Sacchi, Maratta, and Mola, as well as with the sculpture of Bernini. The result for Mei's own work was an important synthesis of classicism and Baroque elements.This painting has connected with a seventeenth-century documentary reference to a picture of Fortune Subdued by Virtue. The painting treats the stoic theme of the disdain of wealth, a virtue that places the philosopher above the vicissitudes of Fortune. The picture was originally part of a series of large canvases painted by Mei between 1660 and 1670 and now dispersed. Commissioned by Cardinal Flavio Chigi, the series once decorated the grand salon of the Palazzo Chigi. In this important painting, with its grandiose composition and surface rhythm of monumental figures (derived in part from classical statuary), traces of Mei's maturing artistic experiences in these years can be recognized. The artist has transformed the naturalism of his teacher Rutilio Manetti, creating forms that are radiantly illuminated by a cold, glossily rendered light. The figure of the philosopher Cratetes, wrapped in shadow, is a perfect example of Mei's fusion of the naturalism of Preti and the classicism of Maratta

33543-64portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 360.Agatha Bas (1611-1658) was a member of one of Amsterdam's leading families, the middle daughter of Dirk Jacobsz. Bas, a director of the Dutch East India Company who had served as burgomaster of the city on several occasions. She married Nicholas van Bambeeck (1596-1661), a successful cloth merchant who was an immigrant from Flanders, when she was twenty-seven. Rembrandt had probably known Bambeeck for some time before he painted both his portrait and the companion portrait of Agatha. In 1631 Bambeeck was living in the Sintanthonisbreestraat, where Rembrandt was also staying in the house of the art dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh; both Rembrandt and Bambeeck invested in Uylenburgh's business in 1640.The pair of canvasses depicting Bambeeck and his wife are superb examples of the accomplished and imposing portraits bathed in soft light which Rembrandt was painting in the years around 1640. He placed both husband and wife in illusionistic painted frames, an effect heightened by the cloak and glove seemingly hanging over the edge of the frame in Nicholas's portrait, and the fingers of Agatha's left hand which appear to project beyond the frame here. Unfortunately both paintings have been cut down at the top and sides, removing part of the painted frames and so weakening the trompe l'oeil effect. Originally the portraits would have been shown in arched ebony frames, echoing their painted counterparts, and so further merging painted appearances and reality. The paintings hung together until they were sold in London in 1814. Agatha Bas was bought in 1819 by Lord Yarmouth acting for the Prince Regent and so entered the Royal Collection. Nicolaes van Bambeeck was purchased by the Mus�e Royale des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, in 1841

42608-23conce.jpg	Signature: Not signed.Provenance: The first reference to this painting can be found in the sale Johannes Lodewijk Strantwijk, Amsterdam, 1780, where it is already dubbed a work by Jan van der Meer, de Delfze. Subsequently, sale Monsieur van Leyden, Paris, 1804; sale London (Foster), 1835; sale Admiral Lysaght et al., London (Christie), 1860; sale Demidoff, Paris, 1869; sale (heirs) Thor�-B�rger, Paris, 1892; there acquired by Mrs. Isabella Stewart Gardner. The painting was stolen in 1991 and has not been recovered since.This painting superficially resembles A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman (Buckingham Palace, London) in that it features the making of music in a domestic environment. But there the likeness stops. The Lady at the Virginals was very rigidly constructed, pruned to the point of abstraction, and allowing the viewer only a glance from afar upon the principal scene. In the Concert, we are again part of the happening, although separated from it by the table covered with the familiar red Oriental rug and the bass viol on the floor.However, the music-making trio in a compact group presents itself sufficiently close to our vision so that the viewer shares in the earnest concentration of the figures. This slightly removed part of the painting is particularly rich in details, almost pictures within the picture. On the far wall to the right, we find Baburen's Procuress, which was part of Vermeer's stock as an art dealer. To the left is a landscape in the style of Jacob van Ruisdael. The two are linked by the landscape on the raised cover of the clavecin done in the then-fashionable style of the Italianizing Dutch landscape painters such as Jan Both.For Vermeer, such a crowding of decorative elements is rather unusual, and has therefore encouraged critics to attempt various interpretations of the meaning of the scene. They range from calling it a brothel (de Mirimonde) to a domestic scene with the lady to the right being the personification of temperance (I. L. Moreno)! In any case, the amateur seeking purely aesthetic pleasure will find delight in the perfection of the composition, the delicate execution of the figures, as well as of the paraphernalia, and the masterly use of diffused light enveloping the actors. In this work, Vermeer stands greatly above his contemporaries de Hooch, Jan Steen, Metsu, and many others, in harmony, grandeur, and artistic skill

00066-ark1.jpg	Luigi Ademollo, an Italian painter, draftsman, and engraver, was the uncle of the painter Carlo Ademollo (1825-1911). He decorated this room with biblical scenes inspired by the history surrounding the Holy Ark of the Jewish people.

44104-6isabell.jpg	"Some major altarpieces for noble clients by Rogier van der Weyden are now lost. One, executed around 1445-1450, was a picture of the Madonna being venerated by the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy and their son. The Duchess, Isabella of Portugal, gave it to a monastery in Batalha in Portugal, where her father was buried. The composition survives only in a cursory sketch of the early 19th century. A rather better impression of the donor's likeness is conveyed by a portrait of Isabella of Portugal by an anonymous artist, but again, this is only a copy from Rogier's original. The original was based on either the same portrait drawing as was used for the donor's picture on the Batalha altarpiece, or from her likeness in the altarpiece itself. Although the copy displays some weaknesses, Rogier's concept of portraiture is still perceptible in the tender, slightly mocking expression on the duchess's aristocratic face, and in her long fingers. The detailed reproduction of her expensive clothing reflects the ducal splendour that must have been conveyed by the Batalha altarpiece.The original by Rogier van der Weyden of which this is a copy must have been painted before 1451, the date of an anonymous altarpiece panel now in New York; the depiction of the female donor in the altarpiece was strongly influenced by the portrait of Isabella of Portugal, the characteristic necklace in particular matching in both arts.

24132-2eccehom.jpg	Between 1490 and 1506, the year he died, Mantegna painted several devotional paintings in which the main figures are represented as reliefs standing out against a mostly dark background. Inspired by reliefs on classical tombs, these figures are shown partially hidden behind stone balustrades or a frame. The most impressive of the paintings from Mantegna's final years include the Ecce Homo in the Mus�e Jacquemart-Andr�, Paris, and the St Sebastian in the Ca' d'Oro, Venice.In the Ecce Homo, the portrayal of the flagellated Christ combines the timeless devotional image with a historic reference to a real event. The figure of Christ is displayed covered in weals from the flagellation, and with the crown of thorns on his head. Of the two men holding him, one is wearing a paper headband with an inscription in pseudo-Hebrew. Two other figures are barely visible in the background. The unfolded sheet of paper in the top corner bears the proclamation of the crucifixion

The Apollo and Daphne, left unfinished at his death, sums up all the strange features of Poussin's last phase: the wildness and grandeur of inanimate nature, the impassive calm of the human actors, here more than ever like wax images, and the other-wordly atmosphere in which they live. These are no longer the gods and goddesses of Ovid, subject to the passions of the flesh. They are symbols created by the mind of the artist, existing in a world of pure intellect

07465-07fortun.jpg	The youth abandons his reserve, leans over towards the gypsy-woman and looks into her smiling face, as if he idolized her, and as if the woman was enticing a very willing man. We cannot be absolutely sure this picture is an original Caravaggio. Its authenticity has recently been based on two arguments. The genre-scene has been painted over a praying female saint, perhaps the Virgin Mary, and the most likely painter is the Cavaliere d'Arpino. The painting also carries the same indication of provenance from Cardinal del Monte's Collection as the Cardsharps. The same subject-matter recurs in Narcissus. In the case of this not-undisputed picture, the smooth way in which the paint is applied suggests a Caravaggesque artist of some note

06203-cosimo.jpg	Cosimo I dei Medici (Florence 1519-1574) son of Maria Salviati and Giovanni dei Medici, called Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, was duke of Florence since 1537 and first Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1569 to his death. In this portrait he is about 25 years old, wearing his glittering armour, that points out his political ability and his power as a ruler-commander who would have enlarged and fortified the Florentine State. This painting, slightly wooden and less polished than all the other portraits with which Bronzino consigned the members of the Medici family to posterity, must now be regarded as the original of a long series of replicas. (There are less inspired replicas in the Galleria Palatina, the gallery of Kassel and the Metropolitan Museum in New York.) Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the painting is the skilful rendering of the armour, the flashing reflections of the metal and the hand resting languidly on the helmet. It is very beautiful in the firm drawing and the hard polish of the planes to an almost metaphysical effect.

15023-marque06.jpg	The sitter of this painting was Tohotaua, the wife of the witch-doctor at Hiva Oa. The figure is strangely isolated in space, staring impassively forward with the static quality and crisply delineated shadows that suggest a photographic source. Indeed, Gauguin used a photo when working on the portrait.The model for this work reappeared in Contes Barbares, but the painting itself was based on a photograph of the woman taken in 1901 and found in Gauguin's effects after his death in Hiva Oa. Although the pose in the painted version is broadly similar to that in the photograph, Gauguin has made a number of important changes. Instead of coolly appraising the viewer as in the photograph, the woman here gazes into space. The pareo with which Tohotaua covered her breasts in the photograph, has been changed and the image becomes much more overtly erotic. The position of the fan has been moved slightly, so that it covers her right breast in a provocative fashion. In making these changes, Gauguin has constructed an image of an archetypal Polynesian woman, passive and sexually available

42209-0108vela.jpg	"In this early work, Vel�zquez refers to the gospel according to St Luke, which tells of a visit by Christ to the house of Mary and Martha. While Mary sat at his feet to listen to his words, Martha busied herself with work in the kitchen; eventually, she came to him and said: ""Lord, dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me."" To which Christ replied, ""Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things; but one thing is needful: and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."" (St Luke 10:40-42).The composition of the painting, with a kitchen scene in the tradition of the ""bodegones"" taking up the foreground, while the scene involving Christ is presented as a view or a mirror image, is clearly influenced by the art of the Netherlands. Even the plump, ruddy-cheeked figure of Martha and the still-life arrangement of fish, garlic, eggs and paprika, recall examples of Northern European art. Moreover, this picture is charged with a strange sense of tension and restlessness. The events reflected in the mirror, bathed in a mild light and exuding an atmosphere peace and calm, are contrasted with the foreground image of loud and busy work. Through highlighting and formal diversity, the artist sets a scene that is clearly dissatisfactory to Martha. She is not concentrating on her work, but gazes full of yearning, on the verge of tears, and slightly angrily, as though she already realized that Mary had chosen the better part"

33979-marymagd.jpg	Executed by Reni for the Cardinal Antonio Santacroce, this painting of the Magdalene was presented by Valerio Santacroce to Cardinal Antonio Barberini in December 1641, after the death of its original owner. Its completion can be securely dated to 1633, the year in which Vizzani published an encomiastic description of the picture.The image of the penitent Mary Magdalene enjoyed great popularity between the late sixteenth century and the first decades of the seventeenth century. Cardinal Baronius, in his hard-hitting polemics against Protestantism, employed the subject (along with that of the penitent St Peter) to emphasize the necessity and validity of penitence, a sacrament discarded by the reformers. The penitent Magdalene was something of a iconographic specialty for Reni, who executed various versions to please a public that prized them and continually requested them. The Barberini collection included an other Reni Magdalene with a Skull, similar to the present work but for the three-quarter length of the figure. Executed during the artist's brief sojourn in Rome in 1627, the second Barberini Magdalene has been identified in a private collection.A splendid example of the mature style of Reni, the National Gallery's painting is characterized by a profound classicism in the monumental and noble figure of the saint. The refined chromatic range, lit by a cold and silvery light, is also typical of Reni's art in the 1630's. The Penitent Magdalene is chronologically connected, though problematically, to a third Barberini Magdalene attributed to Vouet or one of his close followers: datable to 1626-27, the composition of the latter painting is very close to that of the Reni

19881-2erasmus.jpg	Erasmus and Holbein were close friends who had become acquainted when both lived in Basel. It was there in 1523 that Holbein painted two important portraits of his friend, one of which is in the Mus�e du Louvre, Paris and the other is on loan from the Longford Castle  collection in the National Gallery, London. The latter portrait served as the model for subsequent images, which were produced in three different versions: a half-length view of Erasmus holding o book, either open or closed; a half-length figure with overlapping hands, exemplified by the present painting; and a bust-length roundel of which the primary example is in the Kunstmuseum, Basel.The second type, the most popular, inspired further copies, namely those from the workshop of Lucas Cranach the Elder after 1535 and others by Georg Pencz dated 1536-37

41295-11middle.jpg	"We know mainly from literature that in Hungary in the mid-seventeenth century family portraits we no longer confined to aristocratic homes but were also to be seen in the houses of the bourgeoisie. Of that period, however, little has survived and these remain include few portraits of the middle classes. Most of then are half-length portraits with neutral backgrounds, whereas in portraits of the aristocracy dignity and rank were indicated by the richness of the clothing and the elegant setting. In the picture illustrated here the artist has captured the individuality of the sitter, her rather hard features, the details and texture of her clothing - all testifying to the fact that aristocratic and bourgeois portraits were occasionally of equal quality. Indeed this portrait is the work of a talented painter who must surely have been a member of the painters' guild in L�cse.The painting also provides interesting information for students of the history of Hungarian national costume, for it shows a combination of European court fashion and the typically Hungarian style only the beginning to develop. The lace-hemmed rich colarette known as ""the fraise"", which came to Hungary from the Spanish court, was adopted both by the aristocracy and the middle classes. It is matched in an interesting way by a pearl-embroidered reticulated bonnet closed in front like a ""p�rta"" (a headdress worn by Hungarian girls), a bodice richly embroidered with gold thread an fastened with hooks, and a pleated green silk apron trimmed with gold lace. These profusely decorated pieces worn by Hungarian women provided the unique local character which foreign travellers visiting Hungary had so often admired. The subject of this portrait is seen holding a shawl embroidered with Turkish motifs, while round her waist is a superb enamel-painted, gilded belt"

22723-8madonn.jpg	This extremely well-known and even popular work has always been considered as one of the highest and most lyrical expressions of Lippi's art. It is certainly a late composition, a distinct foretaste of themes that would be developed by Botticelli, Pollaiolo and Leonardo: the tension and incisiveness of the line, the typology of the faces and the tender melancholy expressed by the persons portrayed. It has been said that this work represents not a mother with her child, but rather abstract figures absorbed in a vaster contemplation of private thoughts and feelings.The element of design is so greatly emphasised in this painting that it seems almost the artist's only means of expression. His colour creates a soft light, and the play of light and shade, plus the transparency of the veils, creates the illusion of movement rather than of substance. In the context of this soft light, the suggestion of modelling in the face of the Madonna seems hardly more than a tremor.The delicate profile of the Virgin Mary, seated by the window, is outlined clearly against the rocky landscape, while two angels hold up the Christ Child, who reaches toward his praying mother. The angel in the foreground turns with an odd smile toward the spectator

08694-12self_p.jpg	Failing eyesight and poor health in his last years led Chardin to change his medium to pastel, but he continued to work and exhibit. He first exhibited pastel heads in 1771, and for the rest of his life he continued to produce similar heads, several of which are lost or unidentified. What he could achieve in the medium, however, remains memorably, movingly clear in the well-known portrait of himself. It owes little to La Tour or Perronneau. Instead, pastel is made to conform to Chardin's ever-recognizable technique: hatching, inlaying of colour, tonal sensitivity without illusionistic tricks, marvellous firmness of forms - utter unsentimentality of vision - such are the qualities of the pastel portraits. Chardin had indeed always possessed them, and was triumphantly in his late seventies to prove that he retained them

15446-3brozzi1.jpg	About 1473, Ghirlandaio painted the fresco Madonna and Child with Saints Sebastian and Julian in the church of Sant'Andrea a Brozzi in San Donnino near Florence. It is still disputed whether Ghirlandaio carried out this work, which is in a regrettably poor state of preservation, before or after his work in San Gimignano in about 1475. It is clear that in this Madonna and Child he does not appear to have found his own style yet.When compared to Ghirlandaio's later versions of this theme, the composition appears to have been constructed rather summarily. The figures seem simply to have been lined up, as if placed on pedestals in niches, a feature that brings to mind the apse fresco in Cercina. In Sant'Andrea a Brozzi, however, the architecture - with the exception of the seashell-shaped niche above the throne and the framing pilasters - has been minimized in favour of a landscape. The saints are no longer standing in niches, but posing on a terrace high above a river. The strictly arranged figures do not overlap in any way and are standing in front of a poorly developed space. In his later use of such themes, Ghirlandaio would attempt to fill every empty space in the picture.The type of Madonna depicted and the form of the standing Christ Child are clearly influenced by Verrocchio, and it is likely that Ghirlandaio spent some time working in his workshop.The high forehead, sharp chin and narrow lips of Mary, and the upright contrapposto pose of her sturdy child are the features most clearly reminiscent of figures by Verrocchio. The Christ Child, shown naked, is seen from a frontal view standing on a small cushion lying on his mother's right thigh. This motif also was borrowed from Verrocchio and is used by Ghirlandaio on a further occasion in about 1479, on the altarpiece in Lucca, where he makes only slight changes to the child's stance. In both works, the figure of Mary with the high waistline belongs to the same type. Her garment, which has been totally destroyed above the knees in the fresco, can be reconstructed using the one shown in the later panel painting.Because of the fresco's poor state of preservation, there is little that can be said about the effect of the colours and modelling of the garments. The artistic qualities of this work have been largely destroyed, though this is not a reason for dismissing the fresco too readily.The two saints on either side of the throne are wearing fashionable clothing and posing rather affectedly. Both figures are derived from models in Castagno's Assumption of the Virgin dating from about 1450 and now in the Berlin Gem&#228;ldegalerie. This type of young man will frequently appear in Ghirlandaio's later works. Saint Sebastian on the left is turning to the Christ Child with an affectedly elegant gesture, and Saint Julian is holding out his sword. As he does so, he casually places his left hand on his hip. The same posture is rather amusing when seen in the Lucca Christ Child, as it is so unusual for a small child. The relationship of the motifs in the panel painting in Lucca and the fresco in Sant'Andrea can also be seen in the posture of the gray figure of Saint Paul, who is holding his sword in the same manner as Saint Julian. The Saint Sebastian in the panel painting has a similarly angelic face to the one in the fresco. In addition, both figures are holding arrows, the symbols of their martyrdom, with their fingertips

Collection D. Stchoukine, Moscow. Art gallery Wachtler, Berlin, as by Eglon van der Neer, with a false signature of C. Netscher. Bought from this gallery by A. Bredius. On loan to the Mauritshuis, The Hague (1899-1923). On loan to Boymans Museum, Rotterdam (1923-28). Art gallery F. Kleinberger, Paris. Collection Colonel M. Friedsam, New York. Bequeathed by the latter to the museum in 1931.An unusually large canvas for Vermeer, this is one of the two known paintings of his that have explicitly allegorical content. Vermeer had converted to Catholicism at the time of his marriage, and this work may have been commissioned by a Catholic institution.The subject matter for this allegory obviously did not suit Vermeer's taste. In the Art of Painting (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), he produced, in spite of the intrusion of iconographic material, a composition that conveyed a psychological approach joined to artistic execution. Even so, it was not really as successful as other works that imply thoughtfulness or meditation.The Allegory of Faith is fraught with details that evidently were prescribed by the spiritual fathers (probably the Jesuits, although the first known owner of the painting was a Protestant) of the composition, but that did not fit into an artistic image with which Vermeer could cope.Hence, we have here an exercise in classicism, of abstract concepts, which led to a mediocre result. The artist's creativity had, in any case, declined by then into a brittle style with no more inner warmth or ability to communicate.Thus, we are in the presence of a rather dry amalgamate, drawn in the main from Cesare Ripa's book Iconologia, to which a large Crucifixion by Jacob Jordaens on the back wall is added as a backdrop. Hence, this allegorical representation of the ""New Testament"" can have served as a didactic introduction to some aspects of the Catholic faith"

41144-virgin_c.jpg	The figure is cut in half, yet its sweeping Gothic lines are evident. The Virgin, surrounded by angels and wearing a gorgeous crown glittering with pearls and gems impersonates a remarkable type, namely the Madonna of the writing Christ Child. In her right she holds an inkhorn, a penholder is hanging from her wrist by a thin red cord; with an engaging gesture the Child catches hold of his mother's robe while obviously striving to get hold of the inkstand. In his other hand the Child holds a band covered with an illegible text; similar representations usually contain words which become Christ the teacher. Therefore the motive is a product of the endeavour manifested in various ways towards the close of the Middle Ages to associate the attributes of the adult Christ with the Infant Jesus.The colouring is simple, but the garments are sumptuous as befits the queen of heaven and her retinue of angels, though the glitter of gold is seen only on their Lady. The angel plucking the strings of his lute with a lightly bent feather is wearing a cloak with an elaborate ornamental pattern obviously derived from garments seen on the most stylishly apparelled notabilities, while the silky locks of all the figures falling in rich curls bear evidence of the high standards of hair-dressing in that age

43998-3bladel.jpg	"The scenes in the side panels depict the advent of the Son of God on earth being announced in miraculous visions to the Roman emperor Octavian (Augustus) and to the three Magi. The Christ Child receives the homage of both East and West, that is to say the whole world as displayed in the panorama of the open triptych: the West is symbolized by the Roman empire - which was regarded as the direct predecessor of the medieval Holy Roman Empire - the East by the Magi, and between them stands the Holy Land with Bethlehem, to the medieval mind the centre and navel of the world.The three pictures in the triptych are united not so much by their background setting as by the figures. These are all on the same scale, and are linked to create a compositional line running through the three panels: arranged on both wings in a semi-circle turning in, and on the central panel in a semi-circle turning out, they curve rhythmically in an undulating line - a good example of Rogier's ""sense of rhythm."" The panels are also linked by the skillful distribution of colour, with the red robe of the oldest king on the right, for instance, echoing the red garments of St. Joseph on the central panel, while the red-patterned gold brocade worn by the central king is matched by Octavian's robe on the opposite wing. These mirror-image correspondences are slightly shifted toward the central axis, and there are many other interrelating colour notes. However, the colour also has other meanings. On the wings, where it is distributed in smaller areas over the surface of the picture and is thus more varied, it illustrates the secular magnificence of earthly rulers, while on the central panel the symphony of red, white and black makes a nobler and sterner effect. Symbolically, white stands for Mary's virginity, while the black worn by the donor was the fashionable colour of the upper classes of the time. The colour composition of the altarpiece as a whole, constantly balancing its slight asymmetries, is well calculated, although ultimately the impression is of rather too regular a kind of diversity, without deep meaning or resonance"

07945-quovadis.jpg	"This tale from the life of St Peter is recorded in the collection of legends written down by Jacobus a Voragine in the 13th century. It tells how the apostle, having triumphed over Simon Magus, was persuaded by the Christians of Rome to leave town. Jacobus a Voragine relates how Peter encountered Christ on the Appian way and asked ""Quo vadis domine"" (Whither goest thou, master?), to which Christ replied ""To Rome, to be crucified anew.""This apocryphal legend is in fact the beginning of Peter's own martyrdom. This would certainly explain the vigorous movements in Carracci's painting, with the apostle recoiling in terror. It is not the unexpected encounter with the risen Christ that has taken the apostle aback, but his awareness of his own human frailty. Annibale's magnificent rhetoric reminds the spectator of Christ's call to turn back.The viewer is on the Appian Way with Peter, or rather, is Peter meeting Christ. The foot of the cross protrudes from the panel, Christ's hand points outwards, and the shadows he casts attest to his corporeality as he strides toward us. While Peter's left foot remained in place, the rest of the figure was altered during painting, drawn back to the right edge of the panel in an attitude half-way between terror and obeisance, more deeply felt than his earlier pose but also making room for our implied presence. Firm contours delimit Christ's athletic bo,dy, yet its internal modelling is subtly lifelike, rippling with the movement of muscles and the angle at which surfaces catch the light. It is obvious that this figure was based on a live model, for his hands and lower legs are more sunburnt than his torso and thighs, although the face he turns to Peter is an idealised mask of pathos under the crown of thorns. Despite the dual sources of light from the background and in the foreground, the same sun seems to warm sky, trees, fields and Roman temples, and the crimson, white, gold and blue draperies, the metal keys, the youthful and the aged flesh and the chestnut and grizzled hair of the two wayfarers at the crossroads between time and eternity"

21935-1adorati.jpg	Since the Early Christian era, the 6 January has been celebrated as the feast of Epiphany, the appearance of God amongst men in the form of Jesus Christ. Mankind is represented by the Three Kings, who are paying homage to the Messiah. The fall of the pagan world began at the same time as his appearance. Leonardo appears to have depicted this moment, so dramatic in human history, in his panel. It remained unfinished because Leonardo left Florence and moved to Milan, though we do not know why he did so. Chemical reactions and soiling mean it is now difficult to read this fascinating panel in detail.With this painting Leonardo declares his independence from Verrocchio, emerging with a fresh, personal style. Although unfinished, this painting is far more innovative than his previous works. The composition is constructed around a central, pyramidal grouping of figures, and, most significantly, Leonardo here incorporates lights and darks in the underdrawing of this painting.Even though the panel remained unfinished, the Adoration of the Magi, with its symmetrically composed main group which differs from the traditional linear composition, is now considered one of the most progressive works in Florentine painting. It puts into practice the demands Alberti made of history paintings in a way no other work in its era does. All the figures are involved in the events in the picture. The distinguished kings display their emotions in a more dignified manner than the accompanying figures around them, and the overall number of participants is kept within moderation. The figures are grouped in a circle around Mary and are expressing, with more or less vigorous gestures, their emotion at the first demonstration of divinity of the Christ Child.The painting also differs from the traditional way of depicting the Adoration in Florence by means of the puzzling scenes in the background, the equestrian battles and an unfinished staircase. This led to the assumption that the Augustinian convent of San Donato in Scopeto, which had commissioned the picture, wanted to use this picture composition in order to convey its own theological interpretation of the Adoration theme

31112-3burial1.jpg	At the end wall of the chapel, around the stain-glass window and below the prophets were placed the Burial of the Wood (on the left) and the Torture of the Jew (on the right). These two stories were painted by Piero's main assistant Giovanni da Piamonte, who used the cartoons by Piero.The scene of the burial of the beam is shown in a narrow panel. The diagonal beam, carried by several men, extends across nearly the whole picture, forming an X with the outline of the background mountain slope.In the Burial of the Wood, Giovanni da Piamonte's heavy modelling draws the stiff folds of the bearer's garments and their hair, rather mechanically tied in bunches. On the Cross the vein of the wood, like an elegant decorative element, forms a halo above the head of the first bearer, who thus appears as a prefiguration of Christ on the way to Calvary.

19592-virginch.jpg	This is a rare early work by Jan Sanders van Hemessen. Painted in the late 1520s on his return from a lengthy trip to Italy, the panel already demonstrates signs of the classicising elegance that he learned from his studies of Raphael and the young Bronzino, as well as the sense of form and monumentality that he would have seen and studied in the work of Michelangelo.Hemessen's interest in and tendency to include a variety of flora and fauna in a highly naturalistic setting is perhaps one of his most distinguishable characteristics and features prominently in all his works of an external setting.

32527-2josephi.jpg	Prud'hon started to paint in a style that was entirely rooted in the 18th century. His subjects were taken from Antiquity, but sfumato and grace, the gentle folds of cloth and the idealized little faces of his girlish fairies show him to be one of the last elegiac representatives of the Rococo. We encounter him only rarely as a Neoclassical painter of the linear style, and if so, the mood of the end of the Rococo period is very evident. This is clear in the full-figure portrait of The Empress Josephine, in which the late 18th-century love of nature is still having its effect. The meditative gaze that the Empress is directing on to an antique urn touched the central nerve of the time

32955-09julius.jpg	"Portraits of Julius II as an old man exist in three versions: in the National Gallery, London, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence and in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence. A thorough investigation of the London painting has proved it to be the original. The version in the Uffizi is now said to be from Raphael's workshop, while that in the Palazzo Pitti has been attributed to Titian by some experts.Pope Julius II gave this painting to the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, where after his death it was displayed on important feast days. In 1591 Cardinal Sfondorato sold it to Scipione Borghese. Its provenance until its acquisition by the National Gallery in 1824 is also documented, so that it can be said with certainty that the London picture is authentic, despite the other existing versions.The Pope who had commissioned the pictorial cycles and the works that had so contributed to the artist's fame, is depicted - according to historical sources, in the master's hand - in a portrait ""so animated and true to life that it was frightening to behold, as though it were actually alive"" (Vasari).The painting shows the Pope seated with the tiara on his head, dressed in a white surplice and a purple mantle. Here the simple but effective tonal contrast, first used in the Portrait of a Cardinal, reappears. The Pope, though old, still seems very vigorous and the Della Rovere energy is clearly visible in the hand that grasps the right arm of the chair with strength and pride. The two acorn-shaped knobs on the back of the chair recall the Pope's coat of arms. The intimacy of the image indicates that Raphael has progressed from the narrative compositions of the Vatican Stanze to the full dominance of individual subjectivity.The pattern of papal keys and tiaras just visible in the green curtain was originally painted gold to simulate embroidery, and the artist's change of mind, disclosed when the painting was scientifically assessed in 1969 prior to cleaning, is one of the main reasons for its acceptance as the original of several versions of the portrait.The picture can be dated by Julius's beard, which he grew as a token of mortification at having lost the city of Bologna in 1511 and had shaved off by March 1512. He was to die at 70 the following year. A choleric and active man, much criticised during his turbulent pontificate for personally leading his troops in strenuous military campaigns, he is represented as at once forceful - as in the left hand - aristocratic the right hand - and meditative. The portrait is in every way worthy of a patron unique in the history of art, a pope discerning and fortunate enough to have been served by three of the greatest artists of the High Renaissance - the architect Bramante, Michelangelo and Raphael"

The earliest of the last named, dated 1649, predates van Beyeren's earliest pronkstilleven, a fact that supports the claim that the fish painter Pieter de Putter (c. 1600-59) was his teacher.Van Beyeren's fish pieces seldom attract as much attention as his sumptuous banquet tables. Most people would rather study a picture of an exquisitely laid table than one of a mess of fish. But van Beyeren's celebrations of the abundance of the sea are as remarkable as his festive dinner tables. In them he sometimes includes a glimpse of a beach in the background. The fish and crustacea he painted always look wet - they appear to have been just taken from the water - and the mother-of pearl greys of his creatures of the sea, their browns, silvers, and white are as delicate and finely felt as the colour accords in his more showy pieces

40994-04diptyc.jpg	The left-hand panel of this diptych depicts the adoration of the Infant Jesus by the Magi; the right-hand panel represents the Crucifixion.Seated on her canopied bed, the Virgin receives the homage of the Magi, who are taking off their crowns. In the upper left corner we can see the Magi and their horses assembling from different directions. In the bottom right corner Joseph is sitting; when the guests arrived he was warming his feet at a brazier. Now, like the Magi, he, too, takes off his headgear with a humble gesture. (If we want to find the prototype of the figure, we could see it in the representations of the month of February in calendars of books of hours: the figure of an elderly man warming himself at the fire was the personification of February.)The picture is a strange mixture of marked condensation and of anecdotal details. The story is circumstantially told by merely putting the most important characters and d�cor side by side. The wealth of small objects set beside one another gradually overlap and cover the whole surface of the picture. The Virgin's canopied bed is a throne too, while its top has a double role and is also the roof of the Bethlehem building crowded with dovecotes. The space left empty by the structure of the bed-throne is filled up by a bastion. Space, as a substance, is not conveyed; the motifs are linked with one another in the way the words of a sentence are. The star, for example, is given emphasis by the small spot of nocturnal darkness surrounding it and separating it from the golden background

It was during this time that he drew many subjects from brothel life, including anything from the laundresses to the most intimate scenes between the women who lived in the brothel.It was in the salon, the brothel's reception room, that the women awaited their customers.

One of rembrandt's earliest paintings shows an angel interfering in human life, and it is derived from a similar work by Lastman.The biblical story (Num. 22:1-35) represented here is the following. The arrival of the Israelites in the Jordan valley alarmed Balak, king of Moab, who sent for Balaam, a foreigner, to pronounce a curse on them. On his journey an angel, invisible to Balaam, barred the way, causing his ass to turn aside. This led to an altercation between the man and his beast in which the latter, like the animals of fable, acquired the gift of speech. Balaam's eyes were then opened and he saw the angel with a drawn sword. The conversion of Balaam by the vision of the angel was regarded as prefiguration of the appearance of Christ to the apostle Thomas

30252-conversa.jpg	The Sacra conversazione (holy conversation) involving the Madonna and Christ Child with saints (in this case St John the Baptist and St Catherine) was a genre in which Palma Vecchio excelled. These works were painted for wealthy patrons and were intended for private devotion in a domestic environment. The figures are normally shown half-length, the Madonna and Child painted on the same scale as the figures venerating them, and they all appear to co-exist in the same picture space, without the hierarchy so typical of Renaissance triptychs and polyptychs.Although Palma was a pioneer in the genre he often had recourse to Titian's works, as is the case here.

02964-sacred2.jpg	"Baglione painted this canvas, alongside of another version now in Berlin, for the Cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani. The two works follow on the heels of and make reference to Caravaggio's Love Victorious, painted in 1601 for the Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani.The canvas dates to just before the famous court trial that marked Baglione's definitive split with the circle of his contemporary, Caravaggio: it is thus a document of the phase of Baglione's career in which he most closely approximated Caravaggio's methods. Baglione was originally trained as a painter in the late mannerist style, and was active in major papal commissions at the end of the sixteenth century. He was the first painter to attach himself to the new naturalistic vision of Caravaggio, a style that had its official debut in that painter's work at San Luigi dei Francesi in the Jubilee Year of 1600. While there is no doubt that Baglione modelled the National Gallery picture on Caravaggio's Love Victorious, the artist took a completely new point of view. Uniting the figures to the dark background against which they stand out, he uses an intense and direct spotlighting that creates strong chiaroscuro contrasts. The legacy of late mannerism matrix is evident in both the compositions of the individual figures, above all the attenuated proportions of Sacred Love, and in the rich, complex attire, which departs from Caravaggesque prototypes.Derived from the Psychomachia of Prudentius, the moralizing theme of combat between the vices and the virtues was interpreted by Virgil in ""Omnia vincit Amor"". Later codified by Petrarch, the theme enjoyed a new popularity in the early seventeenth century. The face of the figure of the devil at the left has been identified as a portrait of Caravaggio. This canvas includes a satirical condemnation of both Caravaggio's art and his moral scruples, making what is tantamount to a visual charge of sodomy. Divine Love interrupts a tryst between Cupid and the Devil, who turns toward the viewer in anguished surprise revealing Caravaggio's likeness.The painting is signed and dated: ""IO BAGLIONE/R:F:/1602"

03756-015trans.jpg	The painting was for long attributed to Mantegna (whose spurious initial can be seen below right), so close is Bellini's painting to the work of his brother-in-law in this period.The composition shows Elijah and Moses on Mount Tabor on either side of Christ, while below them are the disciples Peter, James and John blinded by the vision, according to the iconography suggested by the Synoptic Gospel. The composition was conceived according to a stratified ascending movement culminating in the figure of Christ, who is clothed in an ethereal pearly-white robe. The figures' shoulders and heads are forced into extreme foreshortening, dictated by the suggestion of the extraordinary Mantegnesque talent for perspective, but the stretch of landscape on the left is already expanded into an image of moving realism.The panel, which is damaged at the top, probably comes from the church of San Giobbe

19882-2gisze.jpg	From the objects shown in this portrait it is evident that the sitter was anxious that not only his likeness but also something of his way of life should be presented. A Latin couplet above the merchant's head intimates how faithfully the artist has rendered every aspect of the man : `What you see here, this picture, shows Georg's features and figure such is his eye in real life, such is the shape of his cheeks.' Yet it is clear from the very form this couplet takes that the picture is meant to convey more than outward appearances and to underline the humanist milieu in which the merchant wished to be seen. The same mood is implicit in a Latin motto inscribed on the rear wall immediately beside a pair of scales: `Nulla sine merore voluptas' (`No joy without sorrow').The merchant is depicted standing in his workroom, behind a table covered with a richly embroidered cloth. Among the many objects on the table and the wall which illustrate his trade, the Venetian-glass vase, containing carnations and other flowers, clearly has a special significance; in the medieval language of symbols the carnation was a sign of betrothal.From the shelf in the top right-hand corner several keys, signet-rings and a spherical container are hanging, the latter presumably containing string. On the table is a pewter writing-stand with goose-feathers, ink, sand, wax disks and sealing-wax. Beside it are a pair of scissors, a signet-ring and a seal. Near the table's edge, precisely placed in the centre foreground, stands a small table-clock which, together with the fragile glass vase and the perishable flowers, is a reminder of the passage of time, as was the hour-glass in earlier pictures.The name Georg Gisze occurs frequently and appears several times in various styles of handwriting on the documents attached to the wall. From the letter in the merchant's hand one gathers that he has been corresponding with a brother in Germany. The subject of the portrait, the son of an alderman, was born in Danzig in 1497. Holbein painted him in London in 1532. Three years later Gisze married in Danzig, and we may assume that the portrait was commissioned in anticipation of the marriage.The painting was in the Duke of Orleans' collection in 1727 and appeared in the inventories until 1788. The collection was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1793 and put up for auction. The Swiss publisher and copper-engraver Christian von Mechel acquired the picture and tried in vain to persuade the Basel Library to buy it. For about twenty years it remained in Switzerland without finding a purchaser, until Edward Solly acquired it at a very low price. In 1821 it found its way into the Berlin Museum with the rest of the Solly Collection

29271-205muril.jpg	This is the first dated work executed after Murillo's return to Seville from Madrid. It was intended for the chapel of the Immaculate Conception in the cathedral. In this painting Murillo abandons the hard-edged technique of his youth and adopts the open, sketchy brushwork learned in Madrid. Under the glow of soft light, the figures dissolve into the ambient space, intensifying the tender sentiment of the narrative. St Anne lies in a canopied bed, attended by Joachim, while the newborn infant is removed from the bath by a rotund, matronly woman. The baby is handed for drying to a helper, with assistance from two putti, who remove toweling from a wicker basket. A young woman carrying the clothing emerges from the shadow, and two angels sweetly genuflect before the radiant child

15230-3ossian.jpg	"The commission for this painting was given to G�rard in 1801 for the decoration of the small palace of Malmaison, which Napoleon was having furnished for his own use. Two paintings on the subject of Ossian were to flank the chimney breast in the reception room. The other was to be painted by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roucy-Trioson. They were the only two paintings to praised by the owner of the palace, and not without reason. Napoleon was also seized by the current wave of enthusiasm for the prose epics of the legendary Gaelic poet Ossian.Ossian purports to be a translation of an epic cycle of Scottish poems from the early dark ages. Ossian, a blind bard, sings of the life and battles of Fingal, a Scotch warrior. Ossian caused a sensation when it was published on the cusp of the era of revolutions, and had a massive cultural impact during the 18th and 19th centuries. Napoleon carried a copy into battle; Goethe translated parts of it; the city of Selma, Alabama was named after the home of Fingal, and one of Ingres' most romantic and moody paintings, the Dream of Ossian was based on it. The originator of the ""unearthed, old Irish fragments"" Fingal and Temora, published in 1762 and 1763, was a Scot, James Macpherson (1736-1796). Ten years after Macpherson's death it was discovered that the poems were forgeries, written by Macpherson himself from fragments of sagas.There are at least four versions of G�rard's painting. The Ossian Awakening the Spirits on the Banks of the Lora with the Sound of his Harp in Hamburg came from Malmaison. The blind singer is engrossed in his song, his pale hair tousled and his head bent. His fingers grip the strings, and in the moonlight the dream figures appear, the heroes of his song: on his throne Fingal, who is Ossian's father, beside him Malwina, and behind them the train of warriors."

11155-1870s_17b.jpg	There are three similar versions of this scene, and their precise relationship has bedeviled scholars for decades. The largest, painted in grisaille (Mus�e d'Orsay, Paris), appeared in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. The two others, tentatively dated the same year, are in the Metropolitan's collection. This painting probably preceded the version in pastel, which is more freely handled.

43774-09loveso.jpg	"During the early eighteenth century the lute was replaced by guitar in the artistic depiction of musical groups and other amorous scenes. The fashionable instrument appears in a number of Watteau's canvases showing garden parties or intimate duets. The erotic connotation remained unchanged.Watteau's contemporary Bernard Picard accompanied his engraving entitled Concert in the Park with a few playful couplets about the contest between Apollo and Amor, which can be summed up this way: ""Both of them was victorious; Apollo at the beginning, Amor at the end."" The contemporary public certainly noted the piquant allusions and understood the ironic innuendo.The painting depicts the moment when the two musicians ""tune on"" before a performance. The singer gives the initial tone, and the accompanist finds the matching chord. This playful context is well matched by the virtuoso placing of the two figures within the diagonal composition, by the gentle harmony of pastel colours and by the formal lightness of the composition"

32792-28unicor.jpg	The painting earlier was attributed to Perugino, Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, Granacci. At the time (in 1928) of the identification of the artist as Raphael, the painting had been heavily painted over to represent a St Catherine. After careful cleaning, the perfect geometry and detachment of this courtly figure were revealed, although her identity is not known. Present day critics attribute the work to Raphael, referring it to 1505 and to the Florentine environment. It can, in fact, be inserted among the portraits of that period, for it represents an apex in the artist's stylistic development. The fullness of the well constructed figure is set apart from a vast landscape background, inspired by Leonardo but executed with the clarity typical of Raphael. Piero della Francesca and Perugino influences have also been noted in the style of the painting

10618-evening.jpg	Cuyp also made paintings of the lively activity on the great rivers of the Netherlands, most often the wide Merwede that forks at Dordrecht into the North Maas and Lower Maas. It was Dordrecht's location at this juncture that made it one of the principal cities of the country until traffic on the Maas was diverted to Rotterdam.Cuyp's river scenes are usually set late in the afternoon and are seen against a luminous, sunny sky that sparkles and glistens on the calm water. He knew Dutch river life intimately. He travelled up the Rhine, and along the Maas, and the Waal making numerous drawings of huge sailing vessels, small craft, rafts, and also views of the land from the water. He was equally at home working on a large or a small scale, and could fill a canvas with the massive dark hull and rigging of a clumsy passage boat making way to a pier or with the decorative and elegant silhouettes of colourful figures on horseback riding into the evening sky . In grandeur of composition Cuyp often matches Ruisdael and the best of Hobbema's work. As a colourist he seems even superior by the glow and richness of his warm palette both in his land and sea pictures.

43369-coronati.jpg	In 1444 Antonio Vivarini and his brother-in-law Giovanni d'Alemagna, who both lived on the island of Murano near Venice, signed and dated this large altarpiece Coronation of the Virgin. Here Gothic, Byzantine, and renaissance elements blend in a strange amalgam. Saints and prophets are seated in tiers like choir stalls, as if heaven were the apse of a gigantic church. Rows of angels bring the altarpiece to a dome-like top.The entire centre of the structure, from the checkered marble pavement to the apex of the animated dome, is filled with a fantastic throne containing Late Gothic motifs and vaguely Byzantine columns with foliated capitals. Between the columns and around them, infants carry the symbols of Christ's Passion. Between the spiral columns of the upper stories of the throne, God the Father blesses Christ, who crowns his mother, while the dove of the Holy Spirit hovers between them

32269-21parnas.jpg	Nicolas Poussin was undoubtedly the most important French artist of the seventeenth century, and the major exponent of Baroque classicism. Although he worked in Rome most of his life, his influence not only in Italy but also on French painting was profound. His art was richly informed by prolonged study of the classical past and of the High Renaissance - both of classical sculpture and of Raphael and Titian. He created an extraordinarily controlled, balanced and also various blend from these and other sources, evolving original solutions to traditional problems. The Parnassus is one example.Poussin paid homage to his revered forerunner Raphael by taking the latter's Parnassus fresco as the starting-point for a painting of the same subject. The poet being crowned with laurels is sometimes identified as Marino, Poussin's early patron, who had died earlier in 1625

43578-2fortun.jpg	"On the back of the canvas, in capital letters, is the following inscription: ""aegiptia. vulgo. zingara. fatvi. cerdonis. divinatrix. a. Simoe. Voet. ad. vivum. depicta. MCDXVII"" - (The Egyptian woman, (called) commonly ""the gypsy, fortuneteller of the foolish artisan"", painted from life by Simon Vouet 1617)This painting was once considered to be a copy of another painting of similar measurements and subject, preserved in Florence (Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti) with an attribution to Antiveduto della Gramatica or Bartolomeo Manfredi. Recently, however, the painting has been reattributed to Simon Vouet on the basis of the lengthy inscription found on the back of the canvas during restoration. Examination of the Barberini picture also revealed a series of substantial pentimenti (repainted passages), especially in the young man's clothing, that confirm that this is the original and that the Florentine painting must be a copy.The large capital letters of the inscription and its content also confirm that the work was in the collection of Cassiano dal Pozzo. A Francophile who was always connected to French interests in Rome, Cassiano commissioned the painting in 1617 directly from the young Vouet. This is the moment in which Vouet, painter to the King of France, is first documented as active in Rome. Among the works sold in the sale of the dal Pozzo heirs, the painting resurfaced at the end of the eighteenth century in the Torlonia Collection. From there it passed into the holdings of the National Gallery.The simplicity of the composition, which includes only three half figures, derives from the Caravaggesqueprototypes that Vouet would have been able to see in the collection of Cassiano's friend Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte. Likewise, the situation of the spotlit figures in a shadowy space and the intense exchange of gazes between the two younger people recall the works of Caravaggio. On the other hand, though, the distinct interpretation of Caravaggesque style attests to the profound influence on Vouet of the manner of Manfredi, then at the apex of his own career. Manfredian style is evident in the rich and surprisingly intact pictorial material, the agility of brushwork, and the extraordinary mastery of pictorial rendering. These qualities, as well as the vivacious chromatic range sustained by the young gypsy's red sleeve, reveal precociously the powerful characteristics of a great painter.In contrast to Caravaggio's two-figure treatment of the same theme, from which this picture clearly derives, Vouet inserts the figure of the old gypsy to the right, whose left hand picks the man's pocket while her right hand, laid on his shoulder, makes a vulgar gesture. As well known and ancient gesture, the thumb stuck between the first two fingers was particularly common in Tuscany and is even mentioned by Dante in the Divine Comedy. (Inferno XX, 2)"

38675-concer.jpg	Ter Borch's fame rests mainly upon the genre pictures he made after the middle of the 17th century which help define the subjects and pictorial schemes used by many artists of his generation and those who worked later. What sets him apart is his mastery of subtle narration which can charge every episode with subdued tension.In contrast to Pieter de Hooch, Ter Borch maintains his fine taste and craftsmanship in his genre pieces until the very end. His contact with Vermeer in Delft in 1635 may have had an impact on the younger master. Then there conceivably was a shift; some of Ter Borch's late works seem to show a sign of Vermeer's influence. The fullness and clarity of the foreground figure playing the cello in the Concert at Berlin and the bright illumination of the room recall the Delft master; but it is also possible that the two artists arrived at similar solutions independently. In any event, the Ter Borch, the exquisite and minute treatment of materials, textures, and stuffs with the most intricate light accents is completely personal. The spatial relationships are not grasped with Vermeer's sureness, and the composition lacks the Delft painter's masterly consideration of the surface plane and the adjustment of the spatial accents to the overall design.It will be noted that the figure playing the harpsichord has no Ter Borch character. Originally this figure represented a man. Ter Borch subsequently transformed the man into a woman, and a whimsical restorer, who worked on the picture at the end of the 19th century because of its bad state of presentation, changed the woman's gown and gave the model his wife's features.

07278-canal807.jpg	This night view &#151; one of two Canaletto is known to have made &#151; represents the Feast of Saint Martha, a popular festival celebrated every year on the eve of the saints feastday (29 July) in the poor fishing neighbourhood around the church by the same name, situated on the extreme southwestern point of the city on the Canale della Giudecca. What made the festival unique was that here, for one evening of gorging and dancing, the strict distinction between the nobility, the burghers and the poor fisher-folk was suspended.From the bank between the water and the houses the view is toward the west, where the church of Santa Marta closes off the buildings. To the left of the church the silhouette of the island of San Giorgo in Alga appears on the horizon, in the left corner is a house on another small island. Fishing boats decorated with balloons sail about, while tents and windscreens for the many musicians and cooks are spread over the grounds. A gondoliers assistant and his lady dance the furlana to the accompaniment of violin, guitar and tamborine, while a distinguished- looking foreigner is cajoled into dancing by a woman of the working class.The multitude of diverse visual elements has been neatly arranged by Canaletto along two crossing diagonals, with the church at the point of intersection. The artist chose a somewhat elevated vantage point, making it possible to survey a wide variety of individual scenes at the same time. It is not clear whether such a point of view was indeed possible on the spot. What is certain is that Canaletto first drew the various parts separately on several sheets; of these, two have survived with fragments of the houses in the background, which the artist must have sketched from different spots. With the help of these he built up the composition, according to a scheme identical to that of the diplomatic receptions painted on various different occasions. The painting is something of a humorous commentary on this: the people's festival supplants the public one, just as the moon does the sun.Canaletto painted the canvas for the merchant Sigismund Streit, who was originally from Berlin. Streit had made his fortune in Venice after settling there as a young man in 1705. When he retired from business in 1750, he devoted himself to study and to the accumulation of a modest collection of paintings. Part of his painting collection has been preserved, including four canvases by Canaletto among them the Vigilia di Santa Marta and the Vigilia di San Pietro, another night view

10945-milksoup.jpg	Several versions of this picture are known, all attributed to Gerard David, whose style and painting technique they display. The presentation of the Virgin in the foreground, half turned toward the viewer, allows us to enter the intimacy of this domestic interior, with its window opened onto a contemporary townscape. A basket and a prayer-book taken out of its cover are lying on a console against the wall. To the left, a cupboard carries an earthenware jug and a small bunch of flowers. As an attentive mother, the Virgin delicately takes the soup for her Son whom she is holding seated on her knees. He is dressed in a light linen shirt and is also playing at holding a wooden spoon. This highly realistic representation of a spoon-fed meal is a variation of the theme, more common at the time, of the Virgin nursing the Child. The Child fed by the Virgin is a metaphor of the believer nourished by his mother the Church and by Christ himself. The bread at the front of the scene and the jug on the cupboard are the eucharistic symbols of his body and his blood. The very idea of Christ's incarnation through which humanity has been saved is evoked here.The picture, intended for private devotion, is conceived in a manner typical of the late Middle Ages. By handling the subject as a contemporary scene, the painter abolishes the frontier between the spiritual and the material worlds, calling on the believer to live his faith directly and individually. Conceived for private use, the Virgin and Child with the Milk Soup was probably painted many times over, as testified by other extant versions. The Brussels painting has been produced using a pattern containing the entire composition, which was also applied for another version conserved at Genoa. A variation of this pattern was used for two other versions conserved in New York and San Diego. It would appear that the painter had a basic layout which could be adapted according to his clients' wishes. This phenomenon illustrates the development of the art of the Flemish Primitives, who at the end of the 15th century were faced with growing demand from their bourgeois clients. The various versions coming from Gerard David's workshop suggests that a part of work must have been undertaken by his assistants

29364-0view2.jpg	The Strozzi Chapel contains one of the most important altarpieces of the Trecento, painted by Orcagna (Andrea di Cione) between 1354 and 1357. The frescoes in the chapel were probably painted at the same time as the retable by Nardo di Cione, the brother of Orcagna.In nearly a complete departure from earlier family chapels, the fresco program is devoted almost exclusively to a depiction of the Last Judgment, which takes up all three walls. The pictorial program of the frescoes is articulated like a triptych, with the Last Judgment on the west wall as the core of the ensemble and Paradise on the south wall as the pendant to Hell on the north wall.The picture shows the Strozzi Chapel from the east. On the west wall is the Last Judgment, on the south wall (left) the Paradise, on the north wall (right) the Hell can be seen.The figures in the stained glass window are the Madonna and Child, and the Dominican Saint Thomas Aquinas

32211-16baccha.jpg	In the Bacchanal: the Andrians in the Louvre, the mood is even lighter than in the Munich Apollo and Daphne or the Louvre Triumph of Flora, although the colours retain a Venetian richness. In these pictures, Poussin was trying to express his personal vision of the lushness and extravagance of antiquity, tinged with a certain sadness. In some cases he succeeded, although in a number of others his use of a dark ground has caused excessive darkening and the pictures have sometimes lost their brilliance.The Andrians were the inhabitants of the Aegean island of Andros, famous for its wine, and therefore a centre of the worship of Bacchus in antiquity. Legend told that the god visited the island annually when a fountain of water turned into wine.

06513-09nester.jpg	Painted in the year before the artist's death, this painting, like other late works such as The Land of Cockaigne, The Peasant Dance and The Peasant Wedding, is dominated by monumental figures. Immediately after his return from Italy, Bruegel showed no apparent interest in Italian figure-types and compositions, reverting to the Antwerp tradition in which he had been trained. However, in these late works he shows that his study of Italian painting had taken root; these figures demonstrate his knowledge of Italian art and in particular the art of Michelangelo.This unusual subject apparently illustrates a Netherlandish proverb: 'He who knows where the nest is, has the knowledge; he who robs it, has the nest.' The painting presents a moralizing contrast between the active, wicked individual and the passive man who is virtuous in spite of adversity. It has been suggested that, with his knowledge of Italian art, Bruegel intended the peasant's gesture as a profane parody of the gesture of Leonardo's St John.It is not the birdnester whom Bruegel has placed in the foreground but the pensive man, who, his head slightly raised, has not noticed that he is about to fall into the brook. Bruegel will presumably have been interested less in the proverb than in the body of the young man, who is on the point of losing his balance and will fall forwards. In The Parable of the Blind, from the same year, the artist presents the observer with a side-on view of the different stages of falling

32630-beheadin.jpg	The beheading of Saint John the Baptist is one of the staple subjects of Christian art. The story's folk version, however, in which a femme fatale has the saint killed because of her desire for him, had from the sixteenth century informed erotic pictures depicting Salome carrying the Baptist's severed head, often the artist's self portrait. This theme was revived in 1841 by Heinrich Heine in his exotic poem Atta Troll, and quickly became fashionable in all the arts.The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist exemplifies Puvis's ideals and methods. While the picture is almost certainly unfinished, its lean paint surface is characteristic of the artist. During his travels he had fallen in love with 'Italian Primitive' frescoes, and it was their flat, matt surfaces that he tried to imitate.Puvis de Chavannes's composition is derived from church frescoes. Bodies - like the Moor's muscular back - are distorted to appear parallel to the picture surface, or at right angles to it in strict profile. Perspective is suppressed, and space behind the fig tree is patterned by its branches into two-dimensional shapes

21278-allegor2.jpg	Although the Parisian painter La Hire seems never to have travelled to Italy, he was well aware - through study at Fontainebleau and through the work of contemporary artists like Vouet, Poussin and Claude - of the achievements of the Italian Renaissance. He became a major exponent of a restrained and refined classical manner fashionable in the French capital. The sculptural clarity and weight of the figure in this allegorical painting, the measured regularity of the composition with its emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines, the even lighting and discrete local colour can all be contrasted with the sweeping movement, dramatic play of light, shade, textures and reflections in Baroque works by contemporaries like Rembrandt.This unlikely gardener represents Grammar and is one of a series of personifications of the Seven Liberal Arts painted to decorate a room in the Paris town house of G�d�on Tallemant, one of the counsellors of King Louis XIII. The Liberal Arts were the literary trio, Grammar, Rhetoric and Dialectic, and the mathematical quartet of Arithmetic, Music, Geometry and Astronomy. It had long been traditional to decorate private studios and libraries with their images. They were always shown as women, in keeping with the feminine gender of the Latin nouns grammatica, rhetorica etc., which retain their femininity in all the Romance languages. The other paintings of these high-minded ladies by La Hire survive, dispersed in various collections. We do not know precisely how they were arranged in the room, but the pictures, of different sizes, were probably set into carved panelling and hung above head height.The Latin legend on Grammar's winding ribbon can be translated as 'A learned and articulate voice spoken in a correct manner'. The function of Grammar among the Liberal Arts was not to parse sentences or teach conjugations but to ensure that ideas could be communicated clearly and effectively. In Cesare Ripa's illustrated dictionary of personifications of concepts, the Iconologia, first published in 1593, a book much used by painters, the author comments, 'Like young plants, young brains need watering and it is the duty of Grammar to undertake this.' La Hire shows Grammar, with a homely jug, watering primulas and anemones in terracotta pots as lovingly studied from the object as any kitchenware by Chardin. The overflow runs off through the drainage hole onto a fragment of antique Roman wall or pillar ornamented with an egg-and-dart frieze. Behind her, grand fluted Roman columns and a Roman urn close off our view into the garden beyond the wall, but the mood is as friendly and serene as if she were nursing her plants on a balcony in a quiet Paris backwater away from the traffic, airing the ravishing harmonies of her shot-silk gown and mild blue cloak

42635-31lovel.jpg	Signature: Signed on the wall, to the left of the servant.Provenance: The identification with no. 7 of the Amsterdam sale, 1696, can apply to this painting as well as to the Lady with a Maidservant Holding a Letter (Frick Collection, New York). Collection Pieter van Lennep, and his wife, Margaretha Cornelis Kops, then their daughter Margaretha Catharina van Lennep, and her husband, Jan Messchert van Vollenhoven. His sale, Amsterdam, 1892. In the museum since 1893.In this painting, the use of the inverted Galilean telescope is apparent without doubt. We look at the principal scene through a doorway. The foreground is enhanced, dark, and lacks precision in the map on the left wall.The identical map recurs distinctly rendered in the Officer with a Laughing Girl (Frick Collection, New York). The other objects nearest the viewer are also muted and almost blurred. On the other hand, the mistress and her maid, as well as the room in which they are placed, are well defined in spite of their recession into space.The composition is attractive and treated in a decorative manner, although the two figures are devoid of individualization and resemble puppets rather than persons. Part of this shallowness may be due to damage from the theft and subsequent holding for ransom of the painting, which occurred at an exhibition in Brussels in 1971. The picture suffered much more than was later admitted, and no restorer, however skilful, can equal Vermeer.

43546-nativity.jpg	Three little angels kneel with Mary and Joseph in worship of the newborn Child. The ox and the ass stand behind them. Other angels in the distance announce the birth of Christ to a group of shepherds. The ruin behind Joseph symbolises the defeat of paganism by the coming of the Saviour. The artist has made the symbolism even plainer by including a relief in the classical ruin - a recumbent female nude, possibly Venus, and several playful little naked figures. These represent the pagan world and 'impure', earthly love, as opposed to the divine love in which Christ was conceived.Marten de Vos spent some time in Italy, where he familiarised himself with the new art of the Renaissance. This is apparent in details like the lively poses, the realistic approach to the anatomy and the references to classical antiquity. The divided upper zone, one half containing an architectural setting and the other a deep landscape, was also typical of 16th-century Venetian art.

24133-3cybele1.jpg	From 1490 onwards, Mantegna produced a series of illusionistic works representing sculptural reliefs in marble or bronze. These are in grisaille, light and dark tones of a single colour creating figures that stand against a background simulating boldly patterned marble. In Italy, pictures like this, which appear to be carved in stone, were first seen in the bases of Giotto's frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua, where he illustrated the seven Virtues and seven Vices. At the end of the 15th century, grisaille work was in great demand, and Mantegna painted a number of pictures in this technique.The present painting was one of a series of four long, narrow paintings ordered from Mantegna by Francesco Cornaro at the beginning of 1505. Mantegna was able to complete only this painting before his death. However, sketches for the others still exist and the rest of the series was completed on this basis, in Venice; among these is the Continence of Scipio by Giovanni Bellini.At the end of the second Punic War, a Sybilline oracle predicted that a Roman victory would be hastened if they brought the foreign goddess Cybele to Rome. So in 204 BC, the Roman Senate decided that as the most distinguished of all the Romans, the still youthful patrician Publius Cornelius Scipio (235-183 BC) should receive the goddess and give her shelter in his house until a temple had been built.From the left of the painting the priests in their flowing robes are approaching with a bust of Cybele. A young follower falls on his knees in reverence, his position in the centre of the picture emphasizing the unusually wide format of this work. Scipio leads out the group of Romans who have been awaiting the arrival of this image of the goddess, which has been brought fromAsia Minor

13037-cupid.jpg	Cupid and Psyche is without doubt one of the most beautiful paintings undertaken by Van Dyck for Charles I. It is a late work, possibly dating from 1639-40, thinly painted throughout with several changes visible to the naked eye and some passages, particularly in the landscape, unresolved to the extent that the painting might not have been properly finished. Significantly, when first recorded in the Long Gallery at Whitehall Palace the picture was unframed. Both these factors might have some bearing on the circumstances of the commission. It has been suggested, for example, that the subject relates to the decoration of the Queen's Cabinet at Greenwich, which was initiated towards the end of 1639 by Rubens and Jacob Jordaens but was never completed - although a certain amount of preparatory material by Jordaens is recorded. Alternatively, the painting could have been made in the context of the celebrations for the marriage of Princess Mary to William II of Orange (April-May 1641).The story of Cupid and Psyche was well known at the English court. The source is The Golden Ass by Apuleius (Books 4-6). Van Dyck has chosen the moment when Cupid discovers Psyche overcome by sleep after opening the casket which Venus had requested her to bring back, unopened, from Proserpine in Hades. This was one of the tricks set by Venus in Psyche's attempt to find Cupid. Compositionally, there is a kinship with paintings of Adam and Eve or the Annunciation. It is stated traditionally that Psyche's features resembled those of Van Dyck's mistress, Margaret Lemon.Van Dyck's role as court painter seems primarily to have been directed towards portraiture, even though he was a supremely able painter of poesie in the Italian tradition. Cupid and Psyche is the only mythological composition known to survive from the time of the artist's full employment at the English court (after 1632). Bellori records that other mythological paintings were made but these are now lost. This accounts for the long gap between the Rinaldo and Armida (Baltimore, Museum of Art), which the king commissioned in 1630 before the artist settled permanently in London, and Cupid and Psyche. In many ways the later painting may be seen as a summation of Van Dyck's art in this field. The composition successfully combines the artist's feeling for landscape with his understanding of the human form, both aspects being conveyed through superb draughtsmanship, here successfully conflated by the skilful use of diagonals. The sense of movement implied by Cupid's arrival contrasts with the stillness of Psyche asleep to create a tension that is the very essence of the picture, matching perfectly the contrast within the story itself between Beauty (Psyche) and Desire (Cupid). Such ethereal neo-Platonic ideals, which were open to various interpretations about love and the soul, were nurtured as part of the court life of Charles I and Henrietta Maria.Stylistically, the principal inspiration is Titian, whose pictures were such a major feature of Charles I's collection, but the highly charged poetic feeling, refined use of colours balancing warm and cold hues, and delicate modelling of human flesh that Van Dyck brings to the painting anticipate French Rococo art, especially the work of Watteau. In addition, it should not be forgotten that Cupid and Psyche was painted on the eve of the outbreak of the Civil War, so in many respects the choice of subject and the poetic intensity of the painting have a certain poignancy when seen in an historical context.

15497-2stigma.jpg	The second scene of the St Francis cycle in the Sassetti Chapel is underneath the Renunciation on the left wall: The Stigmata of St Francis. This event, the most important in the saint's life, encouraged his followers to raise him to messianic heights, for the miracle of the stigmata was the climax of his imitation of Christ. It is noticeable that this central event is not depicted in a prominent location in the chapel. Within the individual scenes of the cycle Ghirlandaio follows the compositional structure of postures of the main figures in Giotto's work, still his compulsory model. But the background proves that the frescoes belong to a new artistic era.At roughly the same time, in about 1485, a Florentine sculptor of the same age created this scene showing the stigmatization in marble for the pulpit of the Franciscan church of S. Croce in Florence: his name was Benedetto da Maiano, and he had, like Ghirlandaio, been commissioned by the wealthy banker Pietro Mellini to create a funeral monument in the form of a pulpit. The similarity between the two scenes is so great that one is forced to assume that one of the two artists copied the other in his own medium. The remaining scenes about St. Francis on Benedetto's pulpit are also in part comparable with Ghirlandaio's frescoes. This raises the question whether the sculptor was influenced by the painter, or the reverse, or whether both of them made use of the same models. Here the two artistic genres of painting and sculpture were competing with each other.St Francis led his life entirely according to the example of Christ. Two years before his death in 1224, he was miraculously marked with the wounds of the crucified Christ. This climax in the saint's life took place on the slopes of the La Verna mountain, where seraphim appeared to him bearing a vision of the crucified Christ and he received the wounds produced by the nails and lance.It should be noted that the stories, which are higher up and further from view, were probably left to his assistants: the Renunciation of Worldly Goods, the Test of Fire before the Sultan and the Stigmata.

25110-3diptych.jpg	The Master of the Legend of St Ursula was never a real imitator of Memling. Yet one cannot deny that the conception of the three portraits is unimaginable without the latter. The donors' panel is in structure as it were a simplified detail of the 1484 Moreel triptych )Groeninge Museum, Bruges) by Memling. The Virgin is less dependent upon Memling and typologically much closer to Dieric Bouts. The facial type with high rounded forehead and an inlet in the hair on both sides, and the Child with his awkwardly turned leg, are both typical. The motif of the book already appears in Van der Weyden's Dur�n Virgin Prado, Madrid) and was later used by various painters. The round throne and the canopy held open by angels is an invention of the master himself and a recurrent motif in his oeuvre.

32688-thetis.jpg	Achilles was the son of Thetis, a Nereid, or sea-nymph. Knowing the destiny in store for her son, she tried to protect him by dipping him at birth in the waters of the river Styx. This made his body invulnerable except for the heel by which she held him. However, later he was killed by Paris. As he knelt at an altar he was shot by an arrow guided by Apollo to his one vulnerable spot, his heel.This painting was executed and dated in Antwerp in a style close to that of his father

31064-2august1.jpg	"In 1454 Piero agreed to paint a polyptych for the Augustinians of Borgo San Sepolcro; the painting was to be finished within eight years and was intended for their monastery. As usual, the work was not completed until much later. The polyptych later dismembered and the panels were scattered. It was only in the twentieth century that scholars succeeded in reconstructing this work. Among the parts of the polyptych that have unfortunately not survived there is also the central panel which represented the Virgin Enthroned.St Augustine was one of the four side panels depicting four saints (St Augustine and St Michael at the left side and St John the Evangelist and St Nicholas of Tolentino at the right).St Augustine, portrayed with a mitre and a splendid bishop's cope is one of the high points of Piero's painting, for here he achieves perfect harmony between the imposing solidity of his three-dimensional forms and his miniaturistic attention to detail. Since the art of Gentile da Fabriano, no Italian painter had succeded in giving such a detailed reproduction of a saint's vestments. Piero paints every single scene depicted on this precious cope as though he were painting a small predella panel, using, for the soft decorations of the fabric, a ""dot"" technique worthy of a miniature by Fouquet. And yet, it is the monumental values that prevail in the figure of this austere saint"

37257-60medita.jpg	The episodes depicted in the middle level illustrate the last part of the saint's life, after 371 when Martin was nominated Bishop of Tours, as we can see from his mitre. In the bay to the left of the entrance we find the scene of the Meditation. In a state of profound spiritual ecstasy, Martin sits on a simple faldstool (the same one that Emperor Julian was sitting on in the scene of Martin renouncing arms), while two acolytes try to bring him back to reality so he can celebrate mass in the chapel nearby: one of them is shaking him gently, and the other is handing him his missal. The two architectural spaces, parallel but of different depth, are geometrically so simple and bare that they appear to reflect the Saint's mood of profound absorption in prayer: the only decorative elements are the horizontal Greek key design on the wall and the quatrefoiled ornament in the arch above the mullioned windows.Recently this scene was interpreted in another way. According to this interpretation the scene represents the Dream of St Ambrose, a premonition of the saint's death on the part of the bishop of Milan

30640-fruitven.jpg	A fruit seller and a young serving woman haggle over the price of a melon. The play of hands is indebted to Caravaggio, but its treatment is awkward. More assured is the still-life. The basket of fruit, which seems to jut over the table, and the wilting leaves suggesting the freshness of the fruit are motifs derived from Caravaggio's London Supper at Emmaus, and ones much favoured by still-life painters following him, such as Pietro Paolo Bonzi and the Master of the Acquavella Still-life. The melons, too, occur in pictures by these artists. Painted from three different viewpoints, and arranged on a parabola, they are veiled in a soft translucent light, and seem to detach themselves from the painting. They are strikingly close to the Washington Still-life and it has recently been suggested that the Washington painting, usually attributed to Pensionante del Saraceni, is by a different artist, who also contributed the still-life to this picture.The hard, crisp quality of the outlines of the figures, and the modelling in light, are close to the works of Dutch and Flemish Caravaggesque painters

17491-01virgin.jpg	The Virgin and Child with musical angels was a popular theme in late fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century Bruges. It was developed over the decades through numerous examples by Memling, David, and their followers. Such examples invariably showed youthful angels, however, rather than putti, which were far more common in North Italian painting of the period. Mantegna's San Zeno Altarpiece, or another example of its type which Gossart had seen during his Italian sojourn in 1508-09 may well have provided Gossart with a precedent for the close pose and placement of the putti at the base of the Virgin's throne.An unusual feature of the painting is that the Virgin's head was apparently left blank and has been repainted several times. The present head is a modern restoration

00907-armadio1.jpg	This panel is part of a series, now consisting of thirty-five panels, commissioned by Piero de Medici for the doors of a cupboard at the San Marco convent, and depicting scenes from the life of Christ.In this, the first panel, the prophet Ezekiel and St Gregory the Great sit in a mountainous landscape with the river Chobar running between them. In the top left of the panel is a text from the first book of Ezekiel outlining the prophet's vision, which is shown below. Ezekiel leans back, his hands raised in surprise. His vision included four animalia who, 'had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel', (Ezekiel 1, v. 16). It is this wheel within a wheel which is shown here with a flaming circumference. Angelico depicts the wheel as being made of two concentric circles. Around the larger wheel is the account of the creation from Genesis, and around the smaller the first three verses of the Gospel of St. John, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the word was God ...', which echo the words from Genesis.At the top right of the picture is an excerpt from the writings of St Gregory, who interpreted the prophet's vision and used it to emphasize parallels between the Old and New Testaments.

One of these was the Christ on the Cross, painted for the Marshal de Noailles and his wife, Catherine Fran�oise Charlotte de Cosse-Brissac. Formerly a highly placed courtier with King Louis XV, and a military commander in the War of the Austrian Succession, Noailles was created a marshal of France in 1775, but had little influence at the court of the new king Louis XVI. Both he and his wife were devoutly religious.

32646-2mercury.jpg	The small group categorized as Pre-Rembrandtists includes Pieter Lastman (c. 1583-1633), Jan Pynas (1581/2-1631) and his younger brother Jacob (1592/95-after 1656), their brother-in-law Jan Tengnagel (1584-1635), Lastman's brother-in-law Fran�ois Venant (1590/91-1636), and Claes Moeyaert (1590/91-1655).The Pynas brothers are known to have signed their works 'J. Pynas' or with a monogram and this has not simplified the problem of separating their hands. History paintings by Jacob Pynas are of two types: dynamic compositions with large Lastman-like figures and works that appear at first blush to be landscapes until one discovers small biblical or mythological scenes in them. The latter works carry on the traditions of Elsheimer and Bril

31765-hagar_de.jpg	This painting depicts Hagar in the desert comforted by an angel.Hagar, the Egyptian hand maiden of Sarah was the mother of Ishmael, Abraham's first son. When Isaac, Sarah's son, was born Ishmael mocked his younger brother so that Sarah asked Abraham to banish him, together with his mother. Abraham provided them with bread and a bottle of water and sent them off into the desert of Beersheba. When the water was spent Hagar put Ishmael under a bush to die and then sat some way off, weeping. But an angel appeared, by tradition the archangel Michael, and disclosed a well of water near by, so they were both saved.

12367-2healing.jpg	"Around 1660 Karel Dujardin, known for his Italianate landscapes also started to paint large biblical scenes in a smooth, elegant and colourful style. St Paul Healing the Cripple at Lystra is an impressive example of history painting in classicist style.The apostle Paul is the central figure in the composition. He towers over a crowd of sick and kneeling people. The scene depicted here is taken from the story of Paul, who had fled with Barnabas to Lystra - in present-day southern Turkey - (Acts 14:9-10). When Paul was preaching in Lystra, among those listening to him was a man who had been a cripple since birth. Paul 'saw that he had the faith to be cured, so he said to him in a loud voice, ""stand up straight on your feet""; and he sprang up and started to walk'. After this miraculous cure, the crowd took Paul and Barnabas to be heathen gods, and the people even wanted to make sacrifices to them. Appalled, the Christian apostles shouted that they were not gods and begged the people not to offer them sacrifices. In desperation they tore their own clothes. This last event was often depicted in the 17th century, but Karel Dujardin chose a more original moment.The apostle Paul was painted from a a low viewpoint, his form looming against the cloudy sky. He stands in an elegant pose, with his weight on his left leg as he gestures expansively with his arms. Paul, dressed in a brown robe and a bright red cloak, looks at the cripple beside him. The strong red is balanced by the bright blue of their clothes worn by the women on the left. The woman in the foreground on the right, with her immaculate white headdress, is also striking. She grasps the hem of Paul's cloak in her hand in the hope of receiving some of his power.The needy people standing behind Paul look not at him but at the point where Barnabas once stood. Dujardin had originally portrayed Barnabas behind Paul, but later - for reasons unknown - removed him from the picture.The faint outlines of Barnabas' head are still dimly visible"

10988-212david.jpg	In the first period of the Revolution, David continued to paint portraits of the cultivated upper classes and aristocracy. In 1790 he had painted the Marquise d'Orvilliers and the Countess de Sorcy, and around this time he also painted Madame Adelaide Pastoret, who, although of the upper class, is shown as a wife and mother without display of finery. The politics of the day called for homely virtues to be emphasized and any display of rank or status would have been considered suspect. Like so many of David's paintings of the Revolution, this work was not finished, as we can see from the incomplete quickly brushed shimmering background (frottis) and the absence of a sewing needle in Madame's hand. In all probability there was a split between the Pastorets and David over the latter's increasingly extreme politics, which meant that the portrait was left in its present state

18107-3visita.jpg	Two monumental shrines, of proportions similar to those of true chapels were frescoed by Benozzo Gozzoli at Castelfiorentino, on the initiative of a single client, Ser Grazia di Francesco, prior of Santa Maria at Castelnuovo Val d'Elsa: the Shrine of the Madonna della Tosse, and the Shrine of the Visitation. Among the assistants who were given the job of translating the master's ideas into painting was probably his son Francesco.The Shrine of the Visitation was located on Via Volterrana in Castelfiorentino, on a piece of land belonging to the Minorite nunnery of Santa Maria. Painted on the outside as well as the inside, it was exposed to the elements until 1872 when it was enclosed in a small chapel, but without repairing the damage caused by the flooding of the Elsa. It proved necessary in 1970 to detach the paintings which can now be seen in the Biblioteca Comunale of Castelfiorentino. A lost inscription, known to us from a document from 1632 citing it, mentioned Benozzo and his sons Francesco and Alesso as the authors and gave the date as February 12, 1491.The pictorial ornamentation of the shrine has the consistency of an imposing mural cycle, divided into rows. On the altar wall there was an altarpiece depicting the Madonna and Saints. (All that remains is the upper part of the sinopia found during the detachment of the frescoes.) The arched vault, which has the Annunciation on the outside, bears the images of Christ Giving His Blessing and , underneath, the Evangelists and the Doctors of Church. They are followed, on the outside and inside, scenes from the life of Joachim, Anne, and Mary, some of which have been almost entirely destroyed.Although much of the execution was entitled to his sons and assistants, the inventions and design of the shrine clearly bear the stamp of Benozzo Gozzoli

44146-witches.jpg	Of the dozen or so known paintings ascribed to Wijnen, an unusual proportion depict scenes of the supernatural and of witchcraft, often by moonlight; such themes popularised by the works of Salvator Rosa, whose engravings were widely admired during the second half of the 17th century.The present painting juxtaposes real and supernatural characters in a nocturnal scene taking place on the outskirts of a village. At the left of the composition, a woman accompanies an adolescent, who seems unable to see her. She holds a book in one hand and a stick in the other. A lion, symbol of courage, stands next to her naked feet. This woman likely represents an allegory of power, thus characterising youth. The rest of the composition contains an ensemble of elements clearly pertaining to the world of sorcery. Indeed, death and love are in question here. Evil spirits, a demon holding a mirror off to the right, and the Devil, in the form of an old woman on a goat that dominates the scene, all feature. A pact has seemingly been made with the Devil: the protagonist has sold his soul for eternity, in exchange for a temporary allocation of his power. The central scene represents, in all probability, the Devil himself who comes to claim the soul of the hanged man, which passes through a ring - symbol of eternity - placed above the gallows.Other elements holding traces of sorcery are represented here: the fire in the centre of the scene, a symbol of physical, moral and mystical transmutation. Close to the fire we find a cat, servant of the underworld, as well as a sleeping baby, often victims of sorcery.

44415-view1.jpg	A master of subtle chiaroscuro, Joseph Wright of Derby is one of the most important of the late eighteenth-century artists who define the British Romantic movement. Painted in 1780, and exhibited at the Royal Academy that year, this painting is one of a distinguished group of works inspired by the artist's travels in Italy, and demonstrates the profound impact which that experience had on his art.In the autumn 1774 Wright travelled to Naples and the area around the gulf of Salerno, a popular destination for the cognoscenti of his generation, and over the course of more than a month visited Pompeii, Herculaneum and the Museum at Naples, as well as Virgil's tomb and the coastal grottos for which that region is famed. This picture is evolved from a chalk drawing Wright made on the spot in the Gulf of Salerno, one of two studiously observed and minutely detailed sketches of particular caverns which clearly captured the artist's imagination.The painting shows a grotto in the Gulf of Salerno, with the figure of Julia, banished from Rome. Three errant Julias were banished from Rome during classical antiquity, all for adultery, all within about a forty year period during the 1st century BC, and all to virtually inaccessible islands. The title given to this picture at the 1780 Royal Academy exhibition leaves it ambiguous as to which of these three she is meant to be. The best known of three possible candidates, Julia, the only child of Emperor Augustus and his wife Scribonia, was the wife of the great Roman general Agrippa

00855-annunci.jpg	This fresco is situated on the wall of the northern corridor on the upper floor in front of the staircase in the Convento di San Marco in Florence. It was painted on Angelico's return from Rome in 1450, and is therefore several years later than the majority of the frescoes at San Marco. In style it falls between the sparseness of The Annunciation in cell 3 and the richness of the Cortona altarpiece. Unlike in the Cortona version, the garden is here viewed through a colonnade of columns which recede to a vanishing point near the centre of the painting.Under the arches between the Corinthian columns are the slender figures of the Madonna and of the angel in devout converse, regulated with the rhythm of gentle curves; in the background, on the left, the celestial fields with Tuscan cypresses; Gabriel's wings stretch out like a rainbow. It is the theme of the tabernacles which multiply themselves at the crossing of the ways; the greeting taken from the mediaeval hymnology and the invitation addressed to the passer-by and writings under the painting show Angelico's most cultivated devotion: Salve, Mater pietatis / et totius Trinitatis / nobile triclinium / Maria!The lighting of the scene is curiously illogical, the interior of the arcaded loggia is evenly illuminated, despite the fairly strong light coming from the left

32266-18arcadi.jpg	'Et in Arcadia ego' is a phrase coined by Virgil and used in 17th century Italy expressing, in an elliptical way, the humanistic sentiment: Even in Arcadia I (i.e. Death) am to be found. That is to say, even the escapist, pastoral world of Arcady is no refuge from death. The words feature in paintings from that time inscribed on  monumental stonework, especially a tomb, which stands in rural surroundings. The earliest representation of the theme by Guercino (Galleria Corsini, Rome) shows two shepherds coming unexpectedly upon a skull - the typical memento mori - that lies on a piece of fallen masonry bearing the words 'Et in Arcadia ego'.In the hands of Poussin who made two versions the sense was gradually modified. Shepherds are seen before a tomb deciphering the inscription with an air of melancholy curiosity. The skull is no longer significant or is omitted. The words now seem to imply an epitaph on the person - perhaps a shepherdess - who lies entombed: 'I too once lived in Arcady', an alteration to the meaning that somewhat stretches the grammar of the original Latin.In this version all sense of surprise has been removed, and instead, the shepherds are arranged in attitudes of contemplation round the tomb in the countryside. The artist has lost all interest in story-telling, and has concentrated on a totally static scene. No pleasure is taken in surface texture, and the whole is hard and cold, with the figures in statuesque poses.The other, less severe version of the subject by Poussin is at Chatsworth

35366-04religi.jpg	At the end of 1605 Rubens settled in Rome. Of great significance were his commissions for the Oratorians, who were, with the Jesuits, one of the most important new orders of the Counter-Reformation. In these altarpieces of Rubens's later period there is a strong affinity with the work of Correggio, another painter of the High Renaissance, who exercised an important influence on the emergence of the Baroque style through his softer modelling and his emotionally charged expressively. That was particularly the case in contemporary Rome, where the style of the leading painters such as Federico Barocci and Annibale Carracci was based in part on Correggio.The Ecstasy of St Gregory the Great was commissioned for the high-altar painting of the Oratorians' main church, Santa Maria Vallicella. The compositional structure and the emotionally charged facial expressions and details in movement in Rubens's first 'modello' for this altarpiece (Staatliche Museen, Berlin) is inspired by similar altar compositions by Correggio. In the definitive version the construction, influenced by Raphael and antique sculpture, is stronger and more classicist. This painting is without doubt the zenith of the artistic output of Rubens's Italian years. This majestic veneration of the saints is also one of the most manifest expressions of Counter-Reformation triumphalism in the city of its birth.Rubens considered this commission as the confirmation of his reputation as a painter in Rome. Yet the picture was not hung in the place for which it was intended, because it reflected the light entering the church too strongly. For this reason the canvas was replaced by a new version on slate. This was quite different from the first painting; its composition was divided over three separate panels. This work, still in its original place in Santa Maria Vallicella, was ready in autumn 1608. Immediately afterwards Rubens returned to Antwerp. He took the rejected canvas with him and placed it above the tomb of his mother, Maria Pijpelinckx, who had died while he was on his way home.

39444-5parad1.jpg	Major fires in the Doge's Palace in 1574 and 1577 necessitated the wholesale renovation of its pictorial decoration, and artists received explicit instructions about subject and even composition, the idea being to emulate the visual authority of the destroyed works as closely as possible. Tintoretto painted several large ceiling panels for the elaborate program, which emphasized Venice's military achievements, celebrated the city's unique form of government, touted civic freedom, and claimed Venice's parity with the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire.Tintoretto's most important contribution to the enterprise was the replacement of Guariento's 1365 Coronation of the Virgin, located behind the dais on which the doge and leading patricians sat during meetings of the Great Council. It had been decided that the replacement would continue to centre around Christ and Mary, preserving the general paradisiacal theme of Guariento's composition. However, the focus of Tintoretto's Paradise composition was to be Christ rather than Mary, eliminating the flanking scenes of the Annunciation and setting Christ as the supreme authority, to whom Mary is subsidiary. The seething crowds of saints and angels purposefully suggest a Last Judgment, reminding Great Council members of the gravity and enduring significance of their deliberations and actions

21121-christ_h.jpg	Nicolaus Kn�pfer is considered by art historians to be one of the nonconformist eccentrics. It is only one manifestation of his eccentricity that he enjoyed reaching for rarely depicted themes including some that could be found in the New Testament. This can be seen in his painting Christ before Herod Antipas, an episode that occurs only in the Gospel of St Luke. The wall with the low door, closing off the space, looks like a stage set. The curtains and the stage raised by three steps on the right and extending to the plane of the painting are theatrical. The king, leaning back on his throne, is shrieking with laughter and the soldier on one knee, dressing Jesus in a white mantle, has his back to us. His hulking comrade, leaning on his stave, calls through the door to recruit more spectators for Jesus' derision

18212-0305grec.jpg	El Greco arrived in Rome in 1570 and he was recommended by Giulio Clovio to his patron Cardinal Alessandro Farnese as a portrait painter. His portraiture developed dramatically during  his Roman sojourn, reaching a peak in his portrait of Vincenzo Anastagi. The sitter was a distinguished Knight of Malta, who had been appointed 'sergente maggiore' of Castel Sant'Angelo in 1575. The portrait was probably painted to commemorate the appointment. For El Greco it was an important challenge, for he seems never previously to have painted a full-length or military or official portrait.The armour, sword, helmet, the green baldric and velvet breeches ornamented with gold thread, are the attributes of his station. Yet El Greco has not confined himself to replicating these particulars. He has sought to make manifest Anastagi's body politic as well - in particular the cardinal virtue of fortitude, comprising courage, endurance and physical strength.In spite of the qualities of the portrait, the paucity of the extant and recorded portraits which El Greco painted in Rome suggests that commissions were not forthcoming, probably because his Titianesque technique was not appreciated

26108-30young.jpg	This portrait is a typical example of the genre and its stage of development within late 15th-century Netherlandish painting. While the variegated marble pillar in the background indicates a rather grander setting than, for example, the architecture of Robert Campin, the location in fact plays only a secondary role. Perspective details are lacking, and the distance between the front edge of the picture and the parapet draped with the carpet behind appears to be extremely short. The half length figure of the genteel young man is correspondingly lacking in physical depth; although seen in a three-quarter view which incorporates the room beyond, the positioning of his hands and the elements of his costume convert three-dimensional space into two-dimensional plane. In place of powerful sculptural volumes and a balancing of horizontal and vertical values, we find here an emphasis upon the perpendicular and a precise observation of detail, both in the figure and the clothing, as evidenced by the differentiated modelling of the eyes, the sensitive, slightly asymmetrical drawing of the lips, and above all by the almost photographic rendering of the fingers. Memling displays the same painstaking care in his treatment of the richly trimmed sleeves.In providing a glimpse of landscape in the right-hand corner, Memling obeys a convention which was common in early Renaissance portraiture and which would remain popular even into the 16th-century. In keeping our view into the outdoors narrow, he neither distracts our attention from the sitter nor influences the mood of the scene.The panel is the left wing of a triptych. We have to assume that the young man is worshipping a holy figure, probably a Virgin and Child, located in the middle of the loggia. In view of his position on the left, there must have been a young woman in the right wing of what will have been a folding devotional triptych with matching panels of the classic type.On the back of the a panel a still-life can be found

03282-panel1.jpg	This small panel was one of a polyptych from the life of the Virgin. It was a commission granted to Bartolo di Fredi by the Company of Saint Peter on May 9, 1585, for the Chapel of the Annunciation in the Church of S. Francesco in Montalcino, where the artist had already painted other works. The polyptych has since been broken up, and parts of it can be seen in various museums. This panel depicts the Nativity and the Adoration of the Shepherds as well as an occasion that took place before these events, when an angel announced the divine birth to the shepherds.The Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph are in a cave with the swaddled infant lying in a manger. Behind the Madonna are an ox and an ass, and the shepherds kneel in the front. On the right side, on a much smaller scale, is the angel's annunciation to the shepherds. One shepherd covers his face with one hand, thus showing his surprise and fear, whereas the other hand is holding a bagpipe, an obvious reference to pagan bucolic scenes. The angel bringing the news is holding an olive branch, the symbol of peace and celebration. In the upper portion of the painting, angels have emerged halfway out of a cloud and form a semicircle; they are in the act of singing.As a sign of devotion, the Virgin Mary is represented in a larger scale than the other figures; above the infant are a dove and a star, which serve to illuminate him almost as if they formed the symbolical representation of the Trinity.

12955-1virgin.jpg	There exists an earlier painting (possibly dating from 1838) of the same subject in the Tate Gallery, London, and a variant of the present design in the Castle Museum, Nottingham. The latter, which is on slate, was made in preparation for the present picture. All three paintings have compositional affinities with Raphael, particularly works such as the Madonna del Granduca, the Madonna Tempi and the large Cowper Madonna. Dyce made a number of preparatory studies for the Virgin and Child and in a surprisingly wide variety of media - drawings, watercolours, oil and apparently even fresco, although this last item may be the painting on slate in Nottingham.The painting in the Royal Collection was acquired by Prince Albert in 1845. The pleasure that the Virgin and Child gave to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert resulted in the commission a year later of Saint Joseph to form a pair. This was finished in 1847 and was thought by Prince Albert to be finer than the Virgin and Child. Both pictures were hung after Prince Albert's death in the Queen's Bedroom at Osborne House, Isle of Wight. The queen herself made a copy in pastel of the Virgin and Child.The Virgin and Child and Saint Joseph are both works that in their simplicity of design, purity of outline and restricted colour are comparable with paintings by Overbeck and Schnorr von Carolsfeld

12302-2crevola.jpg	The Crevole Madonna and the Madonna of Buonconvento are unanimously considered the earliest works attributable to Duccio. The basic approach of the two paintings is of evident Byzantine tradition: the elegant stylisation of the hands, the typical downward curving nose, the red maph�rion under Mary's veil, the dark drapery animated by shining gilded lines. New details appear, to a lesser extent in the Buonconvento Madonna and repeated with greater confidence in the Crevole painting, such as the subtle play of light on the Virgin's face, over her chin and cheeks, and a clear attempt at plasticism in the folds of the garment around the face.The more carefully considered composition of the Crevole Madonna shows a faint but decided French influence: the elegant forms of the angels in the upper corners, the veiled transparency of the Child's garment, held up by a curious knotted cord, and most of all, the intimate gesture of the Infant Jesus, held in a tender embrace

19845-11venus.jpg	Sitting in front of a green curtain and behind a low parapet, Venus, the Roman goddess of love, addresses the viewer with an open gesture and frank gaze. On her lap is the small, naked figure of Amor, who, holding love's arrow in his hand, is endeavouring to clamber on to the parapet.It is not known who commissioned this picture, which is the earliest of Holbein's mythological paintings; it is first mentioned as being in the possession of Basilius Amerbach, who obtained it in 1578 as a present from his cousin, Franz Rechburger. In his inventory, Amerbach notes that the panels with Venus and La&#239;s are in fact portraits of a woman from the Offenburg family. However, even if Holbein did make use of a portrait study, he has idealized his model to the point where it can no longer be considered a true portrait.

11207-1890s_02.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries.Degas was forever inventing new ways of seeing and devising new approaches to his models.

19753-roaddyke.jpg	Meindert Hobbema was born in Amsterdam and was a pupil there of the landscape painter Jacob van Ruisdael. Ruisdael had moved to Amsterdam from his native Haarlem by 1657 and Hobbema must have entered his studio shortly thereafter. Hobbema's technique in the depiction of landscape and his choice of forest scenes are derived from his master, but Hobbema's landscapes do not possess the grandeur or the threatening and even melancholy aspect of Ruisdael's. Hobbema's is a reassuringly docile vision of landscape, a town-dweller's account of the beauty of the countryside. It is an essentially decorative view, an anticipation of the rococo landscapes of the eighteenth century.The Road on a Dyke shows him placing themes taken from Ruisdael - the pool surrounded by trees, the large over-arching oak dominating the landscape; the country path rutted by the wheels of waggons - in an open, sunlit landscape. The figures and cattle in the right foreground are probably by Adriaen van de Velde, who often collaborated with Hobbema and other landscape painters.Hobbema's career is a reminder of how precarious a living was to be made from painting in Holland in the seventeenth century. In 1668 Hobbema was appointed to the post of wine-gauger to the Amsterdam guild of wine-importers, through his marriage to the maidservant of a burgomaster in Amsterdam. Although by no means an exalted position, the job did at least guarantee a regular income, and Hobbema almost gave up painting entirely: However, it was during these years that he produced some of his finest works, including The Avenue at Middelharnis, painted in 1689

03446-15adorat.jpg	The contrast between light and dark is almost obsessive in all Bassano's later oeuvre, along with a Titianesque nonfinished effect. This is evident in the Adoration of the Shepherds in San Giorgio Maggiore, since the theme was traditionally one that lent itself to the quest for symbolic enlightenment. When he tackled this last, prestigious and unexpected commission, complicated by the need to adapt a normally horizontal subject to the dimensions of a tall, narrow altarpiece, the aging Jacopo avoided to fill up the spaces with his usual repertoire of objects and animals. Instead, he invented an empty, rarified, interrogative atmosphere, resolving his structural problems with a three-level hierarchy of lighting. Low down, he swathes the now revealed and adored Child in divine light, in the Flemish style; halfway up, the shepherd with the torch provides a superfluous source of natural light; and at the top, the dark is rent by a narrow, angelic glory and a final shaft of supernatural light that filters weakly across the countryside and lopsided shelter

39826-4paul3.jpg	According to Vasari this painting was commissioned by the Farnese family in 1546. Titian arrived to Rome in 1545 and he met there several cardinals and artists and he was even received by Pope Paul III.A few decades earlier, Pope Leo X (1475-1521), who was a great patron of Pope Paul III, was also portrayed by Raphael with two of his relatives, his nephews Giulio de' Medici and Luigi de Rossi. Giulio later became Pope Clement VII. The political allusion to this painting is clear in Paul III's decision to be portrayed with two of his younger relatives. In terms of composition, though, Titian is scarcely influenced by Raphael. He finds his own subtle means of expressing the political claims of Paul III.Titian shows the old, stooped pope grasping the armrest with his left hand, and he gives the pontiff a wily expression quite at odds with the conventions of state portraiture. The free movement of the models - quite unusual in contemporary portrait paintings - contributes to the extraordinary qualities of this group portrait

29755-s_musici.jpg	Ochtervelt is best known for his genre pictures which received a strong impetus from the works of Frans van Mieris the Elder done in the late 1650s and early 1660s. He adopts and often refines Mieris's motifs. Mieris's sexual allusions are not missing, but they are less explicit. He gains distinction as a remarkable stuff painter and develops a personal palette of lovely salmon pinks, light blues, silvery greys, violets, and orange browns.After 1660 he concentrates on the high life of the wealthier classes and the domestic life of affluent women, their children, servants. His highly original contribution in his domestic scenes is the perfection of the entrance hall motif. In them he focuses on the open door of a well-to-do home at which food vendors or begging musicians appear. In Ochtervelt's hands the threshold device creates three prominent distinctions: the differences between indoor and outdoor light and space; the separation of private and public spheres of life; the differentiation of social classes. His vendors and beggars are well-kempt and jolly; they seem to live in a world where the misery of poverty has never been experienced. They hardly could differ more from the wretched ones Rembrandt depicted in his etchings earlier in the century.As seen in this picture, in the sixties Ochtervelt's figures become slender and attenuated reflecting a new ideal of beauty. About the same time Jan Steen begins to use a similar canon of proportion for the fine women in his genre pieces. What soon became recognized as an elegant thinness, an earlier generation would have called skinny

07576-48palaf.jpg	The present Madonna with the Serpent is generally called Madonna dei Palafrenieri.It was in late 1605 that Caravaggio finally obtained a commission for St Peter's. The papal grooms or palafrenieri invited him to paint an altarpiece for them, and in April 1606 it was exhibited in the basilica for a few days before being moved to the grooms' church of Sant'Anna nearby. If the sympathy of Paul V had facilitated the commission, his nephew soon profited by it, for later in the year, just after the painter had left Rome for good, it was added to the Borghese collection.Under the watchful gaze of St Anne, Jesus's apocryphal grandmother, Mary helps a naked Christ Child to tread on a snake. The snake may be interpreted as Satan and indirectly as heresy, for Mary and Jesus are free of sin and its consequences, Mary as a virgin mother and by reason of her Immaculate Conception, Jesus as God made man - and they combine to crush the serpent under their feet.This large iconographic canvas has a certain humanity thanks to Mary's naturalness and the lack of inhibition with which Caravaggio depicts Christ naked (a fact that gave offence to some connoisseurs at the time, according to Bellori). Though their haloes are aligned, a dark gulf separates the pretty Mary from her ugly mother; and if the palafrenieri were willing to let Cardinal Scipione Borghese buy the picture so soon after they had received it and paid for it, it may have been because they disliked the unflattering depiction of their patroness

36792-edward6a.jpg	Guillaume Scrots, as court painter to Henry VIII's son and successor, Edward VI, was responsible for the design of the most important official portrait of Edward as king, of which the present painting is one of the rare extant examples. This full length portrait of Edward depicts the young king at about the age of fifteen and not long before his untimely death from consumption in 1553.Edward VI (1537-1553) was the only son of King Henry VIII, by his third wife, Jane Seymour, and just nine years old when he succeeded to the throne. As he matured, Edward developed a deep interest in religious policy and his reign, although brief, is important as it marked a continuation and consolidation of the English Reformation, something which his sister Mary, who succeeded him as Queen of England, was unable to reverse.

12311-6perugi.jpg	"The Perugia Madonna, now in the local National Gallery, was kept perhaps ab antiquo up until 1863 in the monastery of San Domenico in Perugia, hung above the sacristy door or in the ""Winter Choir"". It was ascribed to Duccio in 1911 and subsequent restoration revealed it to be the central panel of a dismantled polyptych.The formal stylistic elements of the traditional half-length portrait of the Madonna and Child develop into the portrayal of a solid mother and son relationship, showing a greater naturalness of gesture. Remarkable spontaneity is shown in the movement of the Child who is sitting on his mother's curved arm, clutching the soft folds of her veil. This detail in dress is of importance since it takes the place of the red Byzantine maph�rion, evidently considered old-fashioned by the painter. The Virgin's gesture, showing the Child's hand and pointing to his feet, is also significant: it seems to allude to the future Passion of Christ.The original splendour of the painting is marred by its poor state of preservation, but although of high pictorial value it had no influence on local artistic production"

11691-1madonna.jpg	"The painting is known as the Carnesecchi Tabernacle.Domenico Veneziano stayed in Florence around 1432; here he began to work as an independent artist, painting his first works between 1432 and 1437, the year he moved to Perugia to paint, as Vasari informs us, ""a room in the house of the Baglioni family with frescoes that have been destroyed."" The first painting Domenico worked on in Florence was the Carnesecchi Tabernacle, today in the National Gallery, London.The painting shows a dignified and aristocratic Madonna seated on an elegant throne decorated with splendid marble intarsia; the Child is standing on her lap. The elaborate and accurate perspective construction of the throne, to some extent influenced by Paolo Uccello, is also indicative of another aspect of Domenico's style, his interest in the rules of perspective, for his art belongs entirely to the new language of the Renaissance.The choice of colours in the London painting is extraordinary: the delicate tones are emphasized by the bright and uniform lighting, widely praised by all art historians as one of the most truly original elements in Domenico's work"

40134-port_wom.jpg	For the composition of this portrait Traut followed a model developed by D�rer. The woman, depicted bust-length, is set against a green background onto which her shadow is projected. She wears fashionable dress, while the large chain around her neck and the group of rings on her index finger indicate her elevated social status. Traut defined her body through large areas of colour but without strong modelling. His principal area of interest was, however, the face, which is realistically painted and constructed in detail, unlike the neck and bust.

07406-bosco.jpg	Returning to Bologna from Rome, Canuti was entrusted with a series of fresco commissions in the monastery San Michele in Bosco, where he served as abbot. There Canuti distinguished himself as one of Bologna's most modern painters of the period, producing animated compositions with spectacular perspective, notably the fall of the angels on the face of the church's triumphal arch.The new church type, developed in the Baroque period, offered large format vertical picture surfaces on the inner fa�ade and on the dividing wall between the nave and the choir, which were used both for oil paintings and for frescoes. Canuti's painting on the triumphal arch wall is an example of fresco decoration.

24381-deluge.jpg	John Martin had humble beginnings in Newcastle-upon-Tyne as a herald painter to a coach-builder, and then in London as a painter on china and glass, but he later achieved a great success with his highly imaginative paintings of scenes from a variety of literary sources, particularly the Old Testament. Many of these pictures were executed on a vast scale and were frequently visionary in conception. The impact of Martin's paintings was also enhanced by his use of vivid contrasts in colour, which served to emphasise the grandeur and other-worldliness of his compositions, and the varying thickness of the paint surface. Apart from his paintings Martin was also a prolific illustrator and engraver, as well as a practising urban engineer.It was while Prince Albert was visiting Martin's studio that he saw one of the artist's major works, The Deluge (the second version of 1834, present whereabouts unknown), and suggested that the artist paint the related themes - The Eve of the Deluge and The Assuaging of the Waters - in order to make a series. It would seem, however, that the artist himself had already developed the idea for such a sequence.The subject of The Eve of the Deluge is ultimately based on Genesis 6:5-8, in which God despairs of man's wickedness on earth and decides to destroy him with the single exception of Noah. The figures on the promontory in the foreground are the patriarchs. The seated figure with a white beard is Methuselah, who is surrounded by the family of Noah. Methuselah instructs Noah to open the scroll written by his father, Enoch, so that he can compare the signs in the sky (sun, moon and comet) with those on the scroll. The fact that they match ordains the end of the world and this results in Methuselah's death. The figures hurrying up the slope include those described in the Bible as 'giants in the earth in those days'. In the middle distance, under the trees on the right, is a group of revellers representing the antediluvian age. Their behaviour has no doubt undermined God's confidence in man. Ravens, a symbol of ill omen, circle overhead. The ark, which Noah was instructed to build in order to save himself, his family and the animals, is visible on a distant promontory in the background on the right.Both The Eve of the Deluge and The Assuaging of the Waters were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1840, and The Eve of the Deluge was acquired by Prince Albert the following year. The Assuaging of the Waters is now in San Francisco Museum of Fine Arts.Martin published his own account of these three paintings in a pamphlet entitled The Deluge of 1840. This shows that his sources were fairly recondite, extending beyond the historical and the religious to the cosmological and the eschatological, including Byron's Heaven and Earth. 'Altogether the three paintings amount to a history of the world, summarized in the terms of documentary mythology and dioramic episodes, compressed into three scenes - evening, midnight and daybreak.

00647-caiano0.jpg	"The twenty-five-year old Ottaviano de' Medici, on behalf of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici and his cousin Pope Leo X, commissioned Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio and Pontormo for decorations celebrating the pope's father, Lorenzo the Magnificent, and other family members inside the family's villa at Poggio a Caiano. The iconographical programme, designed by the historian Paolo Giovio, aimed to evoke the celebrations of the Medici house through a series of episodes drawn from Roman history.Work in the Salone was halted with the death of Leo X in December 1521. Pontormo was the only one to have finished his lunette fresco, frescoes by Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto on the long walls were partially incomplete. The decoration was completed by Alessandro Allori in 1578-82, a commission of Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici.The Triumph of Caesar is located on one of the long walls of the Salone. It presents an interlocking of Roman and Medicean history such as the return of Cosimo de' Medici from exile in 1434 or the donation of the Sultan of Egypt to the Florentines in 1487 of a menagerie of exotic animals. The figure in a red toga and blue cloak sitting on a marble throne is clearly identified as Caesar by his laurel wreath. Several older men are standing or kneeling before him, pointing to the men bearing animals and vases at the left edge of the painting.This fresco, no less than the other frescoes in the main hall of the Villa Medici at Poggio a Caiano, is brilliantly sensitive to its setting, which accounts for the angle and height of viewing and the open lighting.In 1582 Alessandro Allori added several details to the right-hand part of the picture. The original edge of the frame ran immediately behind the figure of Caesar, and his elbow extended over the frame. The parts to the right of that and the putto were added by Allori, who signed the fresco under the putto: ""Anno Domini MDXXI Andreas Sartius pingebat et A.D. MDLXXXII Alexander Allorius sequebatur."

Following the restlessness of his youthful period, this painting represents a moment of moderation, in which the references to the examples of Fra Bartolomeo and Andrea del Sarto appear more evident. The painting was much admired by Vasari, especially for the ""vividness of the colours"", which, with the greater regularity of the composition and the poses of the single figures, reveal a more original quality and come closer to the eccentric use of colour in the previous works, especially in the St Catherine kneeling in the foreground.The unusually large assortment of saints comprises Sts Bernard, Augustine, Sebastian, Jacob, Joseph, Catherine, Peter, Anthony Abbot and two other unidentified male saints"

18473-indolenc.jpg	Greuze exhibited at the Salon of 1757 four pictures 'dans le costume italien', including Indolence or La Paresseuse Italienne. Here one might see the influence not only of Caravaggio but of Subleyras, notably in the beautiful response to tones of cream and white, set off by passages of warm colour, like the girl's scarlet shoes. Greuze's feel for textures is demonstrated in the range of material suggested: from the delicacy of glass to the coarse fabric of the skirt, not overlooking the pale yet sensuously heavy tones of flesh. A typically Greuzian fondness for the pleasures of disorder characterizes the whole composition. Not Italy but his own temperament seems the inspiration behind it

19469-stillobs.jpg	De Heem painted this still-life during his first Antwerp phase. Compositionally, it is close to the ornamental still-lifes by Abraham van Beyeren of the early 1650s, who was no doubt influenced by de Heem, especially with regard to the terraced arrangement of the fruit, the mussels, the tableware and the jug. Unlike van Beijeren, however, de Heem's art scintillates with bright colours and an unsurpassable  attention to detail. Influenced by the Jesuit artist Daniel Seghers, de Heem frequently incorporated hidden religious symbolism in his paintings. In this still-life, for example, the mussel and the lobster are allusions to the resurrection, and are related to the 'Eucharistic' grapes

24087-3sebast2.jpg	This large St Sebastian was intended as an altarpiece. recent research confirmed that it was originally hung in the Sainte Chapelle at Aigueperse, a castle in the Auvergne in France. It may have been executed for the marriage of Chiara Gonzaga and Gilbert de Bourbon-Monpensier in 1481.St Sebastian is standing like a piece of sculpture on a fragment of a building that looks like a pedestal, well above the archers whose heads are at the same level as that of the observer. Our gaze is drawn upwards towards the saint, whose eyes are also looking upwards to higher things.

32962-04impan.jpg	In the mid-1510s Raphael had passed from the highly synthetic and expressive compositions of the first years of the decade to representations which were more and more complex and even more dispersive. Most of these were also finished by his pupils, for this was the busiest moment in Raphael's career.The Madonna dell'Impannata in the Pitti Gallery in Florence was also painted with the help of assistants. According to some critics, the assistants executed the entire painting. But others see the master's hand at least in the major figures (some say in the Christ Child, some in St Elizabeth, some in both figures). The composition is innovative in respect to the usual iconography of the holy family. It shows St Catherine, St Elizabeth, Christ, the Virgin and St John gathered together in a group. A large tent is visible in the background and a window covered by linen (the impannata, or cloth covering of a window, which gives the painting its name) can be seen at the extreme right. Like many other works by Raphael, this painting was carried off by the French in 1799 and was not returned until after the Congress of Vienna, in 1815

28627-1vario02.jpg	After a few pictures painted in the 1860s, Monet dispensed almost entirely with figures in his works, devoting himself to landscape painting. However, when he did include large figures in his landscape paintings, as started to happen again in the 1880s, he treated them as if they were an element in the landscape. Around the mid-1880s, Monet reverted to the beginnings of his career as an artist and took up figure painting once more.In the two open air studies, Woman with a Parasol, Turned to the Left, and Woman with a Parasol, Turned to the Right, Monet was fascinated by the very low viewpoint from which the model is shown; she stands on a riverbank against a background of pale blue sky. The young woman in both pictures is Suzanne Hosched�, one of the daughters of Alice Hosched�, who was to become Monet's second wife in 1889. His future stepdaughter Suzanne was to be for a long time one of the painter's favourite models

39241-01adult1.jpg	"This painting was described by Ridolfi in 1642 in his biography of Tintoretto. Ridolfi writes that the picture ""is painted of the adulteress at the moment when Our Lord writes the letters in the dirt with his hand, and the Scribes and Pharisees depart, one after the other, concealing themselves among the columns of a portico that is represented with the most rare perspectival skill; and it is a picture filled with much erudition"". The pictorial erudition that so struck Ridolfi is demonstrated in the perspective structure, yet Tintoretto did not achieve this effortlessly: x-rays have revealed errors and redrawings in the lines of the architecture, above all in the patterning of the pavement. There is a strong centrifugal movement to the scene, and its quality of space extended by light seems to prefigure the artist's trilogy of paintings of the life of St Mark.In his painting of the encounter of Christ and the woman taken in adultery, Tintoretto provides a literal depiction of the biblical account (in John 8: 1 -11): the adulteress stands ""in the midst"" before Christ, who is seated in the temple preaching, and his disciples; on the right, the scribes and Pharisees are leaving the scene of their defeat, ""beginning with the eldest, even unto the last."" Christ's judgment frees the woman from the power other accusers: ""He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.""The prevailing opinion of the critics places this painting in the years between 1545 and 1550. The painting belongs to a group of works of medium size and similar format which treat the theme of Christ and the woman taken in adultery in various ways. The best known of these, along with the canvas in Rome, is the version at the Rijskmuseum in Amsterdam. The attribution of this painting is contested. Recently it was proposed that the author of the Adulteress was Giovanni Galizzi (active 1543-1565), a follower of Tintoretto"

10217-3apollo1.jpg	Cranach, like his contemporary Albrecht D�rer, was a dominant figure in German Renaissance painting. The influence of both artists was pervasive, although Cranach had the advantage of outliving D�rer by as much as thirty years. At the start of his career he was active in Munich and Vienna, but in 1505 he became court painter to Duke Friedrich the Wise of Saxony. Cranach held this position under two successive Electors until 1547, and again from 1550 until his death. The court was based at Wittemberg until the Elector Johann Friedrich went into exile in Augsburg (1547-52). After his return the Elector preferred to live in Weimar. Cranach carried out a wide range of duties as court artist including the decoration of the palace, but he was granted a coat-of-arms in 1508 and became wealthy, holding public office several times. The mark or signature of a flying snake that occurs on this panel and many others was derived from his coat-of-arms. Cranach was also a prolific engraver and book illustrator with an interest in publishing, particularly in Reformation literature. He was a close friend of Martin Luther and his family, whose portraits he painted frequently, although, like many other artists in Germany during these years, he retained Catholic patrons such as Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, Elector of Mainz.The subject of Apollo and Diana was treated on two other occasions by Cranach (Brussels, Mus�e des Beaux-Arts and Berlin, Gem&#228;ldegalerie). There are considerable differences between the three compositions, although in each case Apollo stands and Diana is seated on a stag. The painting in Brussels and the present work show Apollo about to shoot an arrow, whereas in the painting in Berlin (1530) he is without a quiver and merely holds three arrows in the same hand as the bow. The composition with Apollo aiming is comparable with the engraving by D�rer of about 1505, or with the print by Jacopo de' Barbari. The figure of Diana holding her right foot with one leg crossed over the other is reminiscent (although reversed) of the famous antique bronze known as the Spinario.The painting in the Royal Collection reveals all the main characteristics of Cranach's art. The tautness of the style, the fluency of the drawing of the nude, the love of greens and blues offsetting the lighter flesh tones, the detailed rendering of foliage and the carefully observed landscape replete with a perilously balanced castle on a distant crag and peaceful reflections in calm waters, these are the hallmarks of his finest works, and, it has to be admitted, also of his studio. The intensity of the style is matched by the studied care of the composition and by the clarity of the image.The painting is signed with the image of a winged serpent

There was the often told tragedy, van Gogh's abortive murderous attempt, when he slashed his own ear. Gauguin fled without ever seeing again his tempestuous friend, who was always to feel bitter about this.Gauguin painted the unflattering portrait of van Gogh during his stay at Arles. In this painting Gauguin has once again adopted the high viewpoint he had used in Still-Life with Three Puppies, which allows him to flatten the subject and treat it with the cloisonn� style he had formulated in Brittany with Bernard.

13426-poggio1.jpg	Of all the Medici villas in the environs of Florence, Poggio Imperiale has the most imposing site and is also closest to the Palazzo Pitti, which became the official residence of the grand dukes in 1561. The property came into the possession of Cosimo I de' Medici in 1565. From 1618 Maria Magdalena of Austria, the wife of Cosimo II de' Medici invested  a great sum on improvements made under the direction of Giulio Parigi. In 1624 the property was officially named Poggio Imperiale with reference to the grand duchess's imperial lineage. The lineage was also featured in the ambitious pictorial program of the public rooms and bedrooms which lay on the ground floor. However, the villa was stripped of its precious furnishings and art treasures from the seventeenth century under the Habsburg-Lorraine regency (1737-65).The decoration of Poggio Imperiale started again under the reign of Peter Leopold (1747-1792) who succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Tuscany when his eldest brother became emperor as Joseph II in 1765. This decoration was intended to set a new artistic direction and propagate new standards of taste: Neoclassicism.Three rooms in the south wing were frescoed in 1768-72 by Tommaso Gherardini and Giuliano Traballesi with the collaboration of Giuseppe del Moro, one of the best Tuscan perspective painters of the time. It was followed by the decoration of five rooms in the west wing in 1773-78. Here the frescoes were executed by Giuseppe Maria Terreni, Giuseppe Gricci, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini, and Tommaso Gherardini.The Segretaria del Granduca is the most important room of the grand duke's official rooms in the west wing. In this room the meetings between the sovereign and the secretaries who oversaw the business of government were held. The pictorial program of the decoration, executed by Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini, a pupil of Anton Raphael Mengs, is appropriate to that function.On the four walls of this modest-sized rectangular room, the young ruler Pietro Leopoldo's reform program is presented in the form of dignified mythological -allegorical overview of all aspects of life touched by the grand duke's good government. On the end wall opposite to the window, the personifications of Scientia, Pax, and Abundantia pose as three majestic women before a prospect that opens out to a view of a harbour in which a trading ship is being unloaded. The arts are solemnly evoked in the two larger wall paintings. On the left Apollo, Pegasus, and the nine Muses, furnished with their traditional attributes, are arranged in a barren landscape enlivened by a single tree. On the right-hand wall painting the personifications of the fine arts, with their titulary god Mercury are depicted. The panel on the fourth and narrowest wall is devoted to religion: a priest and a Roman matron stand next to an altar, performing a ritual offering. The ceiling painting represents the ruler's apotheosis: The Young Ruler is Presented to Tuscany by Athena.Images showing the decorations of the various rooms in the Villa Poggio Imperiale can be viewd on the respective pages of Tommaso Gherardini, Giuliano Traballesi, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Maria Terreni, and Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini

16852-crucifix.jpg	From the beginning of the 13th century the Berlinghieri, a family of painters (Berlinghiero and his sons Barone, Marco and Bonaventura), were working in Lucca. They were influenced by the new wave of Byzantinism which reached the peninsula after the capture of Constantinople by the crusaders. This courtly refined style had its first and greatest centre of expansion in Pisa. This was owing to the very strong links between this maritime republic and the East, and also to several remarkable artists such as Giunta Pisano, Enrico and Ugolini di Tedice and the anonymous painter now known as the Master of S. Martino. The element of pathos in the Byzantine style was given its most extreme expression in the crucifixes of Giunta. The one painted in 1236 (which is now lost) for Elias of Cortona, the founder of the basilica of S. Francesco at Assisi, was inspired, like all Giunta's other crucifixes, by the Eastern iconography of the 'Christus patient', that is the Brother of Man in His suffering. Under the influence of the Franciscans this interpretation was definitely substituted for the heroic Christ, impassive, triumphing over death.

26584-06_3ce6.jpg	"The fourth scene in the chronological order of the narrative, the Creation of Adam, is depicted in the large field of the vault of the sixth bay, between the triangular spandrels.Michelangelo's organization of the Sistine ceiling frescos represents perhaps the most complex composition in Western art. The space contains an intricate pseudo structure of architecture that frames the sculpture-like forms.  Out of the nine narrative scenes depicting events from Genesis, the most sublime scene is this ""Creation of Adam,"" in which his new vision of humanity attains pictural form.It is scarcely possible to put into words the impressions roused by this marvellous painting; it is as though current passed from the painted scene to the beholder, who often feels that he is assisting at a hallowed world-shaking event. Michelangelo experiences the stages of creation within himself, retracing the way to the divine source by the double path of religion and of art. Now that, inspired by God, he has given form to Eve, elliptical and parabolic shapes begin to multiply; the number of orbits with two focal points increase. These were copied blindly during the following two centuries and became a decorative commonplace.Precisely here, where man the microcosm and incarnate Word made in the divine image, the Adam Kadmon of Cabalistic doctrine, issues from the hand of God as the fingers of the Father and the son touch in a loving gesture, it is significant and convincing that the Eternal is circumscribed by the ellipse (symbolizing the 'cosmic egg') of his celestial mantle and angelic spirits, while Adam forms only an incomplete oval. Through the extended hands and arms the creative flash passes from one orbit to the other. Love radiates from the face of God and from the face of man. God wills his child to be no less than himself. As if to confirm this, a marvellous being looks out from among the host of spirits that bear the Father on their wings; a genius of love encircled by the left arm of the Creator. This figure has intrigued commentators from the beginning and has been variously interpreted as the uncreated Eve, or Sophia, divine wisdom. Be that as it may, this figure undoubtedly signifies beatific rapture"

35104-demons2.jpg	"The two paintings, A Friar Tempted by Demons and Anchorites Tempted by Demons, were acquired by the National Gallery with an attribution to Magnasco. This attribution was maintained by the Gallery until 1997, even though the quality of the paint surface and the brushstrokes - larger than the brief and nervous strokes of Magnasco - lead to questions about it. The discovery of the monogram signature ""SR"", made during a recent restoration, has enabled the attribution of the painting to Rosa.The theme of desert hermits is a recurring motif in Rosa's work during the first half of the 1660's. In 1661 he painted the altarpieces of St Paul the Hermit for the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Milan; while a 1662 letter from the artist to Giovanni Battista Ricciardi recounts how impressed he had been by seeing real hermitages in the wild landscape of the Apennine mountains during a trip to Loreto.In the backgrounds of the National Gallery's two oval canvases, savage nature devours the remains of classical buildings. In such pictures, Rosa anticipated the eighteenth century trend for pictures of ruins. Conversely, the later taste for such romantic expressions explains why Rosa's pictures were particularly prized by connoisseurs of the following centuries. Rosa's written satire Babylonia against the Court of Rome, composed in 1657-58, is a literary reflection of the same themes. The subject of the tormented monk also connects to the demon and witch pictures that appear in Rosa's work as early as the late 1640's when the artist, at the end of his Florentine sojourn, wrote the poem The Witch. Another recurring motif is the arched opening through which a luminous background is visible. The contrast between this background luminosity and foreground grimness has parallels in numerous works of Rosa, stretching back to the very beginning of his career (for example the Landscape with Waterfall at the Palazzo Pitti)"

12581-5empero1.jpg	Maximilian I of Austria (1459-1519) became head of the Habsburgs in 1493 and was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1508. He was a learned ruler with a strong interest in the arts. D�rer first met him during a visit to Nuremberg in 1512 and was commissioned to work on the gigantic woodcuts of The Triumphal Arch and The Triumphal Procession, as well as decorations for Maximilian's prayer book. In 1515 he was awarded an annual payment of 100 florins by the Emperor.On 28 June 1518 D�rer had sketched Maximilian during the Imperial Diet at Augsburg. He inscribed the drawing: `This is Emperor Maximilian, whom I, Albrecht D�rer, portrayed up in his small chamber in the tower at Augsburg on the Monday after the feast day of John the Baptist in the year 1518.' In the relatively informal sketch D�rer captured a hint of the fatigued resignation of the 59 year-old ruler.Maxmilian I died on 12 January 1519 and D�rer then used his drawing as the basis for a woodcut and two painted portraits, one in tempera (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg) and this one in oil. These finished works are formal portraits and lack some of the human character which comes out in the original sketch. In the oil portrait, the Emperor is dressed in an elegant fur, which D�rer has painted with great care. Instead of an orb, the Emperor holds a broken pomegranate, a symbol of the Resurrection and Maximilian's personal emblem. At the top of the picture is the Habsburg coat of arms with the double-headed eagle and a lengthy inscription on Maximilian's achievements. The Emperor looks aloof and withdrawn, an expression of his dignity

However, even the recognizable scenes are only loosely based on actual views.

24783-0merode.jpg	The subject of the altarpiece is the Annunciation. Unusually for this theme, the right wing depicts Joseph at work in his carpenter's shop. The Catholic Church has traditionally held that Joseph had six children by a previous marriage, and since at that time he was only Mary's fianc�, not her husband, the couple did not live together. This peculiar assemblage of subjects is therefore extremely rare, not to say unique, in the history of painting. The objects in Joseph's workshop are chosen so as to symbolically prefigure the Passion: the sword-shaped saw in the foreground alludes to the weapon that St Peter would use to cut off Malchus' ear while Christ was being arrested; the log that lies nearby recalls the wood of the cross; the stick propped against it, of the crown of thorns; nails, hammers, pliers and screwdrivers all prefigure the instruments of the Passion. The moustrap which Joseph is making may be a reference either to Christ's arrest (the mouse being associated, in popular tradition, with the soul) or to the Augustinian doctrine that the Virgin's marriage and Christ's Incarnation were planned by Providence as a trap in which to catch the devil, like a mouse lured by a bait.It is also possible, however, that this painting is not, in fact, an Annunciation. In the left wing, it is clear from the landscape visible behind the donor that it is springtime. The snow flakes falling in the small square that can be glimpsed through the window behind Joseph, on the other hand, suggest that it is winter. If both are true, then the triptych may well be intended to symbolize the time that passed between 25 March and 25 December, between Christ's conception and his birth. In which case, it would best be described as a Nativity

32217-22acis.jpg	Galatea is a Nereid, or sea-nymph, of Sicilian origin. Ovid (Met. 13:750-897) tells how she loved a handsome youth Acis and was herself loved by Polyphemus, a monstrous one-eyed giant, one of the race of Cyclops. The giant set on a promontory overlooking the sea and played a love song to Galatea on his pipes. Afterwards, wandering disconsolately among the rocks, he discovered her lying in the arms of Acis. The couple fled and Polyphemus in a rage flung a great boulder which killed Acis.

40005-2mouli01.jpg	The Moulin Rouge dance hall was opened on 5 October 1889, and was the meeting place of Paris society, artists and demi-monde. The red windmill at the entrance was a mock-up; its back consisted of various booths and a wooden elephant that could be turned into a stage. The venue was lit up as bright as day and decorated with mirrors, galleries and gaslights. In the middle was a large dance floor surrounded by a promenade, tables, and a garden.Between 1890 and 1896 the Moulin Rouge inspired Lautrec to no less than thirty paintings, which give us a better picture of the famous dance hall, its atmosphere and its clientele, than any photo-reportage could have achieved

37800-manett01.jpg	In 1348, (Gio)Vanni Manetti del Buono wrote instructions in his will that his chapel dedicated to John the Baptist (his name saint) in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence should be painted. The decoration of the chapel, situated to the right of the choir, consisted of six scenes from the life of St John the Baptist: the Annunciation to Zacharias; the Visitation; the Birth and Naming of John the Baptist; the Baptist preaching in the Desert and the Baptism; the Decollation and Burial of the Baptist; the Baptist visited in Prison by Two Apostles and the Feast of Herod.The present fresco is one of the twelve fragments to survive from a fresco cycle devoted to scenes from the life of St John the Baptist in the Manetti Chapel, identified on the basis of engravings made by Thomas Patch in 1772. The frescoes were already in poor condition in 1763-64 when they were restored. When the church of the Carmine was largely destroyed by fire in 1771, they suffered comparatively little. Patch made the engravings in 1772 and removed some fragments from the wall, the rest was presumably destroyed in the reconstruction of the church.The fragment, showing two haloed mourners, is from the scene of Decollation and Burial of the Baptist. By 1815 it was in the collection of Samuel Rogers, as shown in a mezzotint by Charles Mottram

43141-market.jpg	This painting was painted about 1650 but the style and manner of presentation are those of an earlier period. This was the beginning of the great period of middle-class genre painting when artists were developing a style quite different from Victor's over-familiar anecdotical approach.The market-place is in fact limited to the quack's table with an awning over it, and the group of simple people crowding round the stall. The church and houses round the market-square are outlined behind the group of onlookers and the village street with figures can be seen in the distance. The peasant sitting barefooted, one of his shoes discarded beside him, the charlatan in his finery, and the colourful company of villagers around them are characters in an anecdotical story which is indeed worthy of the painter's brush. Victors was a pupil of Rembrandt, and his figures are clearly derivative but they are smooth and superficial compared with the character studies of the great master

44742-miracle.jpg	According to an ancient tradition, on the night of August 4, 352, the Virgin Mary appeared on the Esquiline Hill in Rome to Pope Liberius (352-66) and a Roman nobleman by the name of John. Her message was that they were to build a church in the honour on the spot where in the morning they would find snow outlining the form the basilica was to take. The promised snow appeared, plans were drawn up, and the first major church in Rome in honour of Mary was erected. Its original title was S. Maria delle Neve (Our Lady of the Snow), also known as the Basilica Liberiana in honour of the pope, and later more commonly called Santa Maria Maggiore. Today this church ranks as one of the four major patriarchal basilicas of Rome.Jacopo Zucchi's painting commemorates the miracle of the establishment of the basilica

18199-0205grec.jpg	Probably soon after his arrival in Venice El Greco painted the Modena Triptych. Here he adapts Renaissance principles of representation to a small-scale triptych of a post-Byzantine design common in the Venetian empire. As the wings of the triptych are opened in succession, the sequence of images reveals the state of Man before the Fall to his restoration to a state of Grace through Christ. The scene of The Annunciation is the left panel on the back of the triptych.The Modena Triptych strikingly illustrates El Greco's transition from post-Byzantine icon painter to European artist of the Latin variety. The portable altarpiece, whose unknown patron perhaps stemmed from a Creto-Venetian family, in its open state shows a total of six scenes: on the front, the central panel bears a rare depiction of the Coronation of the Christian Knight, and on the wings we find the Adoration of the Shepherds on the left and the Baptism of Christ on the right. On the reverse, a View of Mount Sinai with its famous convent of St Catherine is flanked by an Annunciation  and an Admonition of Adam and Eve by God the Father. This type of object with its gilded frame elements was common in Cretan workshops of the 16th century, as is its use of wood as a painting support

20897-destruct.jpg	"Cornelius, Schadow, and Schnorr were pioneering in monumental history painting, which was to play so great a role in the second half of the 19th century. Huge panoramic paintings were installed in nearly all the public buildings to make them centres of culture.

10341-2bocca1.jpg	"La Bocca della Verit&#224; (in English, ""the Mouth of Truth"") is an image, carved from marble, of a man-like face, located in the portico of the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, Italy. The sculpture is thought to be part of a 1st century ancient Roman fountain portraying one of several possible pagan gods, probably Oceanus.The most famous characteristic of the Mouth, however, is its role as a lie detector. Starting from the Middle Ages, it was believed that if one told a lie with one's hand in the mouth of the sculpture, it would be bitten off. The piece was placed in the portico of the Santa Maria in Cosmedin in the 17th century.In the fourteenth century this tradition was spun out into a popular story which was part of a group illustrating the 'duplicity of women.' A woman accused of adultery had to undergo the test of the Bocca della Verit&#224; in front of her husband and a judge. She persuaded her lover to come with her disguised as a fool and at the crucial moment he mischievously embraced her. She could then swear that no man apart from her husband and that fool had ever touched her.In Cranach' depiction the jealous husband  is portrayed in sharp profile on the right, the judge in his ermine-trimmed robe is on the left. In depictions made north of the Alps, the Bocca was replaced by a bronze lion on a pedestal"

15749-madrid1.jpg	During his stay in Spain, Giaquinto enjoyed a high reputation equal to that of his compatriot Gianbattista Tiepolo. His output includes a number of altarpieces and easel paintings, although his most important legacy exists through his frescos painted for his royal patron, the most celebrated of which are for the Royal Chapel and the principal staircase of the Palacio de Oriente. Giaquinto's work left a profound influence on the generation of artists working in Spain during the second half of the 18th century, such as Francisco Bayeu, Antonio Gonz�lez Vel�zquez and even Francisco de Goya.These frescoes are on the vault above the main staircase of the Royal Palace in Madrid.

15146-adormag1.jpg	Gentile da Fabriano's painting is not a geometrically constructed composition. It should be read as if it were the text of a tale, beginning at the top left corner, where the three Magi, meeting at the seaside, notice the star they have to follow. If we follow their course among sloping hills and cultivated fields we can see how they march into Jerusalem under the frame of the central arch, while in the lunette on the right we can see them departing. In the middle distance the direction of their journey changes, proceeding towards us and suddenly the mass of people appears from a deep ravine flanked up by a precipitous rock and a fence. Now we can discern the faces too, and observe the smallest details of garments, arms and harness. Then the crowd, which can pride itself on hunters, noble chargers and exotic animals too, stops at the right-hand corner of the foreground, having reached its destination. Only here does the youngest King's page remove his master's spurs; having sunk to one knee the second King is on the point of handing over his gift, whereas the oldest, who has already presented his, is kneeling and kissing the Infant Jesus' foot. The elegant handmaids of the Virgin are taking delight in the lovely sight.In a masterly way Gentile da Fabriano launches, moves and stops this huge crowd of people. On the shores of the endless sea, underneath the left upper lunette, the figures of the three Magi on the summit of a mountain are surrounded by an atmosphere of cosmic stillness, while the march itself is exceedingly animated. Lively conversations are in progress, the horses are ambling and the limitless wonders of nature attract the travellers' attention. The scene of the Magi paying homage (also in the left-hand side) is calm again, emanating profound devotion and meditation. The somewhat dilapidated gate and the cave separate the principal characters from the episodes narrating what had happened earlier and it gives them some quiet in the otherwise overcrowded composition.The plentiful realism of details which Gentile da Fabriano produced achieved such convincing effects that it approached the Renaissance ideal of representing reality. He was not only able to depict objects accurately, but also every tiny change of facial expressions and the direction of glances establishing links between people. Nor did he forget the spectator, since the donor of the altarpiece, Palla Strozzi, standing behind the youngest King, is looking at us

00366-1satyr.jpg	A family of satyrs has settled on a tree-covered slope at the foot of a cliff. The man with horns and goat's feet is shown holding a club, while a blonde woman nestles against him and supports the child standing on her thigh. The couple seem to be oblivious of a scene taking place in a nearby meadow, where a woman in a red dress is attempting to flee from a naked man who is carrying a stick in one hand and holding her fast with the other.The uninhibited way of life of human or semi-human beings in the freedom of natural surroundings was a frequently occurring theme in literary and pictorial works of the Renaissance, following the precedent of antiquity. German artists became familiar with subjects of this kind mainly through copper-engravings by Andrea Mantegna and other northern Italian artists. By no means all these themes were derived straight from antiquity; frequently they were mythological fantasies inspired by Roman relief sculpture.The whole atmosphere of Altdorfer's idyllic scene suggests that it was inspired not so much by engravings as by the Arcadian landscapes of Venetian painters of the school of Giorgione; yet, although the motif of the naked woman seen from behind seems to confirm this, Altdorfer's approach to his art is fundamentally different. The satisfaction of depicting the nude, for which scenes from antiquity provided the most obvious pretext, is entirely subordinate in Altdorfer's paintings to his rendering of nature. The figures, which are fairly summarily treated, remain small and relatively inconspicuous against the dense wooded background. Whether the painter actually visited Venice is not certain but it does seem highly likely. About 1500 he was working in the Salzburg region at the Mondsee monastery, before he acquired burgher's rights in Regensburg in 1505. The present work, produced two years later, is one of Altdorfer's earliest signed and dated paintings. Like Cranach's Rest on the Flight, painted in 1504, it points the way to a new awareness of landscape in the Renaissance period, originally stemming from the so-called Danube school.Around the middle of the last century this portrait was in the Kraenner Collection in Regensburg; it later passed into the collection of Barthel Suermondt, which was purchased for the Berlin Gallery in 1874

28658-5cathed3.jpg	When Monet began his serial compositions in the late 1880s, which initially featured haystacks, then polars, and in the early 1890s the cathedral at Rouen, these works constituted a logical progression of his artistic interests. By constantly portraying the same subject, the variables determined by the time of the day and the lighting could be particularly strongly accentuated. Different times of day and a changing colour palette were substituted for innovative subject matter. Monet included the time of the day and the dominant colours in the respective titles of his paintings as a matter of course.Sometimes he worked simultaneously on two canvases, in order to be able to react immediately to changing light conditions. As a result, the subject of the picture receded further and further into the background. At first glance we can see the shape of a cathedral, but on closer inspection the cathedral architecture dissolves before our eyes into a vibrant ensemble, composed merely of a collection of brush strokes

07818-5triump.jpg	"Episode No. 5 of the series of seven paintings ""Episodes from the Life of Sts Jerome, George and Triphun"".In the preparatory drawing for the Triumph of St George, now in the Uffizi Drawings Collection, the new colour density relies more on the perspective construction and the accurate modelling than is the case in the actual painting, where the lavish costumes of the inhabitants of Selene and the ornate trappings of their horses are arranged like highly colourful stage backdrops on either side of the main event. In the middle, alone, St George deals the dying dragon the final blow. Behind him, the city of Selene stands out against the background of green and brown hills and pale blue sky; despite their Oriental flavour, the buildings are arranged and decorated in a totally Venetian way, especially the large construction in the centre, which is somewhat reminiscent of Solomon's Temple or the Kubbet-es Sakbra Mosque in Jerusalem as illustrated in Reeuwich's engravings"
