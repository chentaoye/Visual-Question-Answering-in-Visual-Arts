11198-1880s_18.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries

18264-0803grec.jpg	El Greco painted many representations of St Francis, all showing him in meditation, receiving the stigmata or experiencing a vision. Devotion to St Francis was highly developed in Spain, and in El Greco's time there were in Toledo alone ten Franciscan religious institutions. Many ordinary Toledans were members of the Third Order of Saint Francis, established so that lay people could participate in the spiritual life of the Franciscans. (El Greco himself was a lay Franciscan.) This serves to explain the success of El Greco's images of the saint.

36591-triumph.jpg	This large tondo featuring the Triumph of Fame on its front side was painted to celebrate the birth of Lorenzo de' Medici who was later known as Lorenzo il Magnifico. This is one of many examples of such two-sided tondi painted for Florentine families, although exactly how they were used is still uncertain.The theme chosen for this one derived from the Triumphs of Petrarch and Boccaccio's The Vision of Love. Trumpets announce the arrival of Fame from the globe on which the allegorical figure stands and knights arrive to honour her.The feathers on the frame are a reference to Lorenzo's father Piero de Gouty, and the reverse of the tondo features other references to the Medici, as well as to the family of Lorenzo's mother, Lucrezia Tornabuoni

19086-04nooff.jpg	The portrait of the Officers of the St George Civic Guard is the first major group portrait by Frans Hals, and the first monumental civic guard painting in the new era of Dutch painting. Together with the leaders of public, charitable and professional associations, the civic guard societies were the main patrons to commission group portraits. This patronage took on considerable proportions in the course of the century. These group portraits are also of value as historical documents, for which lists were drawn up giving the names of the figures portrayed. The paintings themselves were displayed prominently on the premises of the respective association.These civic guard portraits were an expression of the Baroque will to representation, whose tradition is rooted in the medieval era. There had been civic guards in the Netherlands since the 13th century. They had played an important role in the emancipation of the cities and towns from feudal rule and had gained considerable political and military significance in the Netherlands' struggle for independence.Cornelis van Haarlem had already painted the officers of the St George Civic Guard in 1599. Hals, however, revolutionizes this type of painting. Instead of merely painting a row of individual portraits, he places them within a specific context by creating a banquet scene. This is not simply a moment captured at a table, but an extremely witty and calculated composition in which a scenic context is created between all the figures involved, and, on the other hand, each of the figures poses and acts independently and individually. Hals has found a new and persuasive solution to the problem of portraying a large group without difference of rank.Hals seems to have arranged the officers casually around the festive board. But this is not the case. The places they occupy are in strict accord with military protocol. The colonel, the company's highest ranking officer, is seated at the head of the table; at his right is the provost, the second ranking officer. They are flanked by the company's three captains and the three lieutenants are at the lower end of the table. The three ensigns, who were not members of the officer corps, and the servant stand. Hals other group portraits of officers at banquet tables, which look equally informal, follow a similar hierarchical arrangement

30406-madchild.jpg	"In the inventory of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's paintings compiled by Giovanni Battista Agucchi in 1603, a double-sided picture is mentioned, with a Nativity on one side and a Madonna on the other. In 1638 the painting was left by Ippolito Aldobrandini to his only niece Olimpia, who had married for a second time to Camillo Pamphilj senior. In a list of the same property made prior to 1665, the work is recorded as still being in one piece, ""with gilded frame at the front of the Parmigianino [and] with a pedestal covered with crimson velvet and gold trimming."" The work was obviously held in high regard, and probably intended, from the outset, for use as a small altar for private devotion.The votive picture was still in this state in 1709 and only subsequently split into two separate parts. Before this investigation of the archives was carried out, the two pictures had been considered two separate works intended as companion pieces. Curiously, in 1603 Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's collection contained another small Nativity surrounded by angels, also by Parmigianino but not the same as the one here.This delightful example of sacred painting with its curved and supple lines, in which the Madonna with her hands joined in moving and gentle spirituality and the Child with a dove perched on an open book, undoubtedly inspired by Correggio, are set against a background of trees stirred by a light breeze, probably dates from around 1525. It would therefore have been painted at the time of the Fontanellato frescoes, that is prior to the artist's stay in Rome"

29282-214muril.jpg	According to tradition, the models were from the province of Galicia and attained a certain notoriety as courtesans in Seville. A man of the people, Murillo obviously intended this picture to both surprise and amuse the spectator. Yet the casualness of this painting masks a sure sense design - note how the girls' heads form a diagonal that bisects the canvas - and great technical skill. Although he had begun by selling his pictures at fairs, Murillo became conversant with and influenced by the works of Vel�zquez, Titian and Rubens, presumably as a result of studying the royal collections in Madrid. But Murillo never lost his popular appeal or his gift for the telling expression, such as the smile of the uppermost woman, indicated only by her eyes and cheeks

39630-2rabbit.jpg	"In 1529  Federico Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua ordered three more works from Titian. The only one to survive is probably identifiable with the Madonna and Child with St Catherine and a Shepherd, known as the Madonna of the Rabbit. With a look of winning encouragement the Virgin restrains the rabbit, a symbol of fecundity, so that the child can clamber down and play with it. The richly dressed St Catherine, proffering her charge like a lady-in- waiting, introduces a courtly aspect, and in fact the Giorgionesque shepherd in the background may be a portrait of Federico himself: Since x-rays show that the Madonna's head was originally turned in his direction. In the foreground, the delicate wild flowers recall the locus amoenus or ""idyllic setting"" of classical poetry, and in the park-like landscape we see the Arcadia of the Concert Champ&#234;tre refracted through the smiling fertility of the Ferrara Bacchanals. Nowhere else does Titian so successfully integrate the traditions of the Sacra Conversazione and the Pastoral.This painting mainly captivates through the beauty of its colours and the marvellous landscape. The small format is a sign that this was a private devotional picture. What at first sight appears to be a normal picture of the Madonna gains an additional, very private dimension as a result"

04836-vanitas.jpg	The painting shows a sarcophagus in a half-ruined church, with its vanishing point on the left. Objects of vanity are assembled in the foreground, piled up in the shape of a pyramid and culminating in an ermine coat, a turban (at the very top, at the banister, next to the skull), a royal crown, a mitre and a globe. These symbols of secular and ecclesiastical power at the zenith of the composition are further explained by a richly decorated bowl, worked by a goldsmith. It shows mythological scenes of unhappy love relationships, partly covering those 'vanitates' which are of lower order - a tambourine, lute, sabre, coat of mail and painter's palette, to name but a few. The statue of a mourning female figure in one of the niches bears great resemblance to the woman whose contours can be seen in Nicolas Poussin's famous self-portrait  at the Louvre. She can be regarded as a late successor to the weeping women who surround the altar tomb of Philip the Bold in Dijon.Pieter Boel's painting contains all the features normally associated with baroque solemnity, i.e. pomp and splendour even where power and wealth have become subject to the darkness of death. However, although all earthly possessions and authority are marked as vain, the dialectic of the painting never leaves any doubt that their real substance remains undisputed in this world and that the earthly order is preserved intact

10001-lastjudg.jpg	This work illustrate the influence exerted in the Low Countries by the Italian Renaissance. A variety of artists made the journey to Italy in the 16th century, where they absorbed the new artistic ideas. Their work brought an entirely new approach to religious painting compared to the pious, inward-looking art of the 15th century. Novel elements included brilliant compositions and above all the heightened attention to the human body - a focus that led to frequent exaggeration.Coxcie's Last Judgment is a rather unsuccessful attempt to match the anatomical skills of the great Italian masters. It was painted for the Town Hall in Ghent, to replace a 15th-century Last Judgment that was destroyed during the mid-16th-century Iconoclasm.

35538-01medici.jpg	Thanks to his organisational capacities, Rubens could meet demand and revolutionise the problem of large-scale pictorial decoration. His renown extended well beyond the frontiers of his country, and in 1621 Marie de M�dicis, widow of Henri IV of France and mother of the reigning king Louis XIII, invited him to Paris. She wished him to decorate one of the galleries of the newly built Palais de Luxembourg with 24 monumental paintings commemorating episodes in the lives of herself and her renowned husband. The creation of a cycle of tapestries had, in a sense, been Rubens' technical apprenticeship for this demanding task, the composition of a cycle of vast narrative paintings dedicated to a living queen who had already entered history.Giving epic treatment to this biographical subject, Rubens was also able to give free rein to his fertile invention. He prepared two series of oil sketches, with detailed figures drawn in, which it then fell to his assistants to scale up to the dimensions of the canvases commissioned. These were then meticulously retouched by the master so that they might be ultimately be described, at least in the final layers of paint, as his own works. The entire commission was completed in only three years.All of his prodigious culture was drawn on for these works: his encyclopaedic knowledge of classical mythology was exploited to the full in transforming the queen's entire career - Henri slipped rather into the background - into a kind of operatic sequence largely of Rubens' own invention. Metamorphosing life into myth, he freely mingled historical personages with the gods of Olympus, who came to represent them. The scheme of this apparatus was invented as he went along, the - often gratuitous - interpolations of the divine gracefully leavening the uneventful royal life. It had required all of Rubens' imaginative resources and natural verve to ennoble and illustrate the relatively colourless circumstances of the Queen Mother's life. These qualities were essential; Rubens' international renown depended on his success in this formidable commission. His solution was to populate his compositions with nude goddesses, pagan gods, curvaceous undines, mischievous tritons, and genii unspecified. His customary contrasts are at work in the playful opposition of gleaming cuirasses and lusty bodies, fragile silks and the rugged hulls of dreadnoughts. The poverty of his subject was utterly transcended; this is pure painting, nothing but painting.Certainly, it was not the rather heavy features of the Medici family, particularly evident in the queen, that had attracted Henri IV, but the scale of her dowry. Rubens nevertheless contrived to render her portrait agreeable. He disguised her now as an attractive Bellona, now as a proud horsewoman in The Capture of Juliers. The royal couple become Olympian deities in The Meeting of Marie de M�dicis and Henri IV at Lyon, while The Fate Spinning Marie's Destiny and The Triumph of Truth became pretexts for a proliferation of female convexity

37530-5domeni.jpg	In the Cappella di Santa Caterina of the Sienese church of San Domenico, Sodoma's mural paintings dominate the decoration. The chapel was built in the late fifteenth century to house the relic of St Catherine's head in a marble tabernacle. Sodoma transformed the space to appear as if it were an open loggia resting on piers. The real altar is continued to the side as a painted balustrade, above which, in a wide opening on the left Catherine is seen fainting and, on the right, in ecstasy.Only the left-hand wall showing Catherine saving the soul of Niccol&#242; di Tuldo was completed by Sodoma. Here the artist uses particular means to bring us close to the scene: the lower balustrade is wide open; steps seem to lead out of the chapel to the site of the execution

The picture in Ottawa is probably that mentioned in 1545 in a letter from Pietro Aretino, which once belonged to the portrait collection of Paolo Giovio in Como. With the body turned slightly to the right and the grave, spiritual face framed by the beard and hair, Daniele Barbaro's gaze is fixed on the viewer. His black gown reveals scarcely anything except the left hand and the book, which, as an attribute of scholarship, alludes to Barbaro's humanistic education.

The spell of the night, gossip and musing, a kind of freshness which made the artist want to arrest the irrevocable charm of the moment. The artist's daughter was one of the models.

10246-1founta1.jpg	Cranach's painting is about the human yearning for immortality and eternal youth. Human beings dream of being young again, of leaving the worn outer shell and exchanging it for a new one. The notion of the cleansing power of the elements, especially of water, is as old as humankind itself. The centre of the scene is a pool filled with water. Some steps lead down to the pool, which is surrounded by a fantastic landscape far from civilisation. People have undertaken arduous journeys to reach this solitary spot and bathe in the miraculous waters.In the left half of the picture wrinkled and frail old women are brought up on carts and stretchers. They are undressed and examined by a doctor before stepping into the water where the gradual process of rejuvenation takes place. Their wrinkles and old sallow skin disappear, their flesh becomes rosy and smooth, and they turn into young girls. As they emerge from the water they are welcomed by a cavalier who shows them to a tent where they receive new clothes. Old peasant women are transformed into young ladies of the court who indulge in the carefree pleasures of life. The jollifications at the festive table, the dancing, music and lovemaking, all take place in a lush flowering landscape. These are the realms of eternal youth, to which the hardships of old age, set in a barren rocky landscape on the left side of the picture, form a stark contrast.The fountain spouting water from the spring into the pool bears the statues of Venus and Cupid - evidence that this is actually a fountain of love rather than youth, and that the power of love is the true source of immortality

A natural light lends tenderness to the holy figures. The Virgin, however, sits rigid like a Byzantine empress on a Gothic throne, surrounded by Masolinoesque angels who are holding the poles of the high canopy almost as if it were a game. The saints Gregory and Jerome on the left and Ambrose and Augustine on the right, stand immobile in their heavy ecclesiastical garments shining with gold and colour.

09698-04sabine.jpg	The Sacchetti family commissioned this painting in the 1620s when Pietro da Cortona was just making his name in Roman circles. They thus became his first patrons and introduced him to the world of aristocratic commissions. During the first two decades of the century, Caravaggio's naturalistic style had been rivaled by the Carracci cousins' academic style of classicism. Each school had its own followers and some attempts had been made to bring the two together. The arrival of Pietro da Cortona, at the same time as Bernini erupted onto the scene as the preferred sculptor and architect of the Barberini pope Urban VIII, were together sufficient to transform art in Rome and to create a true Baroque style.Pietro da Cortona's painting stands out for its open theatricality, lively gestures, richness of colour, and brushwork, as well as its diffused light. The Sabine women being lifted into the air deliberately derive from Bernini's works, such as Apollo and Daphne, as if to underline the bond between the two artists. There is little real violence in his treatment of this scene from Roman legend, merely a splendidly theatrical display of half-clothed bodies

35708-jewish_c.jpg	Ruins sometimes play a prominent role, and gloomy skies set a melancholy mood. Ruisdael's rare ability to create a compelling and tragic mood in nature is best seen in his famous Jewish Cemetery at Dresden. A larger, more elaborate autograph version is at the Detroit Institute of Arts. These works are moralizing landscapes that were painted with a deliberate allegorical programme. The combination of their conspicuous tombs, ruins, large dead beech trees, broken trunks, and rushing streams alludes to the familiar themes of transience and the vanity of life and the ultimate futility of human endeavour, while the burst of light that breaks through the ravening clouds in each painting, their rainbows and the luxuriant growth that contrasts with the dead trees offer a promise of hope and renewed life.The masterliness of the Dresden painting lies in the artist's clear and concentrated presentation of these ideas. The eye focuses on the three tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized. They present a truthful picture of the actual, identifiable sarcophagi as they can still be seen in the Portuguese-Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk on the Amstel River near Amsterdam. Ruisdael made carefully worked-up drawings of the tombs, one of which he used as a preparatory drawing for the paintings. But the landscape settings of the Dresden and Detroit paintings bear no resemblance whatsoever to the site at Ouderkerk. They are Ruisdael's inventions. The cemetery never had monumental ruins. Those seen in the Dresden version were transplants from the shattered remains of Egmond Castle near Alkmaar, a site about forty kilometres from Ouderkerk; they also are based on a preparatory drawing. The ruins seen in the Detroit painting are probably derived from the ruins of Egmond's old Abbey Church. A rushing stream does not bisect the actual burial ground. (Would anyone in his right mind place tombs near a vigorous stream which would wreak havoc with the tombstones and coffins beneath them when it flooded?) The stream was included as a traditional allusion to the passage of time. Most remarkable is the barren beech tree in the Dresden picture that gestures toward the three tombs and heavenwards. If ever a tree was capable of seducing a viewer to accept the pathetic fallacy of endowing natural forms with human feelings and emotions it is this dead beech.The iconographical programme of Ruisdael's two versions of the Jewish Cemetery leaves no doubt that they were intended as moralizing landscapes. He made no others that can be given a similar unmistakable reading. None of his other existing paintings include tombs; those done by his contemporaries are rare, and some of them are based on his depictions of the sarcophagi at Ouderkerk. However, Ruisdael made numerous pictures that include identifiable or imaginary ruins, dead and broken trees, rushing streams, rivers, and waterfalls. Were these motifs invariably intended by the artist as symbols of transience and the vanity of life, and does the handful of them that include rainbows allude to hope? It has been argued that this is indeed the case, and that these motifs not only offer the iconographical essence of Ruisdael's landscapes but offer the key to the meaning to seventeenth-century landscape painting. According to this interpretation they were intended as visual sermons to convey the biblical message that man lives in a transient world beset by sinful temptation, but may hope for salvation

00124-marketst.jpg	The painting demonstrates a wide range of agricultural products, made possible by the improvements in production methods. Offering her fruits and vegetables, the woman is almost an appendage to her produce. Despite all exaggeration, the picture quite adequately shows the new economic prosperity of the time. At the same time, however, it still contains a background scene in genre style of embracing lovers in a stable, thus relating the painting to late medieval peasant satires. Peasants were regarded as lustful, sensuous and carnal by the middle classes

07597-57salome.jpg	On his way back to Rome Caravaggio returned to Naples. This harsh late work has none of the beauty of some of the late Sicilian pictures, such as the altarpiece stolen from the Oratory of San Lorenzo in Palermo, and it may reflect the assault Caravaggio endured in the Osteria del Cerriglio in the city. A sense of the tired mood of one aware of the pointlessness of a ruthless vendetta pervades the painting.The Baptist has been executed for denouncing Salome's mother Herodias over her illicit marriage with Herod. Caravaggio uses the device of planting two heads - Salome's and her maid's (or her mother's) - so close together that they seem to grow out of one body as the contrasting stages of youth and age. This had been a trait of Leonardo's, and the way that the head of St John is presented to the spectator recalls a picture by Leonardo's pupil Luini, whose Salome also looks away from her victim. The executioner takes no joy in what he has been commanded to do. He feels only a stunned emotion in keeping with the sombre tones that Caravaggio adopts.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

33433-01oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 486.This painting dates from shortly after Rembrandt had set up as an independent artist in Leiden in 1625. The subject is taken from the Apocryphal Book of Tobit (Chapter II, vv, 11-14). Tobit was a wealthy, God-fearing Jew, strict in his observance of the Mosaic law, who had lost all his money and been blinded in an accident. To keep them from starving, his wife Anna took in sewing and washing. One day, hearing the bleating of a kid which Anna had been given to supplement her earnings, Tobit falsely accuses her of having stolen it. In return, she upbraids him for his self-righteousness which has brought them to their present plight (this is the scene represented in the picture). Later, however, the couple's fortunes are restored by their son, Tobias, who goes to find the money his father has lost and to marry a rich wife. On the way he meets the Angel Raphael, who instructs him when they come to a river to catch a large fish, the entrails of which are afterwards applied to Tobit's eyes to cure his blindness.In this work Rembrandt depicts the psychological tension between the two protagonists. The mood of the blind old Tobit suddenly becomes one of suspicion and despair when he wonders how his wife, Anna, has managed to lay hands on a kid. She in turn is baffled by his mistrust.The space depicted is confined but packed with domestic detail: onions hanging up by the window, a basket on the wall, cooking utensils on the shelves, part of Anna's sewing apparatus glimpsed between the two figures, and, in the foreground, Tobit's stick, his dog and a modest fire.Such meticulously painted still-life detail had been a characteristic of Netherlandish art since the fifteenth century. However, in contrast to so many examples of its use up to and including the seventeenth century, it appears here to be without ulterior symbolic meaning; the purpose is to give the maximum reality to the events of the story

00849-35_eucha.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 35 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.In contrast to most frescoes in the cells of the friars and novices, those in the corridor of the lay brethren are illustrative narratives that closely follow the Gospel of Matthew. These portrayals were directed to a community that was less attuned to theological and visual abstraction. Many of the scenes are situated in mountainous landscapes or detailed architectural settings. The Institute of the Eucharist in Cell 35 underscored the Dominicans devotion to the Eucharist, which St Thomas articulated most eloquently in composing the office for the feast of Corpus Domini. It transpires in a spacious room similar to the convent's actual refectory and repeats elements of San Marco's own architecture - the arched windows of the dormitory, the well in the second cloister - to emphasize its relevance to the lay brother.This fresco was executed by an assistant of Fra Angelico

38442-10szinye.jpg	"The artist never accepted commissions to paint portraits; all the portraits he painted featured members of his family. These representations, each of which is a pearl of intimate Realism, reach the soul of the model. Szinyei began to paint portraits of this wife on several occasions, but he was not always able to finish them, because his wife, in sharp contrast with Szinyei's contemplating character, was ever so busy that she had difficulty tolerating the modelling sessions. She set both for the famous ""Woman in Lilac Dress"" (1874) and for the ""Portrait in Shawl"". The latter portrait was not finished in 1880: the deep scarlet coloured velvet dress his wife is shown wearing was completed only around 1890, long after the couple's divorce in 1887. (In actual fact Szinyei's daughter was sitting as model.) The painting is dominated by the delicate and sensitive beauty of the model's face, radiating from the background of warm colours. In Szinye's pictures, the women are often shown wearing in their hair or on their hats colourful flowers, or as in the case of ""Portrait in Shawl"", laces and ribbons. We can almost be certain that he did not use them just to conform with the fashion of the age. These colourful patches were necessary to emphasize the beauty of the face and the fine rosiness of the skin, as well as to produce a definite separation from the dark background"

03673-the_duet.jpg	A young woman strums her lute in an expansive, stone interior. A male accompanist, whose crude facial features contrast pointedly with the more delicate ones of his companion, sings and plays the violin beside her. His plain outfit differs from his friends elegant attire. The lavish fabrics are complemented by the expensive instruments: in addition to the violin and lute, a bass violin rests against the bench in the foreground while a shawm, the ancestor of the oboe, lies just above it. Costly music books are also heaped beside the figures. The murky, grayish-brown background of this ambiguous, lapidary setting also contains a large ewer and expansive curtain whose knots and folds echo the fabric encasing the lutenist. The emphasis here is upon luxury.

12493-08lotdau.jpg	This delightfully spontaneous panel depicts Lot and his two daughters fleeing from the destruction of Sodom. In the story from Genesis, two angels warn Lot that he should escape before God destroys the city for its sins. Lot is told that his family must not look back, otherwise they will be turned into pillars of salt.In D�rer's panel, Lot leads the way, dressed in a warm fur-lined coat and a magnificent turban. He carries a basket of eggs and has a flask of wine slung over his shoulder on his stick. His two daughters follow several paces behind, one bearing a bundle on her head and the other with an elegant casket and a distaff and yarn. Far behind them, near the towering rocks, is Lot's wife, transformed into a brown pillar of salt. In the distance the town of Sodom explodes with brimstone and fire, huge columns of smoke belching up into the sky. Gomorrah, in the far distance, suffers a similar fate.This depiction of Lot's flight is not the main picture, but the reverse of a panel of the Virgin and Child. The two sides are quite different, not only in subject-matter but also in style. The Lot panel is painted in a loose, spontaneous manner, whereas the Virgin and Child is much more finely worked. However, D�rer must have intended them to be seen together. The panel was painted for the Nuremberg merchant family of Haller, whose arms appear in the bottom left corner of the panel of the Virgin.Virgin and Child at a Window was long assumed to be the work of the Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini, because of its composition and colouring. In 1934 it was identified as a D�rer, painted about three years after his return from Venice. It was bought by Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza, who owned it until 1950

18370-1605grec.jpg	In collaboration with his son Jorge Manuel in 1603-07, El Greco executed an extensive programme of pictures for the Hospital de la Caridad in Illescas: a Madonna of Charity, a Coronation of the Virgin, an Annunciation, and a Nativity. Under a separate contract a further picture was made, of St Ildefonso, who was particularly important for Toledo. The painting is in the side altar on the left of the main chapel of the church, balancing the Virgin of Charity. Its original place in the church is not known. The painting is not mentioned in the incomplete documentation for the decoration of the chapel, and if, as is probable, it was not painted at the same time, it cannot date much before June 1603, the date of the contract, and was more likely painted soon after the conclusion of litigation in August 1607. In its present position, it makes a grand pair to the Virgin of Charity, and is one of the most splendid of his 'portraits' of Saints.It is difficult, and perhaps not proper, to separate his portraits of Saints from his actual portraits. In both he employs all his means of spiritual or psychological expression. The legend is that Saint Ildefonso, the first Bishop of Toledo, presented an image of the Virgin of the Mantle to a foundation of his in Illescas. The Saint is portrayed before the same image, as he wrote his dissertation on the Purity of the Virgin. The state of inspiration is brilliantly expressed. There is an infinite distinction in expression between the hand poised with the pen in this 'portrait' and the similar motif in the portrait of his son.In his depiction of St Ildefonso, El Greco anticipated a Baroque motif, that of the learned churchman. As if receiving inspiration, the saint is seated at a desk covered with an array of utensils that is unusually detailed for the artist.There is a smaller replica of the picture in the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It belonged once to the painter Jean Fran�ois Millet, and later to Edgar Degas

34219-s_onufri.jpg	Ribera studied in Francisco Ribalta's workshop in Valencia, but when still young he went to Naples, then under Spanish rule, where he worked for the rest of his life. He was called there as Lo Spagnoletto. He obtained most of his commissions from the Spanish Viceroy and his entourage, but he also completed a good many paintings for the churches of the city.The influence of Caravaggio was felt throughout southern Italy and there can be little doubt that Ribera was the artist with the strongest and most independent personality of all his followers. Ribera represented crude reality boldly and without embellishment. The construction of his pictures is monumental and he reveals a strong sense of drama, empahasized by means of strongly contrasting light and shade. The poor inhabitants of Naples and the peasants of southern Italy were his models, and he depicted them without flattery or idealization as enormous figures clothed in rags. The painting of Saint Onufri also shows the influence of Caravaggio

20797-virgin_c.jpg	The composition of this remarkably refined little painting is based on a lost small work by Memling, which is best reflected in the Virgin of the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Since the dimensions correspond, the work must have been done with a tracing or punch-cardboard based on the original. The version discussed here shows the image in the right direction. The Virgin is represented high above a landscape, more monumental than the prototype. She stands behind a wall over which a white cloth is draped with very heavy folds. This also differs from the model. The panel was incorrectly ascribed to Michel Sittow, and later attributed to Juan de Flandes in 1966. On account of the quality, the typical facial features and the vaporous green-grey landscape, this attribution cannot be doubted. The panel originated about the time of the Retablo Mayor of Palencia (c. 1510) and may have been the central panel of a small triptych described in the accounts of Palencia Cathedral as the 'tabla oratorio de tress pie�as'. If so, it could have been a work in the style of Memling's Triptych of Benedetto Portinari (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi), with a donor and a saint in front of a continuous landscape on the wings

31940-03josep3.jpg	The painting belongs to the series of four entitled Scenes from the Life of Joseph the Hebrew, now in the National Gallery, London. These works, together with others by Andrea del Sarto, Francesco Granacci, Bachiacca and Franciabigio, were intended for the decoration of the nuptial chamber of Francesco Borgherini and Margherita Acciaioli, who married in 1515. The group of fourteen paintings, broken up at the end of the 16th century, was contained within a wooden decoration made by Baccio d'Agnolo.In this panel the thesis proposed by Mannerism is fully elaborated: the painter is no longer to be bound by perspective, or by the necessity of presenting his subject in a rational, objective manner. He may use light and colour, chiaroscuro and proportion as he pleases; he may borrow from any source he chooses; the only obligation upon him is to create an interesting design, expressive of the ideas inherent in the subject, and the various parts need bear no relationship to each other. The colour must be evocative and beautiful in itself.This work, traditionally entitled Joseph in Egypt, depicts the most significant episodes of Joseph reuniting with his family of origin. The painting is divided into four distinct zones. In the left foreground Joseph presents his family, who he invited to move to Egypt, to the pharaoh; according to Vasari, the boy with dark cloak and brown tunic sitting on the first step of the stairs on which the figures are arranged, is a portrait of the young Bronzino. On the right, Joseph is seen sitting on a triumphal cart pulled by three putti; hoisting himself up with his left arm and clutching firmly onto a putto with the other, he bends toward a kneeling figure who is presenting him a petition or reading him a message; a fifth putto, wrapped in a piece of cloth blown by the wind, dominates the scene from the top of a column, appearing to mime the gesture of one of the two half-living statues represented in the top left and centre of the painting. A restless crowd, curious to see what is going on, throngs the adjacent space between the two buildings in the background. Other mysterious figures, resting against one of the large boulders that dominate the landscape, turn their attention toward the action in the foreground.The clothes, expressions and features of all these figures are inspired by northern European painting, as is the large castle and surrounding trees depicted in the background. On the unrailed staircase of the imposing cylindrical building to the right, Joseph takes one of his children by the hand; higher up, the other is greeted affectionately by his mother. Lastly, Joseph and his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, are portrayed inside the room at the top of the building, where Jacob, now old and near to death, imparts his paternal blessing. The curious combination of all these elements confers to the painting an anomalous and intriguing quality

43591-9marymag.jpg	This painting, formerly given to Pomarancio, has been reattributed to Simon Vouet. It may perhaps be identifiable with the Magdalene cited with an attribution to Sacchi in the 1648-49 inventory of the Palazzo Barberini at Monterotondo.The painting, which shows some stylistic and typological connections with the Vouet's David in Palazzo Bianco in Genoa, could date from the years (c. 1623-27) in which the French artist was in close contact with the Barberini, ending with his departure for France. Though the canvas is certainly rich in Caravaggesque qualities, Vouet is already showing himself as a full participant in the new classicism that was on the rise in the Roman art scene. At the same time he also shows signs of sympathy with the first fully baroque works that were being created in Rome.This painting poses interesting problems on account of its close compositional connections to the Magdalene by Guido Reni, dated to 1631-32 (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). The cut of the scene anticipates the composition that Vouet adopted for his Portrait of Gaucher de Chatillon (Louvre, Paris), carried out for the Palace of Cardinal Richelieu between 1633 and 1634. Dominated by the monumental figure of the Magdalene, the picture opens out to a luxuriant perspectival landscape view in the left background. Another highly interesting element is the close stylistic analogy between the Magdalene and Vouet's Allegory of Peace, that was also in the Barberini collection (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). As the Allegory has been attributed to an anonymous brother of the Cavalier Muti (a student of Vouet and Claude Mellan), the similarities between the two pictures lead to basic questions about the true authorship of this extraordinary painting

26364-corsini.jpg	The picture shows the ceiling fresco in the reading room of the library of the Accademia dei Lincei in the Palazzo Corsini.The shape of the frame alludes to Pietro da Cortona's ceiling in Santa Maria in Vallicella. This frame, especially characteristic of Rome, was popular both in sacred and secular contexts, and was also frequently used in horizontal-format compositions. The ceiling in the library of Palazzo Corsini, painted by the Florentine Vincenzo Meucci, is a good example. Befitting the stature of the Corsini family, which supplied a pope in Clement XII, the pictorial program combines motifs alluding to the function of the library (church fathers and scholars) with the personification of Ecclesia, angels, putti, virtues, and vanquished vices

As well as the Madonna of the Rosary, the fresco also extols St Dominic, the founder of the Dominican order, to whom the dog is a reference (lat. domini canes, God's hounds).

21312-03sebast.jpg	There is a group of painting attributed to Georges de La Tour depicting St Sebastian and St Irene. Part of them is a horizontal composition where the model of one of the figures is a familiar La Tour type. Most of the versions are curiously incompetent, only three of them having pretensions to quality. The upright versions of the same subject (one in the Louvre and the other in Berlin) are more celebrated. The composition is monumental, as if the painting were depicting a sculptured tableau.The Louvre composition is especially moving, with the mourning figure in a blue cowl (in the Berlin version the cowl is black) looking as if she were taken from a piece of Burgundian tomb sculpture. Recent observations on the possible dating of the costumes have left little doubt that the picture is rather later than the artist's lifetime. �tienne de La Tour, the son of the artist was suggested (but not accepted) as the possible author. �tienne de La Tour is actually documented as being required to continue his father's style, should the latter die inopportunately, and it is likely that he continued long into the 1660s and even the 1670s, painting ever-weaker versions of his father's work which eventually became mockeries of his father's genius

30613-2mira11.jpg	Toward the end of the seventeenth century, Cesare Alessandri, a wealthy Venetian merchant had a wing erected to the side of his villa, to be used as foresteria (guest quarters). Decorations embellish three rooms on the second floor; the paintings in the central hall and in the northwest room are attributed to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini. The fresco cycles in these two rooms constitute the first private fresco commission given to Pellegrini after his return to Venice from Rome. His stay in Rome had been beneficial to his development, enabling him to incorporate into his own visual repertory the language of Luca Giordano and Baciccio.The frescoes that adorn the northwest room, with the scene Hannibal Swearing his Hatred of the Romans, one can detect a certain stiffening of the figures compared to the rendering of those in the central hall.

32256-08triump.jpg	The Triumph of Pan was one of several paintings commissioned from Poussin, in 1636 the leading French artist in Rome, by Cardinal Richelieu. They were intended for a room in his ch&#226;teau in Poitou which would also house mythological pictures by Mantegna, Perugino and Costa. Poussin must have been advised about the scale not only of the canvases but also of the figures, for although he never saw the Renaissance paintings his personages are much the same size as theirs. He must also have been told that the pictures were to be set above a high dado, divided by gilt caryatids, gold fleur-de-lys against a blue ground, and marine battles, all under a gilt ceiling.The Cabinet de la Chambre du Roy in Richelieu's ch&#226;teau celebrated the cardinal's 'gift' to Louis XIII of mastery of the seas. The room, with its 'Combat of Wealth and Art', as a contemporary panegyric puts it, and furnished in addition to paintings and panelling with porphyry vases and ancient busts, must have presented a formidable challenge to Poussin. Not only would he be competing with some of the foremost Italian Renaissance artists, his pictures also had to contend with the glittering d�cor - hence the colours here are among the most brilliant he ever lavished on a painting. Sadly, the room was dismantled long ago and the pictures dispersed, so we can judge the full effect only in our mind's eye.Poussin carefully allowed for the spectator's point of view. Nimble visitors to the Gallery can sit on the floor to look at this picture in order better to appreciate its spatial construction, and thus its full significance. The revellers occupy a raised stage extending back to where rocks and vine-hung trees screen off the backdrop of sky and distant mountains. Propped up vertically against this earthen stage are a timbrel and two masks - an ancient satyr mask and a modern Italian Columbine. Behind them a Punchinello mask joins a still life drawn from the imagery of ancient bacchanals: thyrsoi - staffs wreathed with ivy and surmounted by pine cones - the crooked stick and pipes of Pan, wine in a metal bowl or crater, and a Greek wine jar showing the god Dionysus, the Roman Bacchus.The composition is indebted to an engraving after Giulio Romano, a pupil of Raphael, but Poussin also demonstrates his first-hand access to antiquarian lore. The mixture of modern and ancient masks, and the stage-like construction, allude to the origins of theatre in bacchic rites. The main scene represents the 'triumph' or worship of the armless bust of a horned deity mounted on a pillar, his face smeared red with the juice of boiled ivy stems. This is the 'term' of Pan, Arcadian god of shepherds and herdsmen, and Priapus, a phallic god of fertility, protector of gardens, whose cult was imported into Greece from the Near East. Confused with each other, both were associated with Dionysus/Bacchus: Dionysus, god of the grape-vine, who died, descended into Hades then rose again was himself identified with seasonal decay and rebirth. All the participants are members of his entourage (as we find them in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne): nymphs and their lewd playmates the satyrs; maenads who rend deer limb from limb or strew flowers from the winnowing basket sacred to Dionysus. A world of pagan imaginings is brought to life in all its cruel and seductive charm, without a hint of anachronistic moralising

24924-metropo1.jpg	This double-sided panel shows on one side the martyrdom of St Lawrence and on the other a woman offering drink to a bedridden man. The work is a fragment of an altarpiece shutter, in which the St Lawrence scene on gold ground would have been oriented to the interior, visible in the altarpiece's open state.Three other double-sided panels were recognized as part of the same altarpiece. These panels also depict acts of mercy on the exterior, namely Beheading of John the Baptist (interior) and Providing Shelter to Strangers (exterior) and Feast of Herod (interior) and Feeding the Hungry (exterior), both panels in the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift, Trier, as well as St Lawrence before the Emperor (interior) and Clothing the Naked (exterior) in a private collection. The dismantled altarpiece was attributed to an unknown master in Salzburg named after this ensemble as Master of the Acts of Mercy.A plausible reconstruction assumes a total of six acts of mercy, and arranges the wing scenes in two tall columns, displaying the Acts of Mercy in the closed state, and three scenes each from the lives of St John the Baptist and St Lawrence in the open state. It is suggested that two missing acts, tending the sick and visiting the imprisoned were shown at the top of the wings. The centre of the altarpiece was probably a painted or a sculpted shrine

06024-6joseph.jpg	This painting has a pendant, Jacob punishing Joseph (private collection)made by Nicolaes de Helt Stockade in the same year, 1655. It is unclear how De Bray and De Helt Stockade came to make pendants; the partnership may have ben brought about by an Amsterdam client.De Brays picture illustrates one of the last episodes of the Old Testament story of Joseph, in which it transpires that his father's interpretation of the dream was correct. The elderly Jacob, who reached the age of 130, took his family to Egypt to see his son Joseph, viceroy to the pharaoh, for the last time in his life. He had sent another son, Judah, to announce the family's arrival. Joseph prepared his chariot at once and set off to meet Jacob in Goshen. On seeing his father he embraced him and wept.In the painting, Jacob's entire family bows down before Joseph, who stands on the right guarded by soldiers with halberds. The chariot in which he rode to meet his father - depicted here as a seventeenth-century carriage - is visible in the background.

19452-eucharis.jpg	Religious flower still-lifes are a special category, first developed by the Fleming Daniel Seghers, a pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder. While Dutch paintings of flowers, particularly tulips, clearly showed a tendency towards secularization (with noticeable emphasis on the economic and aesthetic value of flowers rather than their religious significance, Seghers tried to recover their spiritual symbolism, in accordance with the counter-reformational aims the Jesuit order.Apart from the Virgin Mary, Seghers and his pupils had a preference for Eucharistic motifs. They particularly enjoyed painting arrangements of garlands around a niche in a wall in brown hues, showing a communion chalice with a host suspended above it. The host has a mysterious luminescent quality which emphasized the process of transubtantiation (the changing of bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus). This subject was painted especially frequently by Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who was born in Utrecht but spent a considerable amount of time in Antwerp.Like Seghers, de Heem succeeded in adding a phosphorescent luminosity to his garlands, which also have an enamel-like clarity about them and richly colourful nuances. In his Eucharistic motifs they consist of fruit - particularly grapes - and bundles of grain, as well as apples, pears, figs and maize. The human eye can hardly appreciate the infinitely delicate precision of the tender, thread-like stems and little twigs winding around the jumble of the painstakingly detailed fruits. The Eucharist had a particularly prominent place in the Catholic Counter-Reformation, as a response to the Protestant doctrine that bread and wine merely had a symbolic value during communion

19786-dianacal.jpg	The mythological subject of this painting is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Diana's nymphs were expected to be as chaste as the goddess herself. One of them, Callisto, was seduced by Jupiter who first disguised himself as Diana in order to gain the nymphs presence. In Diana and Callisto, the unfortunate Callisto is shown being stripped by her companions at the command of the chaste goddess Diana to reveal her pregnancy. Banished for her shameful state, Callisto was transformed into a bear by Jupiter's jealous wife Juno, but was later immortalised by him as the constellation of the Great Bear.Hoet's refined technique is visible in his delicate style of painting and bears resemblance to the Leiden fijnschilders of the period. Although the size of the Colnaghi-Bernheimer painting is relatively small, Hoet manages to create a lively interaction between the figures and their setting and the composition is supplemented by Italianate architectural ruins which are visible in the background

13335-1open.jpg	"The most famous work of Jan van Eyck is a huge Ghent Altarpiece with many scenes in the city of Ghent. It is said to have been begun by Jan's elder brother Hubert, of whom little is known, and was completed by Jan in 1432. On the frame a quatrain is inscribed which states that the polyptych was begun by Pictor Hubertus Eyck, and finished by his brother Jan, at the request of Jodocus Vijd, deputy burgomaster of Ghent, warden of the church of St John, and of his wife, Elisabeth Borluut, who commissioned it. The verse was placed there when the altarpiece was installed on 6 May 1432.The stylistic analysis reveals that in the painting the work of two different hands can be clearly discerned. The overall conception of the altarpiece is the work of Hubert, along with the execution of certain parts, such as the panels in the lower tier. Here, the manner is archaic, and reflects the continuing dominance of the international style that was practised by Broederlam. The composition is typically unoriginal: the landscape is still conceived as a distant background, with which the figures at the front have no organic relation, an effect that is reinforced by the bird's eye point of view.This polyptych is mystical, not to say esoteric, in intention, and is imbued throughout with both spiritual and intellectual signification. When opened, it represents the communion of saints, which is ""the new heaven and the new earth"", in the words of the Revelation of St John. Thus the central panel of the lower tier portrays the saints symbolizing the eight Beatitudes gathered round the altar where the sacrifice of the Lamb is taking place, at the centre of the heavenly garden which has sprung from His blood.To left and right, in the foreground, are two processions facing one another. One of these is made up of the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, and the other of figures from the New Testament. Some of them are kneeling, barefoot. Behind them is assembled the hierarchy of the Church - popes, deacons and bishops, wearing sumptuous jewelry and clothes in the bright red of martyrdom. In the background are two further groups, facing each other as if they had just emerged from the surrounding shrubbery. These are, on one side, the Confessors of the Faith, tightly packed together and almost all dressed in blue; and on the other side, the Virgin Martyrs, holding out palm fronds and wearing in their hair crowns of flowers of a kind traditionally worn by young girls at certain holy ceremonies. In the middle of the panel, around the altar where the Lamb spills forth his blood, angels kneel, holding the emblems of His Passion. Grace is symbolized by a radiant dove hovering in the sky, and eternal life is represented by a fountain in the foreground. A paradisiacal landscape runs across all five lower panels, uniting them in a single composition. It is strewn with plants from different countries and flowers of different seasons. The central panel is vibrant with green, while those to the sides are more arid and rocky. The horizon sits high in the frame and is closed off by groves of trees, behind which clusters of fairy-tale buildings can be made out, representing the heavenly Jerusalem.The community of saints also extends onto the side panels. Magnificently arrayed horsemen, representing the Soldiers of Christ, are followed by the Just Judges. Opposite them are the Holy Hermits who have renounced the world, and the Pilgrim Saints, who were favourite figures of identification throughout the Middle Ages. They are led by a giant of a man, St Christopher. Many later commentators have suggested that his great height would have reminded the contemporary viewer of Jodocus Vijd's brother, also called Christopher. In the middle of the upper tier is God Almighty, the Word, essence and origin of the universe. He is dressed in red and is crowned with a magnificent tiara. On his left is Mary and on his right, St John the Baptist. These central figures are surrounded by angels who are singing or playing instruments. At the far right and left of the composition respectively are the figures of Adam and Eve. They were painted by Jan Van Eyck, and are set into trompe-l'oeil niches. Light and shadow play delicately over their forms which stand out as though they had been sculpted in the round."

21490-s_ursula.jpg	Painted by Lanfranco at the commission of Giacomo Simonelli, this painting decorated Simonelli's family chapel which was dedicated to Saint Ursula. In 1630 the church, Santa Marta in Vaticano, was destroyed to clear space for the construction of the Vatican's Palazzo del Governatorato. A date of 1622 was proposed for the picture on the basis of stylistic analogies with Lanfranco's Saint Margherita of Cortona, signed and dated by the artist in 1622 (Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence). The Saint Ursula does not belong to the most refined and elegant phase of Lanfranco's career (1618-20), but rather to a slightly later phase of around 1622-24. This protobaroque period for Lanfranco is characterized by a more robust and vigorous style that is a prelude to the artist's full baroque work of 1624-25.In the same years Lanfranco also carried out another work for the Simonelli family at Santa Marta, an altarpiece similar in typology and style to the Saint Ursula. Showing the Virgin and Child and Saints James and Anthony Abbot, the painting is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna

32783-23connes.jpg	Before his arrival in Florence, Raphael had already had occasion to compose small-scale devotional icons of the Madonna and Child, linked to a taste for the versions created by Perugino. An interesting sequence of this type can be seen in several examples, all from around 1502 to 1504, built on the motif of the Madonna holding a book. They are known as the Solly Madonna (in Berlin), the Norton Simon Madonna (in California) and the Conestabile Madonna (in St. Petersburg).The painting was a gift of the Conestabile family of Perugia to the Russian tzaress in 1871. When transferring to canvas at the end of the last century it was discovered that originally instead of the book there was a pomegranate in the hands of the Madonna. The landscape of the background with snow-capped peaks deserves a particular attention.Raphael met the challenge of creating a round composition when he painted this delicate Madonna. He provides a stable structure for the round picture by means of the vertical figure of the Madonna and the horizontal lines of the landscape. The Madonna's head is gently inclined and the contour of her left hand flows rhythmically into the outline of the Christ Child's body, thus responding to the circular form

27171-i_landsc.jpg	Under Louis XIV, the two main landscape painter of the time were Pierre Patel and Francisque Millet. They were largely derivative in their styles, but this was the secret of their success. Both of them are relatively little known today.Francisque Millet was more talented than Patel, though his present reputation is also obscure. Flemish in origin like Philippe de Champaigne, he worked mainly in Paris, specializing in classical landscapes inspired by the works of Dughet and Poussin. Millet had imagination and good powers of observation, but he never painted anything without a classical format. Millet preferred an intense blue for his landscapes (as did Poussin), which gives then an unnatural air.The ideal landscape in Budapest characterizes well the style of this French painter of Flemish origin

39646-4vendra.jpg	Returning to Venice from Rome in 1546 Titian created a remarkable group portrait of the male members of the Vendramin. Here he domesticizes official work such as Bellini's votive portrait of Doge Agostino Barbarigo as well as frescoes he had seen in the papal apartments in Rome. While the painting has the look of an impromptu gathering, it is rooted  in prestigious models that betray political motives on the part of Titian and the Vendramin.Titian adapted elements such as the steps, massive altar and flickering candles from Raphael's Mass of Bolsena as a suitably impressive setting for the Vendramin family's adoration of a reliquary of a fragment of the True Cross. Although the relic was owned by the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, the Vendramin family was closely associated with it: one of their ancestors had donated the relic to the Scuola, and an Andrea Vendramin, namesake of Titian's patron, was famous for having rescued it when it fell into a canal. Titian suggests the intimacy of the family's relation to the relic by placing the current head of family (also named Andrea) in the centre of the composition, with one hand on the altar as he looks out of the picture, inviting the viewer's participation. At the left two other family members, dressed in senatorial red, pay their eloquent devotion to the relic, the middle-aged man reaching out as if to share his adoration with others. Titian records and contrasts the emotions of his subjects; the sober obedience of the adolescents at left and the innocent play of the children at right serve to underscore the maturity and depth of the adults' piety, as civic, as well as personal virtue.Titian is supposed to have said a painter only needed three colours: white, black and red. Looking at this painting, one may well believe it

Nothing appears to have occurred between 1330 and 1380 to render Giotto's prototype out of date: the latter painting reveals no startling new approach.

The white carnation, which one would normally have expected to be red as the symbol of love, adds to the sober mood. Although there are no traces of hinges, it is not impossible that this little work had a separate man's portrait as its pendant. The meaning of the white carnation is unclear.

17258-auvers18.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 789, JH 2006.In this painting the church in Auvers has been transformed by the artist into a vision using form and colour. Painted in portrait format, the church towers up before the onlooker like a fortification. The path leading to it forks in the foreground into two narrow paths passing the church on either side. On the path to the left, her back turned toward us, a peasant woman is walking into the distance. The path is bathed in light, while the church is viewed against the backdrop of a dark blue sky that merges with the black-blue of the night sky at the edges of the picture. The brushwork is restless and full of movement, and the forms of the church are distorted in the Expressionist manner

10397-03adamev.jpg	This depiction by Lucas Cranach the Younger of the founders of the human race was part of a tradition in the Cranach workshop that spanned many decades. Lucas Cranach the Elder had produced a number of variants from 1509 onwards. Apart from small-sized versions on panel, we know of life-size pairs of paintings also by Lucas Cranach the Elder. Albrecht D�rer's first independent formulations of this theme in 1504 and 1507 were certainly the inspiration for Cranach's work on the subject. But unlike D�rer, Cranach was less interested in Antiquity and classical proportions, and operated rather within north Alpine traditions that were strongly influenced by Burgundian-Dutch forms.Cranach's fundamental principle of varying individual motifs is illustrated in his depictions of Adam and Eve. Not only the posture and the vocabulary of gestures, but also the positioning of the fig-leaves, the background design and the representations of the animals can be found in either similar or identical form in the various versions that came from the Cranach workshop. The method of combining individual components to produce a striking overall impression gives a special quality to the Cranachs' works, which are never mere copies of previous designs

10654-10csont.jpg	"The angular figure of the Saviour is standing in the middle isolated from everything and everybody. He is raising up his hands  as if praying or preaching. The group of the twelve  apostles are looking out of the picture. Dr. Rezs� Pertorini, author of the Csontv�ry pathogaph, grouped them as people shouting, ""Crucify him,"" as if they were a choir in a Greek tragedy. Faces are suggestive, those of the Saviour and Moses are expressive.The picture condenses events. Moses is standing with stone tablets on the left. The silhouette of a town can be seen in the background, it is Jerusalem. On the right, there is a slim tree with a block of stone at its foot with two black figures tumbling on it. Behind the tree, there is a modern church which is lit: it can be approached on a steep slope. Next to it, there are three columns with winged sculptures and a domed building on the left. A group of people are approaching the church. The picture has a complicated and symbolic message, in fact, the painter attempted to sum up the history of christianity. He portrayed the Old Testament on the left and the New Testament on the right: the former  being represented by Moses and the tables of the Testament, and the New Testament by Jesus' sermon, payer, and desciples, the tree symbolizing the cross, and the mourners with a stone suggesting a grave.There are symbolic objects and scenes on both sides. The  background stretches out to the distance. Thus, the painter emphasizes the main characters. The composition is balanced. The connection between time and space, and the suggestivity of tools with expressive power are in  harmony with one another"

05673-adoratio.jpg	Boucher had never been a committed artistic believer. Although he had worked in Italy, the Italian tradition did not tempt him into vast imaginative schemes. He never aimed at a heroic vision. He expressed no glorious promises about heaven: either as an Olympian refuge for aristocratic families, or in ordinary Christian terms.

28916-contarin.jpg	The reputation of Moroni of Bergamo rests primarily on his numerous portraits although, like his master, Moretto da Brescia, he also painted altarpieces and religious compositions. His models were, for the most part, the patricians, bourgeois scholars and artisans living in the small towns of Northern Italy. Usually he painted them at work with the tools of their particular trade: the scholar is seen holding a book or writing implements, the tailor is about to cut his cloth.According to a later inscription at the top right, this is a portrait of Jacopo Contarini, Podesta of Padua. However, Padua never had a Podesta of this name and, since it is known that Jacopo Foscarini filled that office when the picture was painted, we can only assume that the inscription is inaccurate and that the portrait is indeed of Foscarini. He is shown as a distinguished man of middle age with an air of seriousness that commands respect. Only the serene harmony of greys and reds resolves the sombre mood of the painting

05308-31right.jpg	The right wing represents St Anthony in Meditation.The powerful evocation of a corrupt and stinking world is no less apparent in the right wing, where Bosch used as his starting point the story of the Devil-Queen, a subject he had already depicted in the Hermit Saints altarpiece. The Devil-Queen appears in the river before Anthony, shielding her private parts with a false modesty and surrounded by her infernal court. Anthony averts his eyes from this obscene group only to be summoned by a demon-herald to the devilish feast in the foreground. The open-air table, the cloth slung tent-like over the tree stump beside the temptress, and the servants pouring wine seem like a grotesque parody of the traditional Garden of Love. In the background looms the city of the Devil-Queen, its demonic nature betrayed by the dragon swimming in the moat and by the flames erupting from the top of the main gate

42128-09casafl.jpg	This fresco is part of the paintings decorating the house of Vasari in Florence.It is characteristic of Vasari's self-confidence that the artistic and intellectual effort he invested in designing his own home was comparable to that which he expended on the residences of those who commissioned his work. He decorated his house in Arezzo between 1542 and 1548; toward the end of his life he also frescoed his Florentine house, which had been given to him by Duke Cosimo I in 1561.

34263-gregory.jpg	"Ricci was an exuberant personality, internationally renowned and an archetypal ""traveling"" painter. After training in the Veneto, Ricci spent some time in Emilia (Bologna, Parma and Piacenza). This proved crucial to his development as his style was influenced by the local classicism, deepened when Ricci made a trip to Rome, where Annibale Carraci's frescos in Palazzo Farnese deeply moved him. After a brief trip to Vienna, Ricci went back to Venice in 1708, where his art changed. His Altarpiece of St Gregory the Great was a deliberate homage to Paolo Veronese and inaugurated a totally new era in eighteenth-century Venetian painting, trying to revive the glories of its Renaissance. Compared to his earlier works, his art was now remarkably free in composition and brushwork. This new style of painting was an immediate success. By 1711 Sebastiano had joined his nephew Marco Ricci in London where he remained for five years, working for many great noblemen."

42738-mazeppa1.jpg	Vernet's oil study Mazeppa of 1826, done in advance of the large painting in the Mus�e Calvet in Avignon, was based on a theme from Lord Byron's verse epic of the same name, which was translated into French soon after its publication in 1819. The story relates how Mazeppa, a Cossack chief, made illicit advances to the daughter of a Polish prince. As punishment, he was tied naked to the back of a wild horse, which galloped off with him. Exhausted to the point of death, he was finally saved by a Cossack girl.Mazeppa not only represents a man whose animal instincts caused him to be subjected to an animal fate; he also embodies the outcast and pariah who is condemned by society. In this regard, Mazeppa could figure as a romantic symbol of artistic self-reliance and determination

44528-federi06.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.Zandomeneghi settled in Paris in 1874, living a reclusive life, and, unsuccessful in his lifetime, was obliged to earn a living doing fashion drawings. He exhibited in the 1879, 1881, and 1886 Impressionist exhibitions. In street scenes such as Place d'Anvers, Paris his brushwork was relaxed and sketchy

09537-lastjudg.jpg	In Munich in 1836 Cornelius received a major commission to decorate the altar wall of the Ludwigskirche with the fresco of the Last Judgment. Basically it is oriented to Michelangelo's fresco in the Sistine Chapel, but is easily half as big again, so it is now the largest fresco in the world. It proved fatal for Cornelius. The individual elements simply would not resolve into a unified composition. Cornelius was overwhelmed with criticism as soon as the painting was finished, and there were acrimonious disputes with King Ludwig I of Bavaria.

35423-43religi.jpg	Religious flower still-lifes are a special category, first developed by the Fleming Daniel Seghers, a pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder. However, this can be traced back to Rubens's Madonna in Floral Wreath (with the collaboration of Jan Brueghel the Elder). This represents a picture within a picture with an authoritative religious significance, encircled by a floral arrangement and cherubs. Unlike Seghers, however, Rubens did not quote Mary and Jesus as historical traditions or pictorial relics. Instead he preferred to give the impression that they were physically present, even though the motif of a picture within a picture would have been ideally suited for illusionist stylization.This painting is a good example of the encounter of talents of Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder, one much appreciated by collectors. Each exhibits his own virtuosity, Rubens painting the figures and Brueghel the floral decoration

32334-02ignazi.jpg	"This spectacular composition is almost an inventory of Baroque architectural ceilings and their final triumph. According to Jesuit ideas, the space within a church was a single area in which the faithful congregated. In Sant'Ignazio space is stretched (Pozzo was clever at the illusion of ""doubling"" the perspective of the real architecture) before exploding into light and glory. Saints, angels, allegories, and floating clouds accentuate the virtuoso effect. The impression is one of exuberance and freedom. In reality, it was worked out using scientific criteria.Designed to be viewed from a point in the centre of the nave, which is marked by a white stone, Padre Pozzo's ceiling produces the illusion of a palace opening on the sky."

14348-jesusdoc.jpg	Following the restoration of Spanish rule and Catholic worship in Antwerp in 1585, the city fathers ordered the crafts and guilds to reinstall their altars in the Cathedral. Among the first to respond were the Schoolmasters and the Soap-boilers, who shared an altar in the church. They contracted Frans Francken to paint a triptych showing Jesus among the Doctors. (The left wing depicts St Ambrose Baptising St Augustine, while the right wing the Miracle of the Flowing Oil.)The scenes plainly have most to do with the schoolmasters. The centre panel shows the episode from St Luke's Gospel in which the twelve-year-old Jesus debates theology with the Jewish scribes in the Temple at Jerusalem. His parents, who have found him after a long search, look somewhat dejected. The Temple is represented by a Renaissance church interior with a menorah and the Ark of the Covenant in the background.The left wing shows Ambrose, the patron saint of Antwerp's schoolmasters, baptising St Augustine in the presence of a canon-scholaster and several council members from the Schoolmasters' Guild. The only reference to the Soap-boilers is in the right wing, where the Bible story of the Miracle of the Flowing Oil is depicted. The prophet Elisha helped the widow of Zarephath out of debt by causing her oil jug to continuously replenish itself - an appropriate theme, for oil was one of the ingredients used by the soap-boilers.The style of the triptych is sober and didactic, as befits the schoolmasters, if not the soapmakers. The balanced composition with its symmetrically arranged groups and the restrained presentation of the principal theme, without many secondary scenes or symbols, is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, the latest artistic trend at the time

The two were to journey to Panama and Martinique together the following year. Gauguin's role as mentor is alluded to in the way in which Laval gazes fixedly at the ceramic pot which was made by Gauguin in the winter of 1886-87, when he worked in Paris with the ceramicist Chaplet.The still-life with its piled up fruits, treated with tight diagonal brushstrokes and laid out on a white cloth, is reminiscent of C�zanne's painting Still-Life with Compotier which Gauguin owned at this date.

39772-01bluesl.jpg	The biographer Giorgio Vasari, in his Life of Titian, describes a similar portrait which he says could easily have been mistaken for a Giorgione if Titian had not signed it. This portrait was erroneously identified by early critics as the portrait of Ariosto; it is perhaps a likeness of Titian's earliest patron, a member of the noble Barbarigo family. In his early period, Titian's portraits are strongly realistic. The painting in its gripping tonal palpability and attention to detail, such as the stitching in the satin, has much in common with Giorgione's late portraits. But Titian, somewhat competitively, carries Giorgione's realism a step further in the way the sleeve billows out and invades our space, extending the boundaries of Giorgionismo in a burst of hyperrealism. The sitter's expression is arrogant, typical of the male dandy. The figure stands out in bold relief against the plain background and the colour emphasizes the unusual lighting, revealing the mood of the sitter as well as capturing his physical presence

The hands, too, which only stick out over the frame with the tops of the fingers, are inspired by Memling.Formerly it was considered to be an early Memling, but today the portrait is no longer accepted as an autograph work. The disproportion between head and body and the lack of fine detail suggest a minor master. In the stiff tubular fingers and heavy thumb there is a hint of the manner of the Lucy Master. Moreover, the powerful features and the rough, somewhat vulgar expression with widely separated eyes also seem to fit this master's typology

40732-13icon.jpg	"The central idea of this image, whose eastern Christian iconography can be traced back to the high middle ages, consists in the representation of the Savior's triumph over death and over the evil forces of Satan, as celebrated in the Easter troparion of the Byzantine liturgy: ""Christ is risen from the dead, by his death he has vanquished death, and to those who were in their tombs he has given life.""The present icon represents, at the centre, Christ in glory, resplendent in a burst of golden light. He is placed within an azure mandorla, graduated in tone and hatched with golden rays. Treading upon the gates of hell, which have been thrown off their hinges and flung to the ground, Christ is flanked by two groups of personages: they are the Just of the Old Covenant, prominent among whom are the figures of King David (with the crown), Moses, and Saint John the Baptist. In the persons of Adam and Eve, rising from their tombs in the form of sarcophagi, the whole of humanity is here being won and redeemed.Based on its characteristics this icon may be related to the Byzantine school of Veliko Tarnova of the late seventeenth century"

15524-1expuls.jpg	The narration of the story of Mary on the left wall of the chapel starts at the bottom at the entrance to the chapel with the Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple.In the centre of the loggia with broad round arches and built on a cross-shaped ground plan, a high priest is receiving sacrificial lambs at the altar where a fire is burning. As the old Joachim does not yet have any descendants, he is not allowed to take part in the sacrificial rite, and is sent away. Symmetrical groups of Florentine citizens frame this biblical scene, and in the group on the right, the artist has depicted himself and some members of his family.This episode follows the traditional lines of composition. Of significance here is the architecture, which the artist obviously felt was more important than the events. In the upper half of the painting it takes up more space than the figures, who occupy only the bottom part of the picture. The most important figures - and not only the biblical ones - are standing at the front edge of the picture. All the other scenes follow this basic principle.In the background, Ghirlandaio's depiction of the widely spaced loggia and its medallions is a direct quotation of the Spedale degli Innocenti, the foundling hospital in Florence designed by Brunelleschi. Interestingly enough, there is a repetition of this fa�ade, constructed shortly after Ghirlandaio's frescoes were painted, that can be seen when leaving the church of Santa Maria Novella at the other end of the piazza by the Spedale di San Paolo (built 1489 -1498).Above the portraits are two palaces whose lines run parallel with those of the temple. Comparable buildings, with rusticated lower stories and open upper stories, largely characterize the appearance of Florence to this day. This was one way in which Ghirlandaio repeatedly brought the city into his paintings.Contemporaries of the artist and clients are present as spectators and witnesses of the expulsion of Joachim, and because of their fashionable clothing and shoes and their vain hairstyles they differ conspicuously from the biblical participants. It is thought that the noblemen on the left include the client's son, Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and his friend Piero, the son of Lorenzo de' Medici. In the group at the right Ghirlandaio depicts famous contemporary artists (including himself) who can be identified from the description of Vasari as Alesso Baldovinetti, Bastiano Mainardi, Davide and Domenico Ghirlandaio.

42271-0606vela.jpg	In a manner that is always striking and sometimes curiously moving to modern observers, Vel�zquez shows human nature in all its diversity when he presents the gallery of dwarfs and jesters who lived at court and whose task it was to preserve the king from boredom in the midst of routine etiquette.Under cover of joking, the court jesters or buffoons, in Spanish truhanes, would often tell their lords and masters the home truths openly discussed by the ordinary people. They could move freely in the king's presence, trying to amuse the naturally melancholic Philip IV with their caustic remarks. To judge by their salaries, their position in society was quite high. Vel�zquez himself, on entering the service of the palace as a court painter, had at first been classed with the royal servants, and as a result shared the life of these truhanes.Vel�zquez painted a masterly picture of the buffoon Don Crist�bal de Casta&#241;eda y Pernia, who was first in rank among the court jesters. He gave himself airs as a great military expert, thus earning the nickname of Barbarroja (Barbarossa or Red-beard). The ambitious buffoon aspired to military roles and he even acted as toreador in the arena although he was ill-fitted for doing it. His red robe is almost Turkish in style, and his head-dress suggests a fool's cap. He glares fiercely into space, and while he grips the sheath of his sword firmly, the sword itself is held in a relaxed position

37293-32madonn.jpg	The two Madonnas in the Siena Pinacoteca, one from Castiglione d'Orcia and the other from Lucignano d'Arbia, are clearly related and must date from more or less the same period. But we have no dates, no signatures and no documents containing any information at all regarding the dating of these works: stylistic analysis is the only element that critics have been able to use. This justifies the widely varying opinions that have been expressed on the subject: some scholars believe that they are totally autograph, while others think that Simone is responsible only for the drawings or for certain sections of the painting, while others still consider them entirely the work of the workshop assistants.Nonetheless, there are many analogies between the various paintings from this period, such as for example, the features of the Madonna in the San Domenico Polyptych, with her gentle and slightly dreaming eyes, repeated almost exactly in the Madonna in the Orvieto Polyptych; or the lively pose of the Child in the panel from Castiglione d'Orcia which is exactly the same as that of the Child in the Boston painting

29493-drawingl.jpg	Van der Neer's first pictures date to the 1660s, the decade in which Dou, Frans van Mieris, Gerard Terborch, and Gabriel Metsu were at the height of their careers, working in a flourishing market awash with disposable income. Van der Neer's paintings from this early period, among them his Lady Drawing of about 1665, clearly resembles these masters' works. Its subject can be linked to a work by Metsu while the lady's shimmering satin attire and the overall, serene ambience of the panel strongly recall paintings by Terborch.The Lady Drawing is probably not meant to represent a professional woman artist at work but rather a female member of the upper classes practicing drawing. Daughters of elite families were sometimes taught the rudiments of art (which could encompass drawing, painting, or even calligraphy), along with music and poetry in order to enhance their standing in society, particularly among respectable suitors

04069-vastato.jpg	The picture shows the choir vault and apse with illusionistic architecture and scenes from the life of the Virgin (Annunciation, Assumption).The most important setting for the fictive dissolution of ceilings and walls with painting intended to evoke and illustrate heavenly sphere was the church, with its choir tribunes, inner fa�ades, vaults and cupolas. The new type of the hall church evolved following the prototype of the Il Ges&#249; in Rome, and offered fresco painters an ideal space to work in. The vaulted, single-aisle nave flanked by chapels, transepts flooded by light from the centre cupola, and a spacious choir made possible a sophisticated structuring of the pictorial program in conformity with the architecture.The painterly redecoration of the church of Santissima Annunziata del Vastato in Genoa following its modernization in the style of the Counter-Reformation began around 1625 with the vaults of the aisles.  The painting of the choir by Giulio Benso began in 1635, and there are staged the most important events of the life of the Virgin as a theatrical spectacle. The Annunciation to the Virgin, central to the church's iconography, takes place in the vault, shifted to heavenly spheres with the help of quadratura. The drama of the Annunciation - Mary receives the angel's message in an airy loggia, while God floats down in glory above her - is then outdone by the ecstasy of the choir calotte's Assumption.This theatrical staging is considered one of the most successful combinations, with respect to foreshortening of quadratura and figural painting with the actual architecture

00221-oratory.jpg	The oratory at the west edge of the city centre of Urbino was erected c. 1393. Nothing is known about the commissioning of the paintings on the walls, a cycle depicting scenes from the life of St John the Baptist. The unidentified patron was probably from Rome from where the Salimbeni brothers, Lorenzo and Jacopo, came to Urbino for this commission. Stylistic analysis tells us that another painter was also engaged for the wall frescoes in the oratory. Antonio Alberti was responsible for the scenes from the St John cycle on the left-hand wall and on the inner fa�ade.The picture shows the view of the left-hand (east) long wall of the oratory with fragments of the St John cycle in the upper register. The scenic compartments are considered to be the work of Antonio Alberti.The lower register of the east wall includes several votive pictures, separately framed but also painted on the wall, that must have been executed at roughly the same time as the cycle. The two votive paintings with an enthroned Madonna and saints were painted by the Salimbeni brothers.

Subsequent sale Amsterdam, 1696, no. 4: ""A young lady playing the guitar, very good, of the same; fl 70."" Collection 2d Viscount Palmerston; collection W. Cowper-Temple at Broadland, later Baron Mount-Temple, 1871; art gallery Thos. Agnew, London, 1888. Acquired by the Earl Iveagh, 1889.An old copy, canvas, 48,7 x 41,2 cm, is in the Museum of Art, Philadelphia. The only difference separating this copy from the Kenwood, London, version is the coiffure of the guitar player, whose style points toward c. 1700. It would be interesting to clean this painting and possibly ascertain, by X-rays, whether the original coiffure is still extant and was overpainted at a later date. Otherwise, both paintings are almost equal as far as pictorial quality is concerned.Together with the Lacemaker (Louvre, Paris), this painting constitutes one of the best achievements by Vermeer, and certainly a towering success in his late maturity. By now, the artist had attained the mastery of light and colours, together with complete freedom of expressing himself technically by means of looser brushstrokes that are no longer bound to specifics of texture or materials. The model is not drawn inward but looks to the outside world in full communication and radiance of her pleasure simply to make music. Never was Vermeer more able to liberate himself from all constraints and convey his artistic viewpoint in a more masterly manner. The landscape on the back wall seems to be painted in the style of Hackaert"

18765-guard307.jpg	The division between quay and water and the human activity around the market stalls and gondolas make up the theme of this view of the Molo. The quay, which is provided with steps and jetties for mooring boats, creates a striking line in the composition running almost at a right angle to the lower edge of the image and leads the eye toward a vanishing point just below the middle of the painting. Depicted at the right is the column of Todaro beyond which the buildings along the Molo continue with the Library, the Zecca and the State Grain Storage Houses all the way to the Fonteghetto della Farina near the entrance of the Grand Canal. A market with simple stalls and awnings occupies the Fondaco del Grano. To the left of the entrance of the Grand Canal can be seen the Punta della Dogana and Santa Maria della Salute and in the distance, to the extreme left, the Redentore. The composition is closed off at this end by a fishing boat which counterbalances the column of Todaro. As several corrections by the painter, visible to the naked eye reveal, Guardi modified the strong perspective of the buildings at the right and moved the Salute closer to the centre of the composition.The view of the Molo in the direction of the entrance to the Grand Canal was a subject frequently depicted in Venetian vedute painting. Initially the view functioned primarily as a setting for festive entries in the Doges' Palace, such as in Luca Carlevaris's Reception of Cardinal Cesar d'Estrees (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Later the view of the Molo was usually shown without the Doges' Palace and without any kind of festivity.For this painting, Guardi undoubtedly drew inspiration from a work by Canaletto (c. 1740, private collection) which he may have known through a print by Antonio Visentini from 1742. Not only did Guardi rely on this for his composition, he also borrowed several details from Canaletto such as the little stalls on the Molo and the gondolas floating on the water. However, a comparison with this source makes it clear that Guardi, despite the strong perspectival arrangement of this composition, neither subjected the cityscape to a strict perspectival system nor strove for an exact, detailed rendering of the architecture. For the loosely, vigorously painted figures on the Molo, Guardi more likely found an example in the work of the Genoese painter, Alessandro Magnasco. Furthermore, Guardi's painting is not even half the size of the one by Canaletto.Guardi's small painting and its pendant, a view of the Piazzetta in the direction of San Giorgio Maggiore (also in the Galleria Franchetti, Venice), no longer satisfied the presumably more representative function of Canaletto's painting, but were purchased instead by an individual client who was as interested in the well-known Venetian cityscapes as in Guardi's painterly rendering of them.As with many of Francesco Guardi's paintings, the dating of this work is problematic. It no longer displays the strong stylistic dependence on Canaletto which is characteristic of his earliest cityscapes, nor the brown tonality of his work from the 1760s. The shimmering effects of light and colour, especially in the wall surfaces of the buildings, and the nervous treatment of the sky and the figures on the Molo are characteristic of Guardi's extremely individualistic, transparent style in the last two decades of his career. Therefore, dating this painting to the second half of the 1770s seems plausible

Both painting follow the scheme used for representing the toilette of Venus. Bathsheba is identified only by the barely visible spying figure in the Budapest painting and by the figure of a maid approaching with a letter from King David.Apparently Ricci liked to use buildings with columns to close up the background, no doubt inspired by Veronese. Slender columns, light, almost floating balconies provide a picturesquely decorative framework for the figures grouped on the stage in front. The whole scene is pervaded by a shimmering silvery light; shadow and dimness have vanished completely; the painter applies light and colour for modelling.

25047-altar1.jpg	The Master of the Holy Blood was a Bruges follower of Quentin Massys and he takes his name from a triptych in the Holy Blood Museum in Bruges, which formed the nucleus around which his oeuvre has been reconstructed. This triptych in the Groeninge Museum - displayed in the original frame - is one of his best surviving altarpieces.The main scene represents a Rest on the Flight into Egypt in which the seated Virgin with the Child on her lap is accompanied by St Catherine, who as Christ's bride receives the symbolic ring, and St Barbara who holds a peacock's feather in her hand. It is a rather exceptional combination of the biblical theme with that of the Virgo inter Virgines. There is an echo of Memling in both the general layout as a triptych and the composition of the main scene, which is remotely reminiscent of the St John altarpiece (Memlingmuseum, Bruges).In the middle ground of the rocky landscape three angels are picking figs (a `poetic' variant of the palm-tree miracle) and on the right walks Joseph, perhaps taking the figs to Mary, who indeed holds a fig in her left hand. The donors on the wings, protected respectively by St Joachim and St Judocus, were identified as Joachim Christiaens, orator of the deanery in Bruges (regularly mentioned between 1535 and 1552) and city councillor (in 1530, 1534, 1536 and 1544), and his second wife Jossine Lamsins. In the background of the three panels small scenes are depicted from the legend of the saints in the foreground. On the left wing at the level of the founder's head is the Preaching of St John the Baptist, a scene connected with the patron saint of the former donor. Above this on the hill is the Annunciation to Joachim, which was added later. Behind St Catherine, on the far left next to the rocks, is her martyrdom with the wheel and the heavenly lightning. Behind St Barbara in front of the rocks is the shepherd with his flock who will betray Barbara's hideaway in the rocks to her father. He is shown talking to Barbara's father, while in the scene above Barbara is being threatened by her father in the cave. The pilgrim begging for alms in the right wing at the back is connected with the story of St Judocus.The exterior features an Annunciation in grisaille on a red marbled background.The triptych, which dates from around 1520-25, is the first work by this anonymous master to be found in which donor figures appear, and since it is clearly of Bruges origin, there can be no more doubt about his being active in Bruges.Joachim Christiaens died in 1552 and Jossine Lamsins in 1557. They were both buried by St Michael's altar on the south side of St Donatian's Cathedral, which was probably also the original destination of the triptych

07263-canal713.jpg	Northumberland House at Charing Cross was the London residence of the Earl of Northumberland, who commissioned Canaletto to paint this picture. The house had recently been inherited and refashioned, and Canaletto concentrated his attention on its elegant and mellow fa�ade. The impressive appearance of the building is enhanced by its towers which are surmounted by gilt weather vanes, and the row of obelisks that support lamps on the pavement before it. The house was eventually demolished in 1873, making way for Northumberland Avenue, and the lion above the doorway was then moved to Syon House in Isleworth, Middlesex, where it can still be seen.Canaletto created far more than just a celebration of a particular building, however; he also provides us with an invaluable record of its surroundings, and a vivid impression of the capital coming to life early in the morning. To the right is the statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur (c. 1595-c. 1650) that now stands at the entrance of Whitehall from Trafalgar Square, and at the left is the entrance to the Strand and the Golden Cross Inn, which has a sign standing in front of it.The painting was much copied and engravings were made after it; as a result of the distribution of these copies, it was to have a significant influence on the work of English artists who depicted urban scenes

38229-arachne.jpg	"The mythological story of the contest between the goddess Athena (Minerva to the Romans) and the mortal woman Arachne was perhaps told best by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses (Book VI). According to Ovid, Arachne lived in the country of Lydia (which had a legendary reputation for producing some of the most splendid textiles in the ancient world), where she matured into one of the finest weavers ever known. Arachne was in fact so adept at weaving that she became arrogant, and claimed that her ability rivaled that of the goddess Athena.  A contest was arranged, and having been bested by the mortal Arachne, the infuriated goddess cursed the girl, turning her into a spider in punishment for her effrontery.Strozzi's depiction of Arachne is part of a group of bust length depictions of female allegorical and historical figures and of saints that he began to create early on, perhaps in response to the visit to Genoa of Simon Vouet in 1620-22.  Whatever their inspiration, Strozzi produced these beautiful ""portraits"" throughout his career, adapting his depictions to the theme at hand - refined and ethereal for his saints; sensual and seductive for his profane subjects"

21328-nicole.jpg	Leaving his poverty-stricken home at the age of 15, La Tour first entered the workshop of an etcher in Paris, then worked in the studio of the painter Jacques-Jean Spoede. With a letter of recommendation from an English ambassador he went to England where he was much impressed by van Dyck's art of portrayal. On his return to Paris he took up pastel painting, possibly inspired by Rosalba Camera's success in Paris in 1720/21. After some experiments he soon came to excel at pastel portraits, surpassing all his rivals, even Peronneau, and gaining great favour at court. La Tour was most demanding in his art so that the execution of a work was often slow, and it was nine years before he produced a work which would admit him to the Academy. His Portrait of Mme de Pompadour of 1755 (Paris, Louvre) and of the President de Rieux in his Study (Paris, Louvre) represent two of the few full-length pastel portraits in existence. His portraits show a vigourous handling and a perceptive grasp of character

14908-early10.jpg	From November 1884 to June 1885 Gauguin lived in Copenhagen with his wife and family, and it was there that he painted this self-portrait. His letters to friends in Paris chronicle what was for him a difficult period - he missed the cultural life of Paris, disliked the Danes, his wife's family in particular, and the harsh climate meant that he could do little work in the open air. Increasingly he was forced to work indoors, without a model, and his subject matter betrays these constraints. His work became increasingly premeditated. However, in the execution, particularly in the flickering brushwork, this painting is still close to the work of his Impressionist years.Gauguin's rather romantic characterization of the solitary figure labouring in a garret establishes the tenor of much later self-portraits, in which he depicted himself as artistic martyr, culminating in the series of works of 1889 in which he increasingly identified with Christ

26023-13john.jpg	The symbolic gesture whereby Jesus places a wedding ring on the finger of St Catherine of Alexandria caused this altarpiece to be identified for many years as the Mystic marriage of St Catherine. Nevertheless, it is clearly dedicated to the Virgin and the two St Johns. Together with the Gdansk Last Judgment and the L�beck Passion, this is one of the three biggest triptychs that Memling ever painted. The three altarpieces are also distributed evenly throughout his career, and hence serve as crucial milestones in the development of his oeuvre. The St John altarpiece is dated 1479, and is thus located precisely half-way between the Gdansk (1467) and L�beck (1491) triptychs.The central panel focuses upon a Sacra Conversazione, a gathering of saints around the Virgin. However, the narrow vertical openings between the columns reveal a continuous landscape with ruins and buildings in which small episodes from the lives of the two male saints are enacted. The two wings each depict episodes from the lives of the standing figures of the two St Johns on either side of the Virgin. The left wing features the Beheading of St John the Baptist and the right wing St John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos. In addition to these realistic portrayals, the carved groups on the two capitals above each saint also depict key moments from their lives.The composition of the triptych as a whole is not only ingenious in narrative terms, with the different components interlocking spatially and thematically; it is also new in many respects as far as the portrayal of the Virgin Mary in heaven and the Apocalypse are concerned. The iconographical forebears of such a grouping of saints sitting and standing around an enthroned Virgin are few and far between. The only extant examples are, in fact, the Virgo inter Virgines from the circle of the Master of Fl�malle in Washington and a similar composition, this time set in a room, by Rogier van der Weyden, several fragments of which have survive. They are not, however, comparable in formal terms. This clear monumental composition, with two symmetrical standing male saints and two sitting female saints, forming a tetramorph around the Virgin, must have seemed very new. As is the case with the architecture, Memling appears to have developed here upon Jan van Eyck's Virgin with Canon van der Paele. The Apocalypse is new too. There is no sign of any other representation prior to Memling in which the Book of Revelation is played out before St John's eyes in its entirety in a single, undivided painting. Only in the Beheading of StJohn the Baptist did Memling prefer to paraphrase a Van der Weyden composition (St John altarpiece, Berlin, Staatliche Museen). However, the stylised terseness and enclosed character of the latter give way here to dramatic action in the open air, with a high degree of realism.In view of the historical circumstances and iconography, there can be no doubt whatsoever that this triptych was painted for the High Altar of the chapel of St John's Hospital. An old inscription on the bottom member of the frame gives the date 1479 and the name of the artist Johannes Memling. With the exception of the Floreins triptych in the same hospital, this is the only work by Memling to be authenticated by an original (in this case subsequently overpainted) inscription. The donors were also identified. Jacob de Ceuninc was initially recorded as a monk at the hospital in 1469-70, and later as bursar from 1488 until his death in 1490. Antheunis Seghers was first mentioned in 1455-56 and appears to have been master from 1461 to 1465, bursar from 1466 to 1468, and then master again from 1469 until his death in 1475. Agnes Casembrood was first recorded in 1445-46, and subsequently appears as prioress from 1459 to 1463, and again from 1469 until her death in 1489. Clara van Hulsen makes her initial appearance in the records in 1427-1428, and died in 1479. Given that these are evidently intended as portraits, the altarpiece must have been ordered before the death of Antheunis Seghers in 1475, which means that its production may logically be linked with the expansion of the chapel's apse in 1473- 74 though we lack details of Jacob de Ceuninc and Clara van Hulsen in those years.The altarpiece is, of course, dedicated to the patron saints of St John's Hospital. The central portrayal of the Virgin might relate to the hospital chapel's long-standing and close links with the chapter of the almost adjacent Church of Our Lady. The two female saints, Catherine and Barbara, were frequently invoked in adversity. Their presence in the hospital context has frequently been explained in terms of their symbolising respectively the contemplative and active life of the hospital's monastic community

11324-512delac.jpg	G�ricault had inspired in Delacroix his fascination with horses, the emblematic beasts of Romantic painting. But his love of horses was fully satisfied only in Morocco. Thereafter the Arab horses that he had seen and drawn during his voyage constituted a kind of repertoire. For one of his last paintings, Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable, he drew on a scene that he had witnessed in Tangier, when the horses of Mornay and the English Consul were fighting. No anatomical studies lie behind this painting. Once again, it is the violence of the combat that he portrays; the power and energy of the animals, an effect emphasised by the strong contrasts of light and shade

It took place on June 1st 1432 in San Romano, half way between Florence and Pisa. The picture shows the conclusive combat between the captains of the two armies: Niccol&#242; da Tolentino unseating Bernardino della Ciarda.Uccello's obsession with displaying his mastery of perspective (such as the long white and red lances or the exceptional horses that have rolled over on the ground) and the dramatic nature of the clash between the knights combine with his almost magical story telling. This is underpinned by the use of unreal colours and light as if describing some fabulous tale of chivalrous adventure

20127-anaemic.jpg	Van Hoogstraten's most concentrated period of genre painting production occurred only during the last years of his career, around 1670&#151;71. These later pictures exhibit limited subject matter focusing primarily upon domestic themes. Especially fascinating is his Anaemic Lady (and its pendant of Two Women by a Cradle, dated 1670, Museum of Fine Arts, Springfield). In the Anaemic Lady a taciturn physician examines a flask containing the urine of an ailing young woman while another man (her husband?) looks on. This event takes place in a well-appointed house; the recession of space through two rooms in the background allows the viewer to scrutinize some very interesting paintings hanging on the walls and a sliver of a brilliantly illuminated gilt-leather wall-hanging. The inclusion of gilt-leather wall-hangings (an expensive decorative accouterment at this time), costly paintings, and sumptuous fabrics enhances the aura of opulence exuded by the painting

French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century.

The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene.

10233-1venus06.jpg	The provenance of this picture is unknown. It is one of a series of paintings in various sizes, representing Venus or a female nude, turned out in quantities by Cranach and his studio; these were popular among the clientele of humanists for whom he worked. However, this conception of Venus belongs to a German tradition which derives its inspiration from Gothic art. The juvenile air, the slender forms, the tiny breasts an narrow hips, the rounded forehead, all go to make up the physical characteristics of the women (including the Virgins) represented in German art since the fourteenth century. This is quite unlike the conception of D�rer's Eve (1504), which was based on an objective and scientific study of the proportions of the human body. The strange pirouetting movements of the legs, crossed over one another, occurs frequently in the engravings of Master E.S. As indicated in the romances and the books of sermons, a swaying walk was one of the ways of expressing worldly elegance for women of this Gothic world from the fourteenth century; but here this Gothic mannerism meets and contributes to another kind - the 'Mannerism' of art history. Mannerist painters and sculptors, whether Italian, German, or French, all admired what Italian aestheticians called 'la linea serpentina', which seemed to them the most beautiful of all forms.The Venus is clad only in a provocatively transparent veil; in some paintings this is a subsequent addition, but here it is original. The better to set off the ivory whiteness of her body, Cranach has shown it silhouetted against a sombre background of foliage. The landscape conveys in a few strokes an intense impression of the Germanic conception of nature.

39709-1ferra1.jpg	"In 1516 Titian made contact with Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara for whom he was to work for a decade on pictures destined for the Alabaster Chamber. In this period he painted a series of magnificent paintings of Dionysian themes: the Worship of Venus in the Prado, The Andrians (Bacchanalia), also in the Prado, and Bacchus and Ariadne, in the National Gallery, London. In these paintings Titian combines a richness of colouristic expression with a great formal elegance. These are the elements which characterize this whole so-called ""classic"" phase of Titian's development and which is dominated by the supreme masterpiece of the Frari Assumption of the Virgin.The first painting in this series is The Worship of Venus, whose subject is Love as the source of fertility and regeneration in nature. Titian's composition is based on a description by the late antique writer Philostratus, in his 'Imagines', of a painting of cupids gathering apples in the presence of Venus amid a tree-girt landscape. By basing himself on Philostratus, Titian was in effect recreating a lost masterpiece of antiquity. This would have flattered the patron, who could thus compare himself to Alexander the Great, the patron of Apelles, the most celebrated painter of the ancient world"

40245-0view.jpg	"The Salone dei Mesi (Room of Months) in the Palazzo Schifanoia, one of the masterpieces of Italian palace architecture, was decorated with a series of allegorical frescoes symbolizing the months. The length of the room  is 24 m, the width 11 m and the height 7,5 m. The frescoes are attributed to Cosm� Tura, Francesco del Cossa, Baldassare d'Este and Ercole de' Roberti.On the southern wall January and February, on the eastern wall March, April and May, on the north wall June, July, August and September, on the west wall October, November and December were represented. Due to negligence it was in a very bad state already in the 18th century. Today there remained only fragments of the frescoes on the southern and western walls, while those on the eastern wall and most on the northern are in relatively good condition. This means that the visitor can view the surviving allegories of seven months (March, April, May, June July, August and September). In all allegories the episodes are arranged in a three-tiered, frieze-like manner; in the upper sphere, the sphere of mythology, each month and its planet are paralleled by their ancient divinity in a triumphal procession. The middle layer shows the signs of the zodiac, while below are rendered the courtly events appropriate to the particular time of year.This view of the Salone dei Mesi in the Palazzo Schifanoia shows, from the left to the right, frescoes of the months of September, August, July, June, May, April, and May, respectively. The decoration was commissioned by Borso d'Este. The name Borso gave to this pleasure palace means ""away with boredom."

The sense of the mysterious and poetic that he shows in many of his works is what many call the Romantic spirit, although it was already latent in Neoclassicism.

42298-0802vela.jpg	"""Las Meninas"" is a Portuguese word used to name the Maids of Honour of the Royal children in the 17th century.Las Meninas or The Royal Family is one of the great problem pictures in the history of art. An almost infinite number of interpretations have now been proposed for the scene it shows. At first sight, however, Las Meninas seems to present no problems at all, and indeed appears perfectly straightforward in its sober geometry and good-humoured clarity.It is set in a room in the Alc�zar, equipped by Vel�zquez as a studio, and shows the heiress to the throne, the Infanta Margarita, with her court. Palomino names all those present. The queen's maid of honour, Dona Maria Agustina Sarmiento, one of the meninas, is kneeling at the Infanta's feet, handing her a jug of water. The other maid of honour, Dona Isabel de Velasco stands behind the princess, and beside her we see the grotesquely misshapen female dwarf Mari-B�rbola and the male dwarf Nicolasico Pertusato; the latter, as Palomino points out, is placing his foot on the mastiff lying in front of the group to demonstrate the lethargic animal's good temper. Further back, almost swallowed up in the shadows, are a man described only as guardadamas - a guard or escort to the ladies - and the lady in waiting Do&#241;a Marcela de Ulloa.Vel�zquez is standing with brush and palette in front of a tall canvas; we can see only the back of it. There are some large pictures hanging on the back wall of the room. Two of them were painted by Vel�zquez's son-in-law, Mazo, from models by Rubens, and show scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses, one of them another version of the punishment of Arachne. The princess's parents, the king and queen, appear in a dark frame below these pictures, probably the glass of a mirror. To the right of the mirror, on a flight of steps leading up to a doorway and a brightly lit adjoining room, stands Jose Nieto, the queen's palace marshal.There are several basic questions that have been asked again and again about this picture. What is Vel�zquez painting on the front of the canvas that is hidden from us? Where did he stand in order to paint the scene and himself in it? What is the source of the image in the mirror - that is, just where in the room must the royal couple have been standing for their reflection to appear? And finally, is there any significance in the fact that the red cross of the Order of Santiago is prominently applied to the artist's clothing?It was long thought that Vel�zquez was creating a picture without any metaphysical or speculative reference, and was merely recording a fleeting moment in permanent form, as if in a snapshot. According to this theory the subject was no more than an ordinary scene of palace life.A different hypothesis is put forward by art historians, who believe that intellect and keen perspicacity, as well as the artist's eye and hand, were involved in the painting of Las Meninas. The largest number of interpretations have been put forward for the mirror on the back wall, sometimes also thought to be a painted canvas. Much learned industry has also been applied to the question of location: in which room in the palace is this scene taking place? Despite the riddles hidden in the painting of Las Meninas we must not overlook its artistic mastery, particularly as expressed in the figure of the Infanta Margarita surrounded by people of lesser birth. For it was on the princess that the dynastic hopes of the Spanish Habsburgs rested after the death of Prince Baltasar Carlos"

09781-bentivo.jpg	This signed work is one of most well-known of Lorenzo Costa's artistic production. In the portrait of Bentivoglio there is obviously a sound knowledge of Antonello  Messina's style, but what really dominates is the solidity and sculptural relief of the form, which Costa draws from Venetian painting. This is visible in the sturdy build of the whole figure, the imposing neck, and the well-placed head. Costa, who moved to Bologna from his native Ferrara in 1482, was one of the most interesting and modern exponents of Northern painting in this period

18242-0603grec.jpg	After a short period of study in Greece, El Greco, one of the most renowned figure in Spanish art, went to Venice in the middle of the sixteenth century, where he worked in Titian's workshop, and where he became familiar with the art of Paolo Veronese, Jacopo Bassano and Tintoretto, as well as works by representatives of the North Italian Mannerist school. Later, in Rome, he was strongly influenced by the work of Michelangelo. By the time he had settled in Toledo around 1576, his art was fully developed. Like most of the painters coming from Italy, he was anxious to enter the service of King Philip II, but the Greek painter's immediacy of passion, ecstatic style, disturbing colours and visionary conceptions did not please the king's academic Italian taste. He was, however, appreciated by the religious orders and the aristocratic patrons of Toledo.The penitent Magdalen must have been painted at the beginning of his years in Toledo because the strong influence of paintings on the same theme by Titian can be observed. The ideal of beauty is still Titian's half-figure pictures of women, but the inner tension of the whole composition and the relation between man and nature already indicate the beginning of Mannerism. The arrangement of the fingers of the right hand is a characteristic feature of El Greco's painting. It is assumed by some critics that the sitter of the painting was Jer�nima de las Cuevas, the mistress of the artist

10952-trompes.jpg	The Baptism of Christ forms the central section of a triptych commissioned by the treasurer of the city of Bruges, Jean Trompes. The wings show the donor's family and patron saints on the inside, and the Virgin and Child and the donor's first wife with St Elizabeth on the outside.Nowhere does the artist demonstrate more clearly both his talents and his limitations. The present scene contains virtually no action. The kneeling figures of John the Baptist and the angel dressed in a sumptuous cope reveal a mutual correspondence in their approximate symmetry and subtly differentiated positions. The panel's central axis is strongly emphasized by the figure of Christ, the dove of the Holy Ghost and the apparition of God the Father.In David's paintings the landscape forming the background to religious scenes takes on the motionless and precious look of something whose serenity opposes it to the tragedy of what is happening in the picture. One has only to look at the forest in the background of the Baptism of Christ, with its huge ivy-covered trunks, the strong rhythm of its escarpments and its foliage standing out against the blue of the distance. The still life of flowers in the foreground is characterized by a dazzling wealth of minute detail.This altarpiece was at one time considered one of the best works of Memling. The study of its wing panels was rightly recommended to landscape painters as the work of a marvellous painter of foliage

26692-lu02jac.jpg	"""Matthan begat Jacob. Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."" (Matthew 1:15-16)At the top of the entrance wall of the chapel, to the right of the viewer, next to the Eleazar-Matthan lunette, there is the one concluding the genealogical sequence of the ancestors of Christ in the Gospel of St Matthew.Sullen and perplexed, wrapped in a huge yellow ochre cloak and seemingly withdrawn, the old man - generally believed to be Jacob - dominates the family group on the left due to his expressive power and the quality of the colour. Similarly, on the right, the female figure, usually thought to be Mary, is more prominent than the other members of the Holy Family and the child holding a mirror. Behind Mary in the shadow, Joseph holds the Christ child, who stretches out an arm toward the round mirror held out at the height of his face by a naked female child, possibly an allegory of the Church.The compositional schemes of the two neighbouring lunettes correspond: in both there is a female figure in the foreground seen in full, or half, profile and facing the outer wall of the chapel, and a male figure, on the internal side, with his torso seen frontally."

15570-3annunci.jpg	At the height of the Presentation of the Virgin and the Marriage of Mary - above the corner of the chapel and connecting with the rear wall next to the Gothic window - there is the narrow fresco the Annunciation.Again Ghirlandaio has moved the scene of this biblical event to Tuscany and his own era. He was able to find the traditional Renaissance form of a painted window with a view of a landscape in many Florentine palaces. They can still be seen today in Florence, examples being the palaces of the Medici, Ruccelai and Strozzi families. The angel is derived from the Annunciation painted by the young Leonardo da Vinci between 1472 and 1475, now on view in the Galleria degli Uffizi.In contrast to Leonardo's horizontal format, in Ghirlandaio's fresco in the predetermined vertical format his Virgin may be depicted facing the observer in an equally frontal view, but she is standing upright. She is therefore reminiscent of the beautiful picture on the same theme by Lorenzo di Credi, an artist who was also taught by Verrocchio together with Leonardo and Ghirlandaio

31303-triumph.jpg	In Naples, a great part of the finest sculpture of the Quattrocento is Florentine export works by Donatello, Michelozzo, Antonio Rossellino and Benedetto da Maiano. The principal local sculptor is Francesco Laurana. His relief (shown on the picture) on the Triumphal Arch of Alfonso I, reveals him as charming, competent, and to a considerable extent heir to the tradition of Late Gothic realism.In 1453 a triumphal arch built as the entrance to the Castel Nuovo in Naples. This was intended to commemorate the temporary arch that had been erected in front of the cathedral when King Alfonso entered the city in triumph in 1443. Typifying Alfonso's dependence on Spanish staff, the Catalan master Pere Joan (active 1400-58) oversaw the project. Under his direction Pietro da Milano, a Lombard sculptor who had spent his early years working in Ragusa in Dalmatia, supervised the work of at least five master sculptors (including Francesco Laurana) and thirty-three assistants. Sculptural work was allocated to different workers, ensuring a speedy completion of the project.The attic story of this arch is decorated by a relief of The Triumphal Entry of Alfonso into Naples. In this relief, groups of figures, all carefully coordinated in size and scale, even though carved by different hands, enact an idealized and simplified version of Alfonso's triumphal entry into Naples a decade earlier. The sculptors evoke the character and decorum of early Roman imperial reliefs in the proud, calm bearing of nobles who process behind Alfonso, enthroned and elevated on a canopied processional cart, and in the more active figures of the musicians and horsemen who lead the way

35015-pieta.jpg	It is already clear in this, his first definitely dated work, that Girolamo Romanino, like Lotto and Savoldo, was reluctant to enter fully into the tradition of Venetian figurative art. The panel was painted for the Chapel of the Holy Passion in the old church of San Lorenzo in Brescia and in it we can see Romanino's predilection for Titian's sonorously rich colour transposed onto a plane of popular narrative strengthened by a romantic, imaginative pathos. Against the background of a landscape which itself seems constricted in its atmosphere of profound anguish, the figures of the foreground seem to float to the surface in sharply cadenced groupings painted in timbres of a blazing quality. The influence of Lombard style which can be noted in the roundish faces painted after the fashion of Bramante, are accompanied by the influence of Northern European painting which can be seen in the view of the town glimpsed through the steamy, stormy atmosphere, in the objective quality of the portrait of the man, in the expressionistic deformation of the little human figures moving around the crosses at Golgotha.In this earliest attributable work by Romanino, the characteristic quality of the artist's style is already evident: an expressionistic realism which seems to offer an extremely personalized reflection of the political, social and religious crises that shook the Western world in the first half of the sixteenth century

12322-8windsor.jpg	The painting is a portable triptych of a type that was fairly widely produced in Italy during the early fourteenth century, essentially for private worship. For the purposes of travel the wings would have closed inwards covering the centre panels and lying flush with the raised spandrel above the inner moulding. The backs of the wings were most probably painted with imitation marble or porphyry, perhaps with decorative motifs, as opposed to narrative scenes. The creation of a work of art of this kind was due to a combination of craftsmanship and painterly skills. Some of the finest surviving examples are Florentine or Sienese in origin. The triptych in the Royal Collection is comparable with examples in the National Gallery in London, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Pinacoteca in Siena, and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all of which, according to varying degrees of attribution, are associated with Duccio or his workshop.The exact attribution of the present triptych is unsettled owing to the multiplicity of hands at work not only in Duccio's workshop as a whole, but even on the surface of individual paintings. The centre panel in particular is of a quality worthy of Duccio himself. The same might almost be said of the lower scenes in each of the wings, certainly in their design even if the actual execution reveals evidence of assistants (for example, the gold decoration on the cloth of honour behind Christ and the Virgin Enthroned, lower right). The inconsistencies apparent in the architecture of Annunciation (top left) or the design of the two thrones are not unknown in Duccio's own work, as revealed in the Maest&#224; of 1308-11 (Siena, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo) with which this triptych is comparable in date or possibly slightly earlier.The iconography of the panels is also significant. Paradoxically, the inner religious consistency is derived from the unusual combination of scenes, especially the pairing of enthroned figures in the lower sections of the wings. The enthronement of the Virgin twice (lower left and lower right), for instance, suggests a temporal sequence before and after Christ's death as represented in the centre. The Annunciation (top left) is comparable with the relevant scene (now in the National Gallery, London) from the Maest&#224;, whereas both Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata (top right) and Christ and the Virgin Enthroned (lower right) recall frescoes in the Upper Church of St Francis, Assisi (the former in the nave from the Life of Saint Francis and the latter, earlier in date and by Cimabue, in the transept). These connotations and the treatment of the crucifixion in a devotional, as opposed to a narrative sense, imply a Franciscan origin for this triptych. The quantity of blood depicted in the central scene (some of it removed in an earlier restoration) is an unusual feature in a work on this scale.Probably before it became part of the Royal Collection the triptych had been dismantled and put in a heavy gothic frame, which was removed when it was cleaned in 1930. After this the triptych was displayed in a shadow box with a simpler frame. This, too, was considered to be inappropriate and the present reconstruction of the triptych was devised in 1988, although further thought has since been given to the angle at which the two wings should be positioned in order to make proper visual sense of the architecture.

23175-13monaco.jpg	This panel formed part of a predella, which included a Visitation (Courtauld Galleries, London), a Nativity (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), an Adoration of the Magi (Courtauld Galleries, London), and a Flight into Egypt (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg).The oblong frame, with a semicircle on every corner and angular projections between them, divides the picture into three parts and Lorenzo Monaco made good use of the possibilities offered by the unusual shape of the frame. He placed the Virgin and her Child-isolated from the other figures-into the central, widest part. The Virgin is riding the ass side-saddle, as though she were sitting on a throne, and she is turned towards us. To indicate the direction of her course, her body is a little bent backwards. The oblique line of her body suggests a straight line between the upper point of the frame and the bottom inward angle on the right, and this diagonal axis is further stressed by the ass's foreleg, stepping forwards, which, continuing the same line, eventually ends in the semicircle. A similar connection between the composition and the frame can be observed in the hindmost leg of the ass and the bottom left semicircle. The oblique line of the leg is a reflected image of the axis which was mentioned previously. The horizontal line of the animal's body links the figures of the Virgin and Joseph, and, at the same time, it separates the Holy Family from the women accompanying them. The palm branches in the hands of the woman in a green cloak, and the drapery falling downwards from her arm, practically creates a line between the top and the bottom angular indentations of the frame. (According to some apocryphal gospels the fleeing Holy Family was nourished by the fruits of a palm-tree bending towards them.) The background, too, separates the left-hand side of the picture from the rest: the escorts proceed among bare, grey rocks, while the Holy Family move through woods: the foliage magically illuminates the semi-darkness.Whilst the two female figures are moving forwards, Joseph, at the head of the small group, has stopped and looks back. By this the painting representing progress in one direction becomes enclosed and symmetrical. This geometrically constructed composition with its strict rhythm by Lorenzo Monaco shows, as do all his works, that even while pursuing the best trecento traditions of Florentine art, an artist could adjust himself to the International Gothic style. Counterparts of the two women, with the long, even and soft folds of their draperies, or of the Virgin's graceful, aristocratic figure, could be found anywhere in the art of the period. On the other hand, the vigorous and definite personality of Joseph can be imagined only in Florentine art, which had old, democratic traditions. In vain would we try to find this image in the representations of Joseph as the humble old man in Northern art

15209-david.jpg	Orazio Gentileschi's brooding image of David contemplating the head of Goliath reflects a new type of meditative image introduced at the beginning of the seventeenth century by Caravaggio. Traditionally David was shown either as an uncompromised biblical hero slaying Goliath or as a triumphant youth displaying the giant's decapitated head. In Caravaggio's David with the Head of Goliath (Galleria Borghese, Rome), which was likely to have been sent from Naples around 1609 as a gift for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the adolescent hero gazes tenderly at his victim's head, creating a strong, almost erotic, bond. Orazio's David does not interact with Goliath's head, rather he stands beside it lost in a moment of deep introspection, evoking a pensive atmosphere similar to the mood generated in Caravaggio's St John the Baptist. Like the St John, David's body is pushed towards the picture plane and set off against a background of dense, dark foliage. This verdant background is strikingly different from the one in Orazio's small copper version (Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Berlin), in which David is framed by a rocky cliff. The difference has led some critics to suggest that Agostino Tassi was responsible for the landscape in the Spada picture, but there is no conclusive proof to substantiate this.Unlike the Berlin copper, where David is seen full-length, in the Spada version his body is cropped just below the knee and Goliath's head is turned upwards towards the viewer. It has been suggested that the Spada canvas was cut down at the bottom. However, technical evidence shows that instead it was extended on all four sides. Thus the picture would have focused more directly on the contemplative and melancholic David and the head of Goliath would have appeared to rest on the edge of the frame. A copy of the Berlin composition (Quadreria Arcivescovile, Milan) was paired with a version of Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith Beheading Holofernes , but there is no evidence to indicate that two pictures of such contrasting moods were originally conceived as pendants.

17983-07scene.jpg	"The Preaching to the Birds and Blessing Montefalco took place in Umbria. The precise topographical description of the places is noticeable. In the middle distance a view of the Umbrian town of Bevagna can be seen, near to which the preaching to the birds is supposed to have taken place. The mighty Monte Subasio, with a little church half way up, and a view of the town of Assisi, form the background. In the background on the left, at the foot of the table mountain, lies Assisi with the fortress and magnificent monastery church of San Francesco that was not built until after St Francis' death. The topography of the cities is also in accordance with reality: Assisi lies to the north west of Montefalco.The preaching Francis is pointing upwards to indicate that he is speaking about God. The 13 different kinds of birds, including a hoopoe, a swan, a thrush, a magpie, a pheasant and a dove, underline by their exceptional, unnatural gathering the godliness of the conversation.Almost in the centre of the picture, the saint and his companion appear simultaneously a second time. The two scenes are compositionally separated by the two figures which are seen standing in profile. Not until they reach the background do the two landscapes meet. Various chronological levels become evident in the conscious division of the pictorial space. On the wall the city coat of arms of Montefalco appears.Before St Francis, four men are reverently kneeling. The one in the front is wearing a Franciscan habit and a cap bearing the inscription M. MARCUS. He is holding a bishop's miter in his hands. This might be the ""Master Marcus"" who towards the end of the 14th century was the bishop of Sarsina and later of Marsico Nuovo. Fra Jacopo, who commissioned the work, is the second kneeling Franciscan. The other people are presumably members of the Calvi family, which in the 15th century acted on several occasions as donors for the church of San Francesco in Montefalco.The inscription beneath the picture describes what is taking place: QUANDO B. F. PR(A)EDICAVIT AUIBUS APUD MEUANEUM DEMU(M) BENEDIXIT MO(N)TEM FALONE(M) ET P(O)PULU(M) - ""How St. Francis preached to the birds and then blessed Montefalco and the population."

The scene depicts a nurse who is evidently preparing a meal for an invalid. While the delicacy of the treatment is typical of eighteenth century, the choice of a genre subject shows the influence of seventeenth century Dutch domestic scenes, which Chardin studied in his youth.At the Salon of 1747 it was exhibited together with a companion piece.

31065-2august2.jpg	In 1454 Piero agreed to paint a polyptych for the Augustinians of Borgo San Sepolcro; the painting was to be finished within eight years and was intended for their monastery. As usual, the work was not completed until much later. The polyptych later dismembered and the panels were scattered. It was only in the twentieth century that scholars succeeded in reconstructing this work. Among the parts of the polyptych that have unfortunately not survived there is also the central panel which represented the Virgin Enthroned.St Michael was one of the four side panels depicting four saints (St Augustine and St Michael at the left side and St John the Evangelist and St Nicholas of Tolentino at the right).Archangel Michael is portrayed as an ancient warrior, his athletic limbs made more elegant by his precious armour, by the graceful tunic and by his beautiful boots decorated by with tiny pearls. There is nothing violent nor dramatic in the killing of the dragon, who is shown as a snake, its decapitated body lying on the ground

41375-06madonn.jpg	This panel, originally attributed to Simone Martini, was discovered in Naples in 1904. As early as 1906 this attribution was already contested and the painting was reassigned to a variety of different painters in the circle of Martini; among them Naddo Ceccarelli, Lippo Memmi, and Donato Martini. At the same time, a number of art historians supported the attribution of the work to Simone Martini.More recently, scholars have agreed in assigning it to a close collaborator of Martini, an anonymous master who takes his eponym from this painting , which was formerly kept in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome (The Master of Palazzo Venezia). This panel was once the central element of a polyptych, to which a St Peter and Mary Magdalene at the National Gallery in London are also considered to have belonged. The reconstruction of the career and artistic personality of this painter has shed light on the artist's exquisite transposition of Simone Martini's formal vocabulary. The dating of the piece has been assigned to some time after the anonymous master's 1333 Annunciation (Uffizi Gallery, Florence), perhaps when Simone had already left for Avignon

08992-07italia.jpg	The painting is signed and dated: Claude in. f.  Romae 1642. The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 64).A shepherd-couple are placed in the foreground of this southern landscape. The woman is seated on a rock and is listening to the shepherd playing the shawm. To the right of the picture is a tent supported by a tree, and on the left a stone bridge leads to a ruined Roman temple. In the background the open sea is half-obscured by the mist of a warm summer's day.The painter, whose real name was Claude Gell�e, was a native of Lorraine. When he first arrived in Rome, he worked as a pastrycook, then as assistant to the landscape painter Agostino Tassi, whom he helped with decorative work. Not much is known about his early career. It was only in his thirties that he began to acquire stature and reputation as an artist in his own right. The German painter-biographer Joachim von Sandrart, reporting on his visit to Rome (1629-35), writes that Claude was determined 'to become familiar with nature in all its forms, and would spend whole days and late into the night in the fields, so that he learned how to convey most naturally the flush of day, the rising and setting of the sun . . .'.Characteristic features of Claude's art are the subtle moods of the landscape and the variation in the seascape with the changing seasons. People are unimportant in his pictures; the painter regarded them only as a means of lending animation to his landscapes and as a rule he did not even paint them himself. In the 1630s he started a book which he gradually filled with pen-and-ink drawings of almost 200 of his own pictures; although it does not comprise his entire oeuvre, it is nevertheless a unique documentary record of his artistic creations. The book is preserved today in the British Museum under the title Liber Veritatis; in it the Berlin landscape features on p. 64, and according to a note written on the verso, the work was commissioned by a patron in Paris.This picture is recorded as having been in English private ownership in the early eighteenth century: until 1722 it was in the possession of the Duke of Portland, who sold it to the Earl of Scarbrough. About 1818 it passed into the possession of Count Pourtal�s and from him, in 1865, into the collection of the Marquis de la Ganay, from whom Bode bought it in 1881 for the Berlin Gallery

09602-day.jpg	The painting was probably cut down slightly on the sides and top, painted originally for a local church at the same time that he was working on the frescoes in the Cathedral. It can be considered as the companion of the Nativity (The Night) in Dresden.Considered his masterpiece among the altarpieces, the composition is built up as a remote variation of the pyramidal arrangements favoured by Leonardo, broken by the dominating verticality of St Jerome on the left. The sacra conversazione is transformed into an informal and incidental narrative that takes place in a landscape. A makeshift red canopy has been constructed in the foreground, where his figures are massed on a compact, constricted plane. Their poses are particularly hard to reconstruct because they are either figures covered by draperies that effectively hide their structure, or are in intricate unnatural positions. As Correggio grew older, he began to take liberties with the conventions regarding the proportion of figures. Saint Jerome on the left, accompanied by his identifying lion, occupies almost the entire height of the painting, assuming a dominant role even in relation to the Madonna and Child. His thick, muscular right leg is strikingly long in comparison to his upper body and rather smallish head.The pictorial effects derive from a masterly application of the oil paint, confident and elegant colour, and idealized, refined faces

26005-02last4.jpg	The closed altarpiece shows the donor and his wife kneeling in prayer, each before a niche containing respectively a statue of the Virgin and Child and St Michael battling with demons. Their escutcheons are mounted on the polygonal base of the niches. These were identified as belonging to the Florentines Angelo di Jacopo Tani (1415-1492) and Caterina di Francesco Tanagli (1446-1492). Tani was an agent of the Medici bank in Bruges in 1450, before becoming its manager in 1455. He was ousted by Tommaso Portinari in 1465. Tani married in Florence in 1466, and his wife bore a daughter (one of several) on 8 June 1471. He drew up his will on 12 December 1467, the same month as he was sent back north to save the London branch from bankruptcy. The holy figures represented here evidently relate first and foremost to the devotion of the donors. The coats-of-arms were originally reversed - in other words, the man's arms appeared in the woman's panel, and vice versa.Before departing for London in December 1467, Tani founded a chapel dedicated to St Michael at his employer's church in Fiesole and drew up his will. He probably also made funeral arrangements in the customary manner. He will then have required an altarpiece, which he ordered from Memling some time after the end of 1467 during his stay in the north. The painting was, therefore, largely executed during his stay in London between 1467 and 1469, from where he could monitor its progress. The iconography of the altarpiece is clarified by its destination. St Michael has been selected here first and foremost as the saint to whom the chapel was dedicated, and only in the second place as Tani's patron. This also explains the absence of the woman's patron. Taken together, the grisailles depict the victory of St Michael over Satan, who was threatening the Virgin and Christ Child

10756-apocalyp.jpg	After attending the drawing school of the Royal Dublin Society and spending a brief period in London, Danby settled around 1813 for two decades in Bristol, in whose environs he painted the small, exquisite landscapes on which his fame today largely rests. Forced to leave England in 1829 due to financial problems and a marital scandal, Danby established himself in Paris and Geneva, where he remained until 1840. His oils, ink drawings, and watercolours, focussing on lyrically romantic landscapes, represents one of the most significant contributions made by any artist to nineteenth-century British landscape painting. He also concerned himself with religious themes, treated in a visionary manner.The present painting is presumably one of four depicting scenes from the Apocalypse. In a Romantic nocturnal landscape evoking the infinity of the cosmos appears a vision of the giant angel described in Chapter 10 of the Apocalypse, descending in a cloud from heaven with a rainbow over his head and legs like columns of fire. The natural scene in which the visionary apparition is set evinces a coloration and sophisticated painterly handling that explain Danby's rank as one of the finest British landscapists of the nineteenth century

31000-ecstasy.jpg	This is among Piazzetta's finest paintings and is also a masterpiece of eighteenth-century sacred art. The altarpiece (which was originally in the church of S. Maria d'Aracoeli in Vicenza) is composed along three parallel diagonals that cut across the composition from left to right. The most important section is in the centre where Piazzetta contrasts the luminous and robust figure of the wonderful angel with the lifeless, dark, and heavy figure of the fainting saint. The descriptive detail (such as the scruffy wooden structure or the figure of Brother Leo with his back to us) accentuate the feeling of isolation and intense mysticism.

The loaded brushstrokes and the swirling, undulating forms are typical of the artist's late work.Living in the asylum in Saint-R�my, van Gogh repeatedly turned his attention to the no-man's-land between the wide world out there and his own confined world. When he looked across the low wall that enclosed the asylum, he found a whole world of subjects awaiting him. There was a range of hills, the Alpilles, with countless olive trees at their feet and an occasional solitary cypress crowning them to counteract the gentle ups and downs of the hills with a bold vertical.The immense cypresses in this painting are seen so close that the top of one is cropped by the upper edge of the picture.

14397-st_bruno.jpg	St Bruno was canonised in 1623, and so appeared frequently at that time in paintings from throughout southern Europe.Le Puy is the capital of the Haute Loire, part of a large upland area, the Massif central, in the southern central region of France. The large number of Romanesque churches in and around the town bear testimony to the fact that it flourished in the Middle ages. It was never an area noted for painting activity, and the return of Guy Fran�ois from Rome to his native region was therefore to be of great significance in local terms, much more so than similar events in other centres where there was more than one painter active. Guy Fran�ois was to work in isolation for more than thirty years, gradually diluting his art as memories of what he had learned in Rome faded. The pictures that he painted in France nearly all remain in and around Le Puy.It is only in recent years that the Italian period of Guy Fran�ois has been reconstructed and his Italian pictures disentangled from the work of Carlo Saraceni. Saraceni, a difficult artist to define, was essentially eclectic, with an unusual skill in brushwork almost akin to that of a northerner. He assimilated many influences, ranging from Caravaggio to the German ERlsheimer.The picture by Fran�ois that most shows the influence of Saraceni is the Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth, now in the Mus�e de l'Ain at Bourg-en-Bresse. Like much of Fran�ois's work, it was intended as a large altarpiece. His altarpieces that survived in the Le Puy area, in the churches for which they were painted, are often surrounded by a provincial version of a sculptured and stuccoed framework in the Italian Baroque style. Although commonplace in Italy, such pictures in situ are rare in France; most seventeenth century altarpieces by the major painters are now in museums. The Holy Family altarpiece has the simplified forms sometimes found in works by Saraceni and also the strong lighting suitable for a prominent position in a church, where the picture would normally be seen from a distance.The strength of some of Guy Fran�ois' compositions has led some authorities to suggest that he was influenced by Nicolas Tournier, but the most likely explanations for their superficial similarity are that both artists brought back from Italy similar Caravaggesque influences, and that both of them were forced to rely on what they had experienced and learned without renewed contact with their sources. Both painter had a predilection for monumental scale, although Fran�ois never achieved Tournier's dramatic intensity. Instead he provided, in an area isolated from all artistic contact, a whole group of soundly painted and striking altarpieces

22761-ecstasy.jpg	In his second Epistle to the Corinthians, St Paul describes the revelations that were made to him. Liss portrays one of the apostle's visions, `how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter'. Above the seated apostle, who is surrounded by books, an angel draws aside a curtain; terrified, Paul shrinks back from the expanse of heaven revealed to him. Angels playing musical instruments gambol in the clouds, and in the distance the Trinity appears. The colours range from the deep violet of Paul's cloak through the green of the curtain to the most delicate yellow, blue and pink of the clouds. This painting with its extraordinary wealth of brilliant colour is one of the artist's finest works and seems to anticipate the Venetian painting of the eighteenth century.With the exception of Adam Elsheimer, Johann Liss was the most outstanding German painter of the seventeenth century. He was born in Schleswig-Holstein c. 1597, spent several years studying in the Netherlands, where he came into contact with the Haarlem painters, principally Goltzius and Buytewech, and with the Flemish followers of Caravaggio in Antwerp (Janssens, Jordaens). Liss then made his way to Italy via Paris. To begin with, he worked in Rome, where he was a member of the Netherlandish artists' colony, and exactly when he settled in Venice is not known. Until his early death, supposedly a victim of the plague which broke out in 1629, he continued to work in Venice and it was in these last years that he produced his best-known works, among them The Ecstasy of St Paul. Together with Domenico Feti, Liss played an important part in reviving the use of rich colours, a Venetian tradition which had ended with Tintoretto.In the seventeenth century this painting was in the famous collection of the Amsterdam merchant Gerrit Reynst (died 1658), which consisted mainly of works by Venetian masters and included a companion-piece, The Vision of St Peter, which was subsequently lost. Both pictures were engraved by Jeremias Falck and attributed to Johann Liss, but it seems certain that the St Peter picture was not the work of Liss but of Domenico Feti, who was a close friend of the German painter. It may be that after Feti's death (1623), his patron decided to commission Johann Liss to paint the companion-picture to the St Peter. The Ecstasy of St Paul came up for sale in Amsterdam in 1722 with the Van de Amory Collection and found its way through a Florentine art-dealer into the Berlin collection of A. von Frey, from which it passed in 1919 to the Picture Gallery

24032-0sposi1.jpg	The space of the room with a square plan (8,1 x 8,1 m) is essentially a cube, and in it Mantegna has created a monumental architectural reality by means of ribs on the ceiling connecting with pilasters on the walls, which are in turn supported by a marble socle. In the centre of the ceiling is the much-admired oculus, opening onto a painted sky. The interplay of levels of reality elaborates ideas already set forth in his art. Only the corbels are actually stone, the highly worked ribs, the garlands that encircle the eight busts of emperors supported by putti, and the ensembles in decorative lozenges are painted to simulate marble so convincingly that even the modern viewer is sometimes fooled. In the triangular spaces at the edges of the ceiling are twelve mythological scenes of Orpheus, Orion, and Hercules with backgrounds of simulated mosaics, a device that Raphael was to use in the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura. Only two of the walls have figurative narrations: the north wall with a scene that is usually called the Court and the west wall, divided into three scenes, Servants with Horse and Dogs, the Inscription with Putti, and the Meeting. The remaining two walls are painted with imitation leather draperies that encroach upon the other sides as well to create the fiction that there were curtains before all four walls and on two sides they had been opened up to reveal the events depicted.The central subject of the frescoes is Ludovico III Gonzaga, his wife, his children, and his court. A closed letter held by Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga in the Meeting seems to be the same one, now opened, that Ludovico, seated majestically, holds in the Court, and must be considered important for understanding the paintings. The style of the frescoes is similar to Mantegna's previous works. The compositions are dominated by the narrative elements, with the figures set frieze-like, close to the picture plane within a narrow spatial shelf in front of a landscape or architectural setting

23142-3pomegra.jpg	The Madonna and Christ Child appear in a window, and the child is standing on the balustrade below it. She is holding a pomegranate that has been cut open out to him, and the boy has taken some of it, for he is showing Mary red pearls of fruit that he is holding in his clumsy child's hand. Mary appears melancholy, as if she knows about the future Passion of her son, symbolized by the pomegranate.This is one of the first Florentine panel paintings known today to have been produced with a paint medium containing oil for colour pigments. This technique first appeared in northern painting in the first half of the 15th century and rapidly spread there. Italian developed the technique later. The panel is very small by Italian standards, yet not at all an unusual format in Flemish painting. The Christ Child as well, with his fat, tummy overlong torso and skinny little arms, refutes the widespread generally more rounded Florentine type of depiction.This Madonna is modeled after one by Leonardo; in fact, the painting was formerly thought to be an early work by Leonardo

There is real poetry in its vigour, and a delight in the wildness of nature, in towering trees and rich foliage, which makes one regret that this aspect of his art is so rare. Combined with his still-lifes and with the fascinating trompe l'oeil decorations of his own house, it helps to explain contemporary appreciation of him as a 'universal' painter

15203-cecilia.jpg	The painting depicts the appearance of an angel to Valerianus and Cecilia, a young couple who had been converted to Christianity. Cecilia had taken a vow of chastity and had persuaded her husband to do likewise. Valerianus had suspected her of secretly being in love with his f riend Tiburtius but the angelic apparition allays his doubts while also heralding their approaching martyrdom.The composition - showing the three sumptuously dressed saints as they express with dignity their astonishment over the apparition of the angel - incorporates the main elements of Gentileschi's art. It represents a high point of his maturity, ranking with the Madonna of the Rosei family and the Annunciation in Turin. The disciplined, orderly construction has a Neoclassical stamp that derives from the artist's Tuscan background. The handling of the light shows the fundamental influence of Caravaggio, while the refinement of the surfaces in the gleaming satin and damask draperies and the soft warmth of the velvets are inspired by Bronzino.Typical of Gentileschi are the arrested gestures standing out against the opaque shadow of the austere interior; the figure of Tibertius, silhouetted against the light as he cautiously peers at the angel; the system of curves formed by the wings, the body and the long palm branch of the angel in flight; and the outstretched arms of St. Cecilia and St. Valerianus. The structural elements of the composition are striking: the link between Tibertius' hand and the angel's foot; the alignment of the palm branch and the organ pipes, and the wreath of flowers, St. Cecilia's hand and St. Valerianus' knee; and the parallels formed by the figures of St. Valerianus and St. Cecilia, the organ pipes and the door frame, the keyboard and the dais. Every element is brought into complex play in this highly articulated composition, from the tips of the wings and the palm branch to the edge of the red mantle, St. Valerianus' foot and the velvet cushion.

14989-2ponta04.jpg	This work was probably produced at the beginning of 1894, when Gauguin painted another snowscape, Paris in the Snow (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Van Gogh). During his two years in Paris he painted far fewer works than before - large amounts of his time were taken up with organizing his show at Durand-Ruel's and on a number of literary projects. Consequently, what little he did paint was not new in either subject or treatment. This landscape is remarkably similar to those that he had produced during his Impressionist period - the small brush-strokes are quite different from the broad sweeps of colour that characterized his Tahitian works

11595-salome.jpg	Dolci was a painter of intense religiosity. His work was much sought after internationally during his own lifetime and his reputation reached its apogee during the eighteenth century, particularly in England. The meticulous finish, careful elaboration of detail and concentration of expression, especially in those compositions with single figures, are the hallmarks of a style that proved to be influential even in the late eighteenth century in the work, for example, of Jean-Baptiste Greuze.The biblical source for the painting is Matthew 14:6-11 or Mark 6:21-8, where the daughter of Herodias danced for her stepfather, Herod, on his birthday. As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.Dolci painted several versions of Salome. According to Baldinucci, the original version was painted, probably during the 1660s, for the Marchese Rinuccini in Florence and it proved to be the artists most popular work, known through two other variants of good quality (Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen and Glasgow, City Museum and Art Gallery), which in turn spawned numerous copies. Of the three versions recorded by Baldinucci, the present painting is the second, which was acquired by Sir John Finch (1626&#151;82) who gave it to Charles II. Finch was the English Resident at the court of the Grand Duke Ferdinand II in Florence from 1665 to 1670.You can view other depictions of Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.

03041-07lamen.jpg	Kneeling beneath the crosses of Calvary, the Virgin mourns her Son whose body lies before her. John supports the dead Christ's head, while Mary Magdalene, her long hair flowing, lifts one of His hands to her cheek. Behind John stands Joseph of Arimathaea with an anointing-vessel, and behind the Virgin rises the upright of the bare cross, stained with the blood of the crucified Saviour; on the tree next to it can be seen the bound foot of one of the thieves. Beyond is a rocky landscape with a castle on the edge of a lake.Apart from the Berlin panel, the theme of the Lamentation occurs in only one other painting by Baldung. The picture in the Landesmuseum at Innsbruck, which bears the date 1513 and is clearly an earlier work, is much more constricted, more angular and restless in its composition. In the Berlin painting the dramatic outburst of grief on the part of John and Mary Magdalene has given way to silent resignation. This simplification of the forms and softening of the outline is also apparent in two drawings on the same theme, a sketch in Basel for the Innsbruck painting, which bears the date 1513, and a drawing in a private collection, which is dated 1515. By studying as well two woodcuts on the same subject, the consistent development of Baldung's style from early apprenticeship to the full maturity of the Berlin Lamentation shows up in a telling manner.The artist, whose family came from Swabia, was born at Weyersheim near Strasbourg. At the age of 18 he began his apprenticeship in D�rer's workshop in Nuremberg. It may have been the patricians of the imperial city who later obtained for him the commission for two altarpieces which he completed around 1507 for Halle Cathedral. One, representing the Adoration of the Magi, eventually found its way to the Berlin Gallery. While in Strasbourg, of which town he had become a burgher in 1509, he received the important commission for the high altar in Freiburg Cathedral, whereupon he moved to Freiburg and spent several years there, roughly between 1512 and 1517. It was only towards the end of the second decade, when he had completed this major work, that Baldung seems to have painted the Lamentation, in which one can detect traces of the imposing Freiburg style, a distinct departure from the late-Gothic resonances of the Innsbruck panel.Hardly anything is known about the origins of this picture. At one time it belonged to a private collector in southern France. Wilhelm Bode bought it and presented it to the Berlin Gallery in 1907

31314-altar_1.jpg	This panel belonged to an altarpiece, now dismembered. According to the reconstruction accepted by many scholars, the altarpiece consisted of a Virgin and Child in the centre (Brooklyn Museum, New York), St Augustin (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg) at the left, and probably St Nicholas (lost) at the right. The three predella panels are the Departure of St Augustin (Staatliche Museen, Berlin), the Entry of Christ to Jerusalem (Pinacoteca Stuard, Parma), and the Birth of St Nicholas (Kunstmuseum, Basel)

26700-lu04azo.jpg	"""Eliakim begat Azor. Azor begat Zadok. Zadok begat Achim."" (Matthew 1:13-14)This is the first lunette on the north wall.The absence of information regarding the figures represented has thwarted any attempt to identify them. On the left a seated woman is shown indicating something outside the lunette to a boy (or a girl) who seems to be engrossed in writing or drawing and turns somewhat hesitantly. The woman's pose, with its great naturalness and self-possession, is a variation on the twisted head, shoulders, and legs of the other figures.On the other side of the lunette, seen sideways on, but with his head turned toward the viewer, sits a solitary mature man, his face furrowed by deep lines. Tightly wrapped in his yellow ochre mantle, from which only his head and an arm emerge, he appears to be prey to distressing thoughts. The body, modelled concisely with great plastic power by the interplay of light and shade, and the pattern of the folds of the mantle, stands out clearly against the background.The number of figures present in this lunette is half that of the first lunettes painted by Michelangelo. This sense of isolation intensifies the expressive power of the figure of the pensive man, which some interpreted as being an imaginary self-portrait of the artist"

In 1856 he traveled for the first time to Italy, where he intended to make the acquaintance of his Italian relatives. This journey, which was followed by another in 1858 and several more in 1859, was Degas's real education. In Italy, Degas preferred the Quattrocento painters and the exponents of Florentine Mannerism.The people Degas depicted in that time were almost all members of his family, especially his sisters and brothers, and himself.

09741-grif_02.jpg	The reconstruction of the polyptych, dismembered in the 18th century, is not unambiguous. It seems certain that the central panel was the painting of St Vincent Ferrer while on his sides were St Peter and St John the Baptist. Paintings of St Lucy and St John the Baptist were probably located on the upper part of the sides while a Crucifixion tondo was in the upper central position.

11285-307delac.jpg	The capture of Algiers in 1830 had given France the Sultan of Morocco as a neighbour. Louis Philippe's government decided to send him an ambassador extraordinary, the Comte de Mornay; the latter wished to take an official artist with him and chose Eugene Delacroix. The mission left Toulon on 11 January 1832, landed at Tangiers on the 25 January, travelled through a part of Morocco, and returned via Oran and Algiers.During his visit to this country, Delacroix witnessed spectacles belonging to a noble and primitive way of life which provided material for his art until he died; but he had not been allowed to enter the jealously guarded harems of the Moslems. It was the chief harbour engineer at Algiers who persuaded one of the port officials, a former reis or owner of privateers, to allow Delacroix into his own harem.In these few hours Delacroix did several watercolour sketches, some of which are in the Louvre. Using them as a basis, he painted a large picture on his return, and exhibited it in the 1834 salon. He wanted to show the dark tones of flesh and the subdued colours in the warm half-light of the harem.In 1849 he painted another smaller version of the same subject, now in the Mus�e de Montpellier. Here the colours are softer and the atmosphere more intimate; it has a note of nostalgia absent from the 1834 Salon picture, which is still full of his first impressions, and which already foreshadows Renoir. The latter artist was well aware of this relationship; in 1872 he painted a large picture inspired by Delacroix's canvas and called Les Parisiennes habill�es en Alg�riennes (Tokyo Museum). He had already done an Odalisque and exhibited it in the 1870 Salon. (Chester Dale Collection, New York.)

07580-49franci.jpg	The founder of the Franciscan Order was the first person to experience the miracle of stigmatization of his own body. In other words, he was marked out by Christ's wounds. Here he is reduced to the ideal state of penance in the wilderness - a state equally valid for saints and pious people. Caravaggio shows no sign of reinterpreting the story unconventionally. His rather traditional approach may derive from the fact that the composition is probably a commission from the papal family. They owned the township known as Carpineto, from where an almost identical second version, stored at present in the Palazzo Venezia, Rome, originated. Stylistically, the painting is very closely related to the Brera Supper in Emmaus, which was probably painted in Latium.

35911-barberin.jpg	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the hall in the apartment of Anna Colonna in the north wing of the Palazzo Barberini. It represents the Triumph of Divina Sapientia.The Palazzo Barberini, residence of the papal family Barberini, set a new standard for Roman palace architecture and its painted decoration. Planning for the expansion of the sixteenth-century structure was first undertaken by Carlo Maderno, then transferred after his death to Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who here distinguished himself as an architect for the first time.The first commission for the painted decor was given to Andrea Sacchi who in 1629-30 painted the ceiling of the largest room in the wing occupied by Anna Colonna, Taddeo Barberini's wife. Sacchi painted here the fresco identified as Triumph of Divina Sapientia (divine wisdom). Sirens in the room corners hold up small sun disks that extend up into the fresco. They anticipate the theme of the ceiling, in which the sun plays a central role.The design of the ceiling omits architectural elements completely. Viewers find themselves confronted with a startling heavenly vision including, among other things, realistically depicted astronomical bodies - Earth and the sun hand directly above them. The personification of Divine Wisdom is seated on the Solomonic lion throne, crowned by two Barberini bees, before a huge radiating solar disk in yellow-gold. Imaginative cloud formations fill the greater part of the picture surface, creating a perspective pull that graphically suggests the vast distance between the smaller Earth at the bottom edge of the picture and the gigantic sun.It is obvious that Sacchi's ceiling presents a commentary on the then current issue of Galileo Galilei's heliocentric worldview

42967-01view.jpg	In 1577 a serious fire in the Palazzo Ducale destroyed the Sala del Maggior Consiglio, originally the meeting place for the Venetian legislature.

44047-2abegg.jpg	The Abegg Triptych was painted for an Italian gentleman, an unidentified member of the Villa family from Chieri in Piedmont, who were active in banking in the Netherlands. Their coat of arms appears in the glazed window in the left wing. The picture is generally regarded as a late work by one of Rogier's successors, perhaps not painted until the 1460s, though some of the figures of the Crucifixion were copied as early as 1447 by the Hamburg painter Hans Bornemann, who died in 1475. The costume of the donor and the findings from dendrochronological investigation allow us to date the picture to the middle of the 1440s. Compared to figures in works by Rogier's own hand the figures here, particularly in the Crucifixion, seem excessively emotional; instead of radiating dignified grief they are uttering loud cries of lamentation.Once again, the design of the triptych must have been by an assistant in Rogier's workshop. The figure of the red-robed St. John to the left of the Cross shows how he reworked the master's figural types to suit his own ideas. The model is St John in Rogier's Deposition (Prado, Madrid), and it is followed faithfully in such details as the right foot. The folds of the robe, however, are more strongly modeled.The cloak in particular, very dynamically draped and with a large fold flung backward over the shoulder, gives the figure a sense of agitation that is in tune with the character of this painting as a whole, but not with its model. Similarly, Mary Magdalene's cloak slipping down from her hips picks up a motif from the Deposition, but combines it with an extrovert gesture foreign to that picture, with the saint suddenly flinging up her arms.The series of the three panels follows a chronological sequence: the sculptural Annunciation group in the donor's loggia refers to Christ's becoming man; in the central panel Christ has just died, and the sun and moon turn dark as His companions break into loud lamentations; on the right Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, and a servant are approaching with a ladder to take the dead body down from the Cross

34223-st_paul.jpg	The seventeenth century was a very productive period for Spanish painting. Spain's extensive trade links brought with them an interchange of artistic ideas, particularly with Italy. Jusepe de Ribera played an important role in this. He began his studies with Ribalta but left Spain early on and went to Italy, where he discovered the work of Caravaggio. His style is characterized by strong light and shade, together with a realistic portrayal even of religious themes, as seen in his St Paul the Hermit of 1647

16929-death_v0.jpg	The major painting of Van der Goes's third period (between around 1478 and 1482) and very likely one of the last works he painted is the Death of the Virgin. The panel is almost square in shape. The scene is set in a totally enclosed room. The apostles are grouped around Mary's bed. The Virgin's fine blue robe contrast with the purple sheets that cover the bed. Her livid gray face is framed by the immaculate whiteness of her wimple, and of the cushion on which her head rests. Her hands are joined, her fingers look quite bony. Her eyes have lost their lustre. She looks up one last time towards the heavens, where her Son appears to her in His glory with arms outstretched, to display the wounds in his hands. He is dressed in a blue robe and a large red cloak held up by two angels. The picture represents the moment at which life has already gently slipped away, but death has not yet completed its work.The painter uses the apostles to ring the changes on the different varieties of grief, and their profound sadness contrasts with the detachment of the Virgin herself. Their clothes have been creased into countless shifting folds which cut across one another at right angles. Van der Goes is revealed as a penetrating analyst of religious feeling, of grief and devotion, and of the agitation they can cause. This work, like all those he painted during his last period, represents the eruption of sacred experience into a profane world. The artist achieves this through an abundant use of colours which strike the viewer as unreal, as if they were themselves transfigured. In this way, Van der Goes seeks to identify his painting with the mystery of transcendence itself.To this end too, the gestures of his figures are emphatic. He uses techniques or the progressive reduction of pictorial space and the transformation of figures, which he paints half-length, not full length

04806-cremona4.jpg	The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht D�rer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy D�rer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.In the Meeting at the Golden Gate, the tender embrace of Joachim and Anna is united by the arch of the gate over their heads. On the left a series of portrait figures, perhaps the rulers and their entourage, occupies the pictorial space

03068-hersemer.jpg	Ovid (Met. 2:708-832) tells how three sisters, returning from the festival of Minerva and carrying her sacred baskets on their heads, were espied by Mercury who immediately fell in love with the most beautiful of them, Herse. Another of the sisters, Aglauros, was consumed with envy, and tried to prevent Mercury entering Herse's chamber when he came to her one night. He touched Aglauros with his wand and she turned to black stone, the colour of her thoughts.The present playful and sensuous representation of the story is similar both in style and theme to a number of others executed by van Balen and his circle. Van Balen was specialised in small cabinet pictures which often depicted mythological scenes.

13020-porziaim.jpg	During his trip to Italy and in particular when he was living in Genoa, Anthony van Dyck painted many portraits of members of patrician families. These were strongly influenced by those that Peter Paul Rubens had produced for the same families almost two decades earlier. From these Van Dyck borrowed the structures and the chromatic oppositions between the dark, court clothing and the bright ruffs, embroideries and jewels. The painting in the Brussels museum is a good example of this type of official representation.Porzia Imperiale and her daughter Maria Francesca belonged to a family of Genoese bankers. On 5 August 1610 the mother married Bartolomeo Imperiale, probably a distant cousin. Born in around 1586, she must have been between 35 and 40 when Anthony van Dyck stayed in Genoa. Maria Francesca's date of birth is not known, but the inscription Virtute gaudet (she rejoices in virtue) on the virginal, exalting the young girl's honour, shows that she was of marriageable age. Women occupied a special place in the Republic of Genoa. It is therefore not surprising to see them associated with Virtue, a quality with heroic connotations that is more generally ascribed to men.Porzia Imperiale, seated here, is dressed in a black gown, its severity softened by an imposing ruff, a double chain, engraved buttons and lace-edged cuffs. In her left hand she carries a closed fan, whilst her right hand rests on the arm of the chair. Her daughter wears a light-coloured gown with silvery reflections, decorated with gilded braid and a ruff, its moir� reflections very finely balancing the dark mass of her mother's gown. Porzia Imperiale's determined face contrasts with Maria Francesca's gentle and innocent looks. The background architectural details and the heavy red drapery confer a monumental aspect to the painting, further accentuated by the way in which the figures literally dominate the spectator, who views them from a low-angle position. The subtlety with which Van Dyck renders the different dark nuances is proof of an uncommon skill

10011-herdemo1.jpg	This painting and its companion piece, Cheerful Democritus, depict two men with diametrically opposed views of the world. The subjects of the paintings are the Greek philosophers Democritus of Abdera and Heraclitus of Ephesus.  Their views of life could not have been more different:  Democritus never stopped laughing at the follies of humankind while Heraclitus wept continuously over the condition of the world. There are numerous representations of them in Greek and Roman art and literature, but the theme fell out of favour in post-classical art and was not revived until the late 15th century. By about 1600 Democritus and Heraclitus once again became a popular subject, particularly in the Netherlands, and the philosophers are depicted either in pairs or a single composition.

Its style is strongly influenced by Caravaggio, particularly in its formal aspects: the strong chiaroscuro reaches an extreme degree in the faces of the three figures. At the same time, the painting also demonstrates the interest in depicting everyday life so characteristic of the art of northern Europe, and takes pleasure in painting the details of the clothing and objects.The composition of the scene and the descending ray of light that isolates the three youths in the darkness reflect the influence of the tavern and gambling scenes painted by Bartolomeo Manfredi and Valentin de Boulogne and other early followers of Caravaggio

39134-02zianig.jpg	Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo decorated with frescoes the family villa at Zianigo which his father, Giovanni Baptista Tiepolo had bought on his return from the task of decorating the Prince-Bishop's palace in W�rzburg and which he had restored and altered to his own needs. The frescoes were painted over a fairly long period of time: between 1759 - the date shown on one of the monochrome scenes from the chapel - and 1797 - according to a now lost inscription read at the beginning of the twentieth century in a mural scene in the Pulcinella Room. Almost all the frescoes in the small Zianigo villa were detached in 1906 and in 1936 they were moved to the Ca' Rezzonico and placed in small rooms, in a recomposition that closely repeats the original one, though with some differences and overlapping.The frescoes in the villa depict the stories of Pulcinella (also Punchinello, a classical character that originated in the Commedia dell'arte of the 17th century), scenes of villa life, games, the wars and affections of satyrs and fauns. It is a comprehensive cycle which Giovanni Domenico painted for himself in successive stages in the non-monumental rooms of the country house. When completed, the whole Zianigo work was a kind of grand recapitulation of many aspects and idiosyncrasies of Giovanni Domenico's art, while also representing the cultural passing of a period and a style. It is almost a pictorial testament which, while valuing the past, did not conceal the drama of the present nor the uncertainty of the future

26068-18portra.jpg	The tightly framed composition of this portrait makes it one of the most compact images ever painted by Memling. The solid head occupies virtually the entire width of the painting, with more than half of the shoulders and hands cut off the edge. The sensation of extreme proximity is exceptionally strong. The viewpoint is so low that the flat landscape, with a little church in the distance, can barely be discerned above the subject's shoulders, while his head stands out monumentally against the sky. The broadly drawn, wispy clouds appear to be a later addition. The man wears a dark jacket lined with white fur, flecked with brown, and an asymmetrical collar over a red waistcoat. The wider right lapel is folded over, and if fastened would reach high above its counterpart. A small crucifix set with pearls hangs from a golden chain, half beneath and half on top of the collar. The young man in London's National Gallery has a similar piece of jewellery, which he wears in the same way. It must have been a common ornament, because a version of it also appears in the Bruges Portrait of a young woman and in the allegorical figure of a girl in New York. The man's devotion is evidently directed towards a lost representation, probably of the Virgin and Child.When closed, this diptych would have displayed the coat-of-arms that is still to be found on the reverse. The man probably belonged to the Lespinette family (Franche-Comt�). Since its auction (as a work by Antonello da Messina) in 1894, the painting has been accepted as a Memling. It is generally compared with his portraits from the 1480s, and shows a particular similarity in its modelling to the Bruges Portrait of a young woman of 1480.It is understandable that some people should have been inclined to attribute this admirable portrait to Antonello, such is its precision and assurance of drawing and modelling of the face; but in the features, which are as though engraved, and the pointed steeple visible in the background, give a Flemish character of this picture

10989-213david.jpg	If little else were known of David, the self-portrait that he painted in May 1791 certainly looks the image of a Romantic. Painted rapidly, with a spontaneous touch, it shows an excited, even wild young man, with freely curling hair, eyes aglow with almost visionary zeal. He is looking slightly dishevelled and with a piercing gaze, very different from the normally relaxed pose of his sitters and perhaps an indication of the internal conflicts that eventually led him to become a fully committed Republican

07498-22barber.jpg	The still undeveloped features of this young cleric, who later became Pope Urban VIII (1623-1644) were portrayed as a much more distinguished figure by the skills of Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598-1680).

42079-jacob.jpg	In this painting Varotari depicts a scene from the biblical story of Jacob. It shows Jacob telling Rachel and Leah that he wishes to leave Laban's service. Jacob urges Rachel and Leah to leave with him.According to the Bible, Leah becomes Jacob's wife through a deception on the part of her father, Laban. In the Biblical account, Jacob is dispatched to the hometown of Laban - the brother of his mother Rebekah - to avoid being killed by his brother Esau, and to find a wife. Out by the well, he encounters Laban's younger daughter Rachel tending her father's sheep, and decides to marry her. Laban is willing to give Rachel's hand to Jacob as long as he works seven years for her. On the wedding night, however, Laban switches Leah for Rachel. Later Laban claims that it is uncustomary to give the younger daughter away in marriage before the older one. Laban offers to give Rachel to Jacob in marriage in return for another seven years of work. Jacob accepts the offer and marries Rachel after the week-long celebration of his marriage to Leah

13660-adorati.jpg	The Adoration of the Magi, is one of the fourteen panels from the altarpiece of the Chancel in Viseu Cathedral, and the earliest dated work of the artist. It  is a key work in the evaluation of the impact which the painting and the painters from southern parts of the Low Countries had on the taste of patrons and on the work of painters in Portugal. Despite the controversy surrounding its authorship, everything points to a team, led by the Flemish painter Francisco Henriques, joined locally by the young Vasco Fernandes, elaborating the altarpiece for the bishop of Viseu.The Adoration of the Magi includes iconographic details which confirm that the altarpiece was made locally.  The black Wise King, Balthasar, is replaced by an Indian from Brazil. The closeness in time of this artistic representation (the first in Western art) to the discovery of the lands of the True Cross (Brazil) gives it an extraordinary historical value

26601-2ceil_ve.jpg	"In planning the architectural design Michelangelo first had to accommodate his program to the pre-existing building, including the windows, which were the source of light for his decoration. The wreath of openings still provides the principal viewing light.Michelangelo devised a long central area framed by a fictive marble cornice and separated into nine sections by broad pilaster strips bent across the ceiling, also in imitation white marble. Sections of alternating dimensions are framed between wider and narrower bands. Within them Michelangelo varied the size of the actual narratives, giving only the smaller ones a marble frame. Four ignudi (male nudes), among the most admired elements of the ceiling, ostensibly support ribbons attached to large medallions painted to look like bronze. Twenty in all, they are in different poses, producing, together with the Prophets and Sibyls, a ""handbook"" of alternatives for the seated figure for later artists.At the corners of the ceiling Michelangelo has painted four salvation subjects, including David and Goliath and Judith and Holofernes. Triangular-shaped compartments are repeated in a continuous band along the entire border of the ceiling; they contain bronze-colored nudes that alternate with the renowned Prophets and Sibyls set into marble thrones which, in turn, have paired marble putti in a variety of poses and positions that expand upon the tradition of Donatello and Luca della Robbia. The ancestors of Christ are painted on the flat side walls, the only section of the decoration that did not require the visual adjustments posed by painting on a curved surface"

26107-29jerome.jpg	This small panel was only discovered relatively recently (1945) and so does not feature in most of the Memling literature. Nevertheless, it is an interesting little work which corresponds fully with Memling's style and spatial approach. The composition derives from Rogier van der Weyden. It portrays the episode in which Jerome removes the thorn from the lion's paw. The architectural setting is a characteristic Memling invention. The scene is viewed through a heavy round arch in brown stone, positioned at an angle close to the picture plane. It is related to the more modest little arches in the wings containing the Allegory of True Love. The fairly heavily dotted little trees in the background also recall that work.The odd way the image is cropped to the left and right is not the result of its having been narrowed at some stage, but is in fact deliberate. The angled position of the arch might indicate that this was once a left wing. The panel has been cut off at the top and bottom. Considering the size of the figure and the wooded landscape, it could be a side panel for the St Jerome in Basel
