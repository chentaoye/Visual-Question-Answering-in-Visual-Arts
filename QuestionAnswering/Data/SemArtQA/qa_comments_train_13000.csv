08164-immacul1.jpg	At the end of his career Castiglione produced ecstatic compositions of great intensity, reminiscent of Bernini's style of these years. One of the few documented paintings in Castiglione's career, the present Immaculate Conception was executed for the high altar of the new Capuchin church in Osimo, a small town in central Italy. The artistic genius and professional success of the Genoese painter was often overshadowed by the artist's difficult and violent personality. He reportedly threw his sister off a rooftop, sent his brother to jail, and nearly murdered his nephew in a fistfight. Yet he produced religious pictures of stunning grandeur and inspiration

06464-11calvar.jpg	This is the largest known painting by Bruegel. For Bruegel the composition is unusually traditional. Perhaps because he was treating such a solemn religious event, he adopted a well-known scheme, used previously by Bruegel's Antwerp contemporary, Pieter Aertsen. Christ's insignificance among the crowds is a familiar device of Mannerist painting, as is the artificial placing of Mary and her companions in a rocky foreground, which is deliberately distanced from the dramatic events taking place behind them.Standing on a small hill in the foreground, the grieving friends of Christ are separated from the teeming detail of this scene, with Christ carrying the cross at its centre, and are thus brought closer to the viewer. The style of their depiction, going back to Rogier van der Weyden's paintings, also removes them from the more contemporary representation of the crowd. St John and the saint on the right (and the two mourners a little further back) originated in Rogier's Deposition (Prado, Madrid), which Bruegel can have known only from copies, since the painting itself had been taken to Spain around the middle of the 16th century.In the background, we can make out a Flemish Jerusalem on the left and the hill of Calvary on the right, with a rock and windmill of unknown significance between them

26116-33nieuw.jpg	The left panel shows the Virgin and Child, while the right is the portrait of the donor Maarten van Nieuwenhove, a nobleman in Bruges. This work dates from the same year as the Benedetto Portinari triptych and is closely related to it in terms of style and typology. With the exception of the example in Chicago, it is the only portrait diptych to survive intact.In the Virgin of the left wing, the features of the Virgin in van der Weyden's Columba Altarpiece can be seen, with her slightly tilted head and soft facial features almost frozen in gentle humility. In Memling's picture the Virgin and Child seem more animated, their gestures more natural. Christ, depicted in a pose similar to the same figure in van der Weyden's work, reaches eagerly for the apple held by his mother. This gesture expresses the acceptance of his later Passion, which was necessary to redeem humanity from original sin (symbolized by the apple).This panel shows Memling's mastery of a rich vocabulary of allusions in the Flemish tradition of a van Eyck. As in the Arnolfini Marriage, a convex mirror hangs on the wall behind the Virgin and captures the entire scene. We can see the nobleman at prayer and the Virgin at his side. His holy vision has become a reality through the painter's art, which, in a metaphorical sense, is a witness to the event. The form of the diptych separates the levels of meaning: the sacred images of the Virgin and Child are on one side and a secular portrait of the donor on the other. However, these levels of meaning are embedded in a unified and domestic space which envelops both panels - a real room in the house of a prosperous nobleman. The divine sphere has been shown to enter the sphere of this Bruges nobleman's everyday world.The original frame states the name and age of the donor, together with the date. He is Maarten van Nieuwenhove, portrayed in 1487 when he was 23. He was born on 11 November 1463 to a prominent Bruges family, several members of which held important civic posts (burgomaster, councilor, municipal treasurer) or worked for Maximilian of Austria. Links with the latter were to cost Maarten's brother Jan his head in 1488. Maarten was a councilor in 1492 and 1494, captain of the civic guard in 1495 and 1498 and burgomaster in 1497. He died on 16 August 1500, as recorded by his tombstone in the family chapel in the Church of Our Lady. He was evidently still unmarried at the time the painting was commissioned. His future bride, Margareta Haultain, was to outlive him by twenty years. His coat-of-arms and motto IL YA CAVSE are incorporated in the stained-glass window behind the Virgin. The window also features four medallions containing a vivid emblem that illustrates his family name: a hand sowing seeds over a garden of flowers (Nieuwenhove = new garden). Maarten's patron saint, St Martin, is represented behind him, again in the form of a stained-glass window. The medallions showing St George and St Christopher to the Virgin's right might be personally chosen protectors. The view through the window to the rear of the portrait appears to show the Minnewater bridge in Bruges.Although the painting is not signed, Memling's authorship has never been doubted

The Virgin and Child with Four Angels in the centre was flanked by pairs of saints (Sts Benedict and Nicholas of Bari and St John the Baptist and an Evangelist, probably St Matthew). The predella showed scenes from the life of St Nicholas, of which five are known: the birth of the saint; pilgrims at the shrine of the saint; St Nicholas resuscitating three youths; the saint providing dowries for three sisters (three gold balls, his traditional attribute); and banishing the storm.

03276-adoratio.jpg	This altarpiece was commissioned for the cathedral of Siena.Bartolo di Fredi was one of the most popular masters in Siena in the second half of the fourteenth century. He maintained a large workshop. He was influenced by both Simone Martini and Pietro Lorenzetti, and following late Gothic inspirations he developed his style on this basis.The Adoration of the Magi is characterized by a lively dynamism like in Lorenzetti's paintings. The only tranquil detail is Mary sitting with the Child on the right side. The three kings arrive with a big accompaniment from the left. The big striped hats in the hands of the members of the accompaniment is well known from the St Martin fresco cycle of Simone Martini in Assisi. The background scene is a reference to the long journey of the kings between cities and mountains. The walled city is Siena with the black and white striped Cathedral and the bell-tower.

12965-charles1.jpg	This painting, commissioned by the King, is one of the masterpieces of the artist. It is one of the great equestrian portraits Van Dyck made of Charles I. They glorify the absolute ruler Charles I wished to be. This emphasis has given these pictures a pronounced propagandist quality, which would have been even more obvious to anyone seeing them in the places for which they were originally intended, in prominent positions in royal residences. Artist and patron must both have had such examples in mind as Titian's Charles V at M�hlberg, the most influential Renaissance equestrian portrait of a victorious monarch. However, Van Dyck's portrait is more intimate in character. The fine, Venetian-inspired landscape setting, and the relaxed attitude of the king and his companion accord very well with the popularity of pastoral subject matter in contemporary literature and visual arts.

38298-spaniel.jpg	The painting is signed and dated lower right: Geo: Stubbs / pinxit 1776.Dog portraiture began in France at the court of Louis XV, who commissioned portraits of his favourite houndshunting scenes of Frans Snyders. In England, where the emphasis in hunting was increasingly being placed upon the performance of individual hounds, which led to intense rivalry among the landed elite, this was reflected in the paintings of John Wootton and Peter Tillemans; the former of whom in particular started to produce portraits of dogs in the mid eighteenth century. Fine examples of Wootton's work in this manner include the mock heroic portrait of Horace Walpole&#146;s favourite dog Patapan, painted in 1743. However, it was Stubbs, a generation later, who really developed the genre, working, as he was, at a time when dogs were becoming increasingly valued not only as sporting trophies, but as objects of interest in themselves. By the late eighteenth century, the dog had gained a new status as a prized possession within English households which it had not formerly enjoyed. Stubbs's highly sensitive paintings of these animals are executed with infinite attention to detail and are possessed with boundless character and charm. Whilst they are seldom uninteresting as paintings, at their best they are small masterpieces

39442-5maggio1.jpg	The present decoration of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) was realized after the disastrous fire of 1577 during which all the structures of the ship's-keel Gothic ceiling and the wall-paintings were destroyed. An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings. The canvases were dedicated, thematically, to the Glorification of Venice, in remembrance of the numerous military undertakings in the East or on the mainland by the Venetian ground troops.

24938-bielefe.jpg	One of the key monuments of late medieval painting in Westphalia, completed in 1400, the altarpiece probably made for the high altar of the former Kollegiatstift Sankt Maria und Sankt Georg, now the Neust&#228;dter Marienkirche in Bielefeld, was a triptych with folding wings about 6,56 maters wide when fully opened and about 2,18 meters high, including its lost frame. In the open state, it displayed a large central image of the Virgin and Child enthroned in the company of saints, flanked by thirty smaller scenes ranging from God Warns Adam about the Tree of Knowledge, through the life of the Virgin Mary and the Passion of Christ, to the Last Judgment, all on gold ground. The small scenes were arranged in three rows of ten, with the subjects progressing chronologically across each row, skipping over the Virgin and Child at centre, from the upper left to the lower right. The folding wings displayed nine scenes each, the rest of the small scenes belonged structurally to the central panel and were thus immobile. The lost exterior decoration of the wings was probably painted either with standing saints or nonfigural ornaments.The central section remains in the Marienkirche in Bielefeld. The retable was dismantled in the course of church renovations in 1840-41 and the wings were cut and divided into the individual scenes now found at various collections (Staatliche Museen, Berlin; Oetker Collection, Bielefeld; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford)

14979-tahiti25.jpg	"In a letter to his friend Daniel de Monfreid in Paris, written in December 1892, Gauguin described this work and two smaller canvases: ""I believe they are my best, and since it will be the first of January in several days I have dated one, the best, 1893. Exceptionally, I gave it a French title: Pastorales Tahitiennes, not finding a corresponding title in the language of the South Seas.""The importance of titles to all the works Gauguin produced in Tahiti should not be overlooked, especially since they were usually written prominently in large letters. These add a further dimension to his paintings and demonstrate his attempts to woo a Parisian audience with whimsical, allusive names that conjure up visions of an idyllic existence, in which the figures roam freely in a strangely timeless setting"

18780-guard403.jpg	In May 1782, Pope Pius VI visited the city of Venice. The ceremonies and festivities on that occasion were recorded by Francesco Guardi in a series of four paintings. The city council commissioned Guardi to make four paintings representing the following subjects: the arrival of the pontiff near San Giorgio in Alga, the papal mass in SS Giovanni e Paolo, the papal audience and the blessing of the people on Campo SS Giovanni e Paolo.In this scene, the blessing of the people on the square before the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo is shown. To the right is the large Dominican church of Santi Giovanni and Paolo, with Verrocchio's equestrian statue of Colleoni in front of it. Our view of the fa�ade of the Scuola Grande di San Marco in the background is partly obstructed by a temporary wooden platform with double stairs and a balcony. On the left we see the houses and palazzi on the Rio dei Mendicanti. The canal itself has been covered with planks to provide more room for the spectators. The large crowd attending the ceremony dominates the foreground of the painting. The picture is considered the most important of the different versions of the scene, which appears to be based on a composition by Canaletto.Pope Pius VI visited Venice from 15 till 19 May 1782, returning from an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to the Austrian emperor Joseph II in Vienna. Large-scale festivities were organized in Venice in honour of the distinguished guest. At his arrival in the city, the Pope was welcomed by the Doge and the Signoria; the following day he held an audience and was honoured with music recitals, held in part in his absence. The highpoint of the festivities was the blessing of the people on Pentecost, the day on which the Pope was scheduled to leave. On the square before SS Giovanni e Paolo, the monastery where the Prince of the Church had taken up residence, a wooden platform had been constructed. Flanked by the ruling Doge, Paolo Renier, and by the Patriarch of Venice, and accompanied by spiritual and secular dignitaries, the pontiff blessed the assembled people. The papal blessing was actually to have taken place on Piazza San Marco, but because many shops and stands would have had to be removed for the occasion, it was decided to move the ceremony to the square in front of the Dominican church. In order to preserve something of the atmosphere of the Piazza nonetheless, an attempt was made to recall the fa�ade of the basilica of San Marco in the design of the wooden construction.The paintings that Guardi made of the festivities are among his few works that are securely documented and dated. Guardi prepared his depiction of the papal benediction with great care. Several drawn and painted studies of the platform before the Scuola di San Marco are known, while a remarkable combination of two drawings provides more information about the working method of the painter.This series of paintings forms the last great manifestation of a rich tradition of depictions of Venetian festivities and ceremonies

43944-1deposi1.jpg	"The earliest painting that can be ascribed to Rogier van der Weyden with any certainty is also the artist's greatest and most influential extant work: the great Deposition. It cannot have been painted very long after 1435, the year established by dendrochronological dating methods, which would also fit the circumstances of Rogier's life at the time. On the other hand, it must have been painted before 1443, the date of the earliest copy (in the Sint-Pieterskerk, Leuven). The Deposition was an altarpiece, intended for the chapel of the Confraternity of the Archers of Leuven, who commissioned it. (The two small crossbows in the lower spandrels of the tracery in the picture refer to the Confraternity.). Mary of Hungary (1505-1558), Regent of the Netherlands, acquired the painting from the Archers of Leuven before 1548. Later it came into the possession of her nephew King Philip II of Spain (1527-1598; king from 1556), who finally placed it in the monastery fortress of the Escorial he had founded near Madrid. At that time the Deposition formed the centre of a triptych, but there is no indication that the side wings were originally part of the work, it is more likely that the Deposition was originally a single panel.At about 2.2 meters high and 2.6 meters wide, the painting is very large by the usual standards of Early Netherlandish pictures; in terms of concept it is truly monumental. Ten figures in all cover the painted surface almost entirely, with their heads close to the upper edge of the panel. The body of Jesus has already been removed from the Cross, and is received by two elderly men, the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus. Surrounded by Jesus's mourning friends they are holding His dead body for a moment before setting it down. Mary is sinking to the ground in a faint beside her son, and is supported by John, the favourite disciple of Jesus, and by one of the holy women. On the extreme right, the despairing Mary Magdalene seems on the brink of collapse.The scene shown would have lasted for only a moment, but there is nothing momentary about its depiction, which is quite detached from the historical event. Rogier achieves this effect principally by placing the group in a painted niche like an altar shrine; the hill of Golgotha, the Place of Skulls where the Cross stood, is suggested only by skulls and arm bones on the narrow strip of stone floor. A connection is thus established with those gilded shrines holding painted statues that were a particularly costly and lavish form of retable. However, Rogier was not imitating a carved altar. He shows ""live"" figures rather than statues, and the life-like effect is emphasized by their appearance, almost life-size, in the place where mere wooden statues would be expected in an altar. Using such methods, Rogier gives them the three-dimensionality of statues but the look of a painting, which is much more life-like than sculpture.However, such considerations would have played only a minor part in Rogier's decision to set the scene in the painted altar niche. His primary concern was to emphasize the forcefulness of the depiction. Rogier even departs deliberately from what can be rationally imagined, and so breaks with the manner of realistic spatial depiction that had only recently been achieved in painting. The niche he paints is deep enough at the bottom of the picture to accommodate several figures, the upright of the Cross, and the ladder leaning against it; but in some areas at the top it seems to come close to the surface of the picture - the helper on the ladder is pressed tightly into the shallow upper space of the shrine, while the head of the bearded Joseph of Arimathaea just below seems to protrude from the picture. All the figures are brought forward by the golden back wall so that the space surrounds them closely: convincing as their actions may look individually, there would never really have been room for them all. The result is a sense of timelessness and an almost oppressive intensity.The painted niche offered Rogier another advantage: he could retain the gold background usual in medieval painting without offending against the demands of naturalistic depiction. The background of the painting is, in fact, a real gilded surface and also a pictorial representation of one - the back of the shrine.Rogier relates the figures to each other in a masterly composition, yet he emphasizes a number of different accents. The limp body of Christ is at the centre, and appears to be held quite naturally by the two men so that it is almost facing the observer, with hardly anything else encroaching on it. This is the part of the picture intended to inspire the greatest reverence, referring to the sacrament in which, in the Catholic faith, the host and the wine become the body and blood of Christ. During divine service the bread and wine would have stood on the altar below this picture, and when the priest raised the host above his head during the ceremony, the congregation would have seen him doing so directly in front of the painted body of Christ.The almost radiant body is immaculate and beautiful, undisfigured by the marks of scourging, and its delicate but almost swelling form has a distinctly sensuous softness. Only the marks of the five wounds are ugly gashes running with blood. However, the long trickle from the wound in Christ's side passes over the body like a delicate line that traces the curve of the stomach.The other main character in the picture is Mary. The Mother of God, sinking to the ground as if dead, forms a parallel to Christ, allowing the artist to create a link between the two main groups in a bold effect of composition, since they are moving in different directions: Christ is being carried away to the right, while Mary is falling to the left. At the same time, the correspondence between the figures illustrates an important theological idea of the time Mary's own compassionate suffering and her part in Christ's act of redemption. On the right of the picture not directly involved in the action, stands Mary Magdalene. Her magnificent, worldly garments, with the low-necked dress showing her full, sensuous breasts, indicate that she is the ""great sinner"" who has abandoned her depraved way of life and turned to Christ in repentance. In terms of composition, the Magdalene's figure closes off the picture on the right like a large bracket, matching the similarly bowed figure of John on the left. The curve of Mary Magdalene's cloak, sweeping forward into the picture, is echoed by the hem of the brocade robe worn by Nicodemus, and is continued in the left half of the picture by the folds in the Virgin Mary's blue dress. Such overlapping forms and lines determine the structure of the whole picture: the curve of Christ's body is continued in the Magdalene's left arm, and is crossed by the diagonal running in the opposite direction from the eyes of Nicodemus, through the hands of Christ and Mary, to the eye sockets of the skull. Christ's left arm too echoes the movements that seem to curve and turn on each other at the centre of the picture.The Deposition is among the outstanding masterpieces of Netherlandish art, and one of the mainstays of Rogier's fame. As the work of a painter aged 35 to 40, it can hardly be described as a youthful production, yet only with this painting can we begin to see Rogier more clearly as an artistic personality. Most important of all, the picture shows unmistakable similarities with some of the major works of the Master of Fl�malle"

25042-1table.jpg	In a partially lit environment, a table is seen from slightly above. Placed on the table are two vases of flowers and a basket of fruit arranged in a triangle and surrounded by single pieces of fruit scattered at random. Two flies can be seen on the brightly lit wall at the upper left, and, in the foreground, some fruit and two bunches of grapes hang over the edge of the table creating a trompe-l'oeil effect. The painting aims for the same heightened sense of reality seen in Caravaggio's Boy with a Basket of Fruit. This Table (a more appropriate title than the conventional Still-life with Flowers and Fruit) shares a number of affinities with the depictions of tables laid for eating painted in Holland throughout the seventeenth century. It may be no coincidence that the first dated painting of this type from 1610 was the work of Floris van Dijck. In 1600-01 Van Dijck lived near the studio of Cavaliere d'Arpino, where pictures like the Hartford still-life were probably executed. It was Van Dijck who supplied the information about Cavaliere d'Arpino for Karel van Mander's biography.The Hartford Table has elicited attributions of enormous diversity. The names of Giovanni Battista Crescenzi, Caravaggio, Francesco Zucchi, Prospero Orsi and finally, for no very convincing reason, the Flemish painter Frans Snyders have all been suggested. Although the attribution to Caravaggio does not seem tenable, the Hartford Table is the work of a painter who, like Caravaggio, may have been active in the studio of Cavaliere d'Arpino. It is possible that the picture can be identified with an unattributed still-life listed in the 1607 inventory of Cavaliere d'Arpino's sequestered possessions. In the first decade of the seventeenth century, this anonymous painter was evidently completely familiar with the work of Caravaggio, but chose to present his own, different interpretation of it. It has also been suggested that this Italian artist, who was influenced by Caravaggism, also possessed some familiarity with the work of the first generation of Flemish still-life painters.

38592-worksmer.jpg	The Works of Mercy, a famous theme drawn from the Gospel of St Matthew, listing six kinds of charitable deeds (to which, in the thirteenth century, was added the burial of the deceased), was highly appreciated by Teniers or by his clientele: at least five other versions of that theme had been recorded in the painters's work. Its imagery had been widely diffused in the painting of the former Lowlands since the fifteenth century. The seven works of mercy prescribed the Christian's fundamental duties towards his fellow-creatures: quench the thirsty, feed the hungry, dress the naked, welcome the pilgrims, visit the sick and the prisoners and bury the dead.

32207-12flora.jpg	Two pictures that are very much more Venetian in their inspiration are the Munich Apollo and Daphne and the Louvre Triumph of Flora, whose subjects are taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Throughout his career Poussin liked to dwell on themes of transformation, especially those found in stories from classical antiquity. Apollo pursues Daphne, and to escape his clutches she is transformed into a laurel tree. The theme has a poetic melancholy, and this melancholy is also present to a certain extent in the much more cheerful Flora.Flora is the ancient Italian goddess of flowers. Her triumphal procession is led by Venus, Flora rides on a chariot drawn by putti. The painting represents Poussin's first attempt to portray Flora surrounded by the individuals who, according to Ovid's Metamorphoses, turn into plants and thus form the retinue of the goddess of flowers. Although the colours have greatly darkened over the course of time, thanks to a copy in better condition in Rome, we know that the palette of The Triumph of Flora was indeed less sophisticated than that of the later Empire of Flora

33004-05farnes.jpg	The myth of Cupid and Psyche is depicted on the loggia of Agostino Chigi's villa. Cupid fell in love with the daughter of a king, but had to remain unrecognized by her, and so came to her only at night. After Psyche had undergone many difficult trials, Zeus made her immortal, and allowed her to marry Cupid. The unusual subject seems to be a reference to the much yearned for marriage between Chigi and Francesca Ordeaschi, with whom he already had four children. The ceremony took place on 28 August 1519.The conclusion of the Psyche story takes place in two broad format paintings in the vault panel. Raphael places these scenes in an illusionistic tapestry that appears to be hung between the garlands. Thus the artist avoids the extreme foreshortening that would have been required of an illusionistic prospect of the sky in this same place. On the right Raphael depicts the council of the gods in which Jupiter decides to accept Psyche and mercury gives her the drink of immortality. Then the wedding is celebrated in the painting on the left. The groupings of figures spread out before us like antique reliefs; the communal life of the gods is unfolded for us in a witty characterization of their all too human feelings

15317-1vault.jpg	"The picture shows the nave vault with Mary scenes in three centre canvas paintings: the Presentation of Mary in the Temple. Annunciation to the Virgin, Assumption of the Virgin.A narrative scene painted on a wall as a framed picture was referred to as a ""quadro riportato,"" which to seventeenth-century thinking suggested that a framed panel painting had been translated into the medium of fresco. If a picture with the perspective of a panel painting is shifted to the ceiling, it is called a ""quadro finto"" (fictitious picture). In such a case the painted architectural framing is replaced by a painted or three-dimensional picture frame.Another solution for ceiling decoration was realized by Veronese in the Palazzo Ducale in Venice. He simply inserted his complex program of pictures structured in different sizes and shapes into the massive coffering system as true canvases. There are also mixed forms, in which pictures painted on canvas were inserted into a ceiling fresco as quadri riportati. Antonio Gherardi created an original example of this type  in the vault of Santa Maria Trivio in Rome. In a direct borrowing from Veronese, he presented scenes from the life of the Virgin from an extremely low vantage point in three oil paintings separated only by narrow strips of framing. The iconography of the central Assumption of the Virgin is almost unrecognizable because of the foreshortening, and even the other scenes executed in fresco in the caps of the vault and the spandrels are greatly deformed by the steep angle at which they are viewed from below. With his interpretation of church vaulting, Gherardi, though valued as an architect and worker in stucco, was unable to make his way as a painter in Rome"

08412-vision.jpg	The painting represents the mystical apparition of the Virgin Mary to St Felix of Cantalice, a humble Capuchin friar who died in Rome in 1587 and was beatified in 1625, and who had been venerated as a saint even before his death. The painting was commissioned by the nobleman Giuseppe Raspa, whose striking likeness at the age of eight-two is visible at lower right, next to the family crest. The patron's wrinkled face and long beard appear so truthful and alive that they project a shadow onto the parapet in the foreground that separates the divine space from the earthbound.

32063-cremona2.jpg	Located on the inner fa�ade of the cathedral, this is the most impressive of the murals of the Passion of Christ that were the contribution of Pordenone to the large-scale decorative cycle painted by various artists in Cremona cathedral. The ample space offered by the Romanesque building allowed Pordenone to give free rein to his violent, dramatic, and highly-charged theatrical vein. The composition has the air of a painterly whirlwind and was much appreciated by the public.It was a fundamental departure from the traditional way that Calvary had previously been shown. The muggy, storm-laden atmosphere conjures up amazing effects of light.The three crosses are arranged in an asymmetrical fashion and are viewed from an angle.The crowd mills around uncomfortably andthe dramatically foreshortened horses have an almost demonic look about them.The entire composition focuses around the tall mercenary at the centre. When he took over the job of painting the frescos in the cathedral of Cremona from Romanino, Pordenone revolutionized the local school

18695-1gods.jpg	Girolamo Godi, organizer of a Vicenzan literary salon and friend of Pietro Bembo and Alvise Cornaro, engaged Gualtiero around 1550 to decorate the villa. In addition to the loggia, the decoration of four rooms in the right wing of the villa can be ascribed to Gualtiero: the Hall of the Gods or the Putto, the Hall of the Triumphs, the Hall of the Caesars, and the Hall of the Sacrifices. Gualtiero's sudden death in 1552 prevented him from completing the work which was taken over by Battista Zelotti and Battista del Moro, who created the frescoes in the other rooms.Gualtiero worked with Lambert Sustris at the Villa dei Vescovi in Luvigliano in 1542-43, at the Villa Godi he revived compositional and decorative solutions that had already been tried out in that context. The Hall of the Gods was the first to be completed and the decoration shows striking similarities to the Luvigliano prototype. The ionic columns support architraves decorated with friezes inhabited by mythological deities.

19111-17heythu.jpg	This portrait, which was formerly dated about 1635 but upon the basis of style and costume should be dated about a decade earlier, is Hals's only known life-size, full-length. This type of portrait was not popular during the first half of the seventeenth century in Holland. It was one that was still primarily used for state portraits and the nobility; only the most powerful, the wealthiest or the most pretentious commissioned them. Moreover, few Dutch homes were large enough for them. But van Heythuyzen's residence was. Heythuyzen was a very rich merchant who made his great fortune in the city's textile industry, the principal source of Haarlem's prosperity after beer brewing.Even if nothing were known about van Heythuyzen's life there is no disputing it: Hals's portrait of him standing big as life captures the confidence and vitality of the burghers who made Holland the most powerful and richest nation in Europe during the first half of the seventeenth century. It is one of those rare pictures that seems to sum up an entire epoch. A sense of energy is conveyed by the tautness the artist gave to his model's bolt-upright figure. His extended leg does not dangle, but carries its full share of his weight. One arm just straight out, stiff as the sword he holds; the other makes a sharp angle from shoulder to elbow to hip, and even his knuckles take part in the taut, angular movement.As in most of Hals's portraits of the 1620s, the light falls with equal intensity on van Heythuyzen's alert head and on his hands. Shiny highlights and sharp shadows heighten the subject's palpable presence and the blended brushstrokes that model flesh are set off by adjacent areas where there are distinct, detached touches of brush. No portraitist before Hals dared use such a variety of brushstrokes in a formal portrait. The Van Dyckian props, a rarity in Hals's oeuvre, are beautifully worked into the design. The vertical accent of the pilaster on the right reinforces the figure's erect carriage, and the burgundy drapery is incorporated into the pattern formed by van Heythuyzen's elephantine pair of bouffant knee-breeches and cloak cut like a cape.The prominent roses in this portrait of a man who remained a bachelor could allude, as they do so often in paintings of the period, to the pleasures and pain of love, references in van Mander's 'Schilderboek' suggest that they and the lovers in the garden in its background were probably intended as reminders of life's transience

30641-stillife.jpg	When he published this painting at the end of the 1920s,  Roberto Longhi described it as an 'Unfinished meal - the carafe half-emptied, the melon and the water melon cut, the pear intact and the apple cut, and the flies jumping on their own shadows'. Longhi was at this time just beginning his research into Caravaggio and, in his view, the painting, which is impressive but really only of medium size, was by Caravaggio. Who else could have painted a masterpiece of such intensity and of such compositional excellence?Caravaggio's paternity in this case, however, was quite short-lived. By the 1950s the work had been attributed to an anonymous artist close to Carlo Saraceni named 'Pensionante del Saraceni'. Agreement on this attribution was almost unanimous, but it has not yet to a precise identification of the artist. His probable French nationality and his first-hand knowledge of Caravaggio appear to be the only secure information we have about him. The group of works attributed to him is tiny and the Washington painting is his only true still-life.In this still-life the table is covered with a silken cloth on which are placed a pear, a monumental slice of water melon, a melon, a plate of fruit and a glass carafe half full of white wine. Two flies buzz at a distance, but they could easily jump onto these recently abandoned leftovers. The dark background is one of the walls of a room, not just a backdrop as it is in the more or less contemporaneous painting in Rome attributed to the Master of the Hartford Still-life. In Pensionante's picture the few pieces of fruit and the splendid carafe reflecting the light possess an extraordinary presence. The soft, almost velvety light is unlike that in Caravaggio's youthful works. It dissolves the forms and multiplies the reflections in the shadows

36430-la_birds.jpg	Savery's painting, outmoded both in type and composition, adheres to the style of late Mannerism. Landscape as an imaginary combination of heterogeneous, natural and invented components, had by now been replaced by details of familiar surroundings, and animal images that seem to be taken straight from the pages of a zoological almanac had given way to portraits of domestic pets.Savery's painting calls for a close reading and an appreciative eye. His art lies in his scholarship and well-founded knowledge, reflecting the interest of the age in the natural sciences and exotic phenomena. The new Dutch painting, on the other hand, calls for a more sensually perceptive and contemplative approach. In its narrative, the landscape with birds is comparable to those Flemish floral still lifes which, for a period, presented botanic diversity in great detail. Savery's compositional form has its origins in the paradise portrayals of the 16th century, in which Adam and Eve are shown in harmony with the animal world around them. Picturesque ruins in the manner of Maerten van Heemskerck are also common features, soon to be adopted by the Italianate landscape painters. Savery's prolific drawings are spontaneous and precise, individual studies which he then transferred to his paintings.

09361-dedham1.jpg	"Constable was the son of a prosperous mill-owner in Suffolk, a county whose scenery became central to his work. Though he took painting lessons in Suffolk, he was largely self-taught. In 1795, he went to London and he entered the Royal Academy schools in 1799. As a student he copied Old Master landscapes, especially those of Jacob van Ruisdael.Though deeply impressed by the work of Claude Lorrain and the watercolours of Thomas Girtin, Constable believed the actual study of nature was more important than any artistic model. He refused to ""learn the truth second-hand."" To a greater degree than any other artist before him, Constable based his paintings on precisely drawn sketches made directly from nature. His early work also included portraits and some religious pictures, but from 1820 onwards he devoted himself almost exclusively to landscape painting. His subjects were found in the parts of England that he knew best, mainly Suffolk and Essex, and also Brighton"

28580-lazare2.jpg	At the beginning of 1877, Monet moved near to the Gare Saint-Lazare, of which he was subsequently to paint twelve different views. This was the first experiment that the artist had made with the technique of serial repetition of a motif, a way of working that was to become typical of him from the late 1880s onward.The newly constructed railway stations seemed to be an embodiment of the idea of modern, mobile, progressive living, a theme which the Impressionists had adopted in their works. Monet captured the fa�ade and the surroundings of the station, as well as the concourse with trains arriving at the platforms. However, he only made preliminary drawings from life. The oil paintings themselves were executed in the studio.By contrast with the usual interior views of the Gare Saint-Lazare, the present painting shows the gigantic iron and glass construction of the roof, with its apex placed symmetrically at the top of the picture on the vertical axis

31484-rosso.jpg	"The Palazzo Brignole Sale (dubbed Palazzo Rosso because of the colour of its stucco exterior) was erected between 1671 and 1679 on the prestigious Strada Nuova (present-day Via Garibaldi) in Genoa. The decoration of the palazzo was accomplished in two phases. In 1687-89 the team of Domenico Piola and Gregorio de Ferrari - with the assistance of Niccol&#242; di Viviano Codazzi (1642-1693), Antonio Maria Haffner (1654-1732) and Sebastiano Monchi (c. 1630-1706) - painted the east wing, including the south loggia, then in 1691-92 the frescoes in the rooms of the west wing were executed by Giovanni Andrea Carlone with the assistance of Antonio Maria Haffner and Carlo Antonio Tavella (1668-1738). The quadratura painter Antonio Maria Haffner worked both for the Piola-Ferrari and Carlone teams.The south loggia (shown in the photo) was painted by Paolo Gerolamo Piola together with Nicol&#242; Codazzi (1642-1693), the son of Viviano Codazzi. It is one of the few surviving examples of the typology of the ""room in ruins"" that so delighted a Baroque society fond of surprises. In the 1680s the Piola workshop had created a variant of the type in which the supposed ruin is neither a structure from antiquity nor one from centuries past, but a fully modern one. In the loggia of the Palazzo Rosso the simulated ruin is developed out of the actual structure: isolated chunks of the plaster and the cornice have fallen. The subject is a scene with the shepherd Endymion and the moon goddess Selene-Diana. Through an imaginary opening in the centre of the vault the goddess is floating down toward her sleeping lover"

31965-06madonn.jpg	As time passed Pontormo moved toward an increasingly personal conception of the human figure, with small oval heads and smallish features upon elongated but also rather robust bodies. In this altarpiece, the colours are more full-bodied and deeper than in the Deposition.The painting was executed for the convent of Sant'Anna in Verzaia, just outside Porta San Frediano in Florence. The theme of the Madonna and Child with St Anne, is especially revered in Florence, because of the expulsion of a tyrant ruler on St Anne's day. On 26 July, the saint's feast day, the painting marked the destination of a procession dedicated to the celebration of Florentine liberty.

06239-3tondo4.jpg	Four tondos with the Evangelists still adorn the pendentives that once supported the old cupola of the Cappella Capponi in the church of Santa Felicit&#224; in Florence. Except for the painting of St John, the precise authorship of the other three portraits has posed considerable problems for scholars. As Vasari only attributes two of the tondi to Bronzino, without specifying which, scholars are still divided over which and how many of them were painted by Bronzino, the apprentice to Pontormo. Probably Bronzino was responsible for the St Matthew with an intense gaze, half-closed mouth, and tousled red hair, painted with thickly laid-on and glowing brushstrokes and enlivened by the strong light that falls on the figure with a swirling crimson cloak, set against the dark background. Probably also Bronzino's is the St Mark with its palette of yellow and red tones contrasting with the green of the mantle wrapped around the figure, which looks as if it is peering through a window, an idea drawn from the Gospel.The bald St John with a long beard seems to share the same uneasy and sorrowful humanity lavished on the body of Christ in the Deposition by Pontormo in the same chapel, this tondo can certainly be attributed to Pontormo. St Luke is probably also a contribution by Pontormo.The figures of the Evangelists, with their distinctly Michelangiolesque flavour, have a vigour deriving from the way their heads are twisted and pushed forward. They are wrapped in ample robes, whose bold colours stand out against the dark backgrounds. This play of strong contrasts, which exalts the delicate outlines of the coloured surfaces, is in keeping with the refined style of the entire decoration of the chapel.

42250-0401vela.jpg	In 1630 the count-duke of Olivares decided to initiate a lavish program of artistic display by the construction of a new pleasure palace on the eastern border of Madrid which came to be known as the Buen Retiro. Here theatrical plays and spectacles would be staged, tournaments and jousts would be organized, and painting, sculpture, and tapestry would be displayed. Beginning in 1630 with a modest renovation of the royal apartment in San Jer�nimo, the project was expanded in 1632 and again in 1633, culminating in a sizable complex of buildings surrounded by enormous gardens adorned by fountains, alleys and hermitage chapels. Once the structure was finished, Olivares faced with the mammoth problem of decorating the new palace, a problem that was solved by hundreds of pictures from Italy and Flanders and by commissioning as many works from local artists as they could paint. As for the works by royal artists and their disciples, the decoration of the Retiro was the major event of the 1630s and thus is a microcosm of court painting during the decade.The Hall of Realms was the principal ceremonial room in the Buen Retiro Palace. Spanish palace decoration during the reign of Philip IV tended to be loosely programmed in comparison with Italian examples. However, the paintings in the Hall of realms, executed in 1634-35, offer an exception to the rule, for her the count-duke Olivares and his advisers invented a coherent, if straightforward program designed to magnify the power of the Spanish monarchy.The principal element are twelve paintings of important military victories of Philip IV's reign, which demonstrate the invincibility of Spanish arms. These are complemented by ten scenes of the life of Hercules, who was claimed by the Spanish Habsburgs (and virtually every other ruling house of Europe) as the founding ancestor of the dynasty. The final component is a group of equestrian portraits  of Philip III and Margaret of Austria, Philip IV and Isabella of Bourbon, and the heir to the throne, Baltasar Carlos, which embodies the idea of dynastic legitimacy and succession. From the 27 paintings the largest share went to Francisco de Zurbar�n, who painted the Hercules scenes and the Defence of Cadiz. Vel�zquez obtained all five equestrian portraits and the Surrender of Breda. Vicente Carducho obtained the commission for three battle painting, while his pupil F�lix Castelo was awarded one. Eugenio Caj�s and his assistants and followers were given four subjects. The two remaining works fell into the hands of Juan Bautista Maino and Antonio de Pereda.It was in 1625, ten years before this picture was painted, that Justin von Nassau, the commanding officer of Breda, surrendered the city to the Genoese Ambrosio Spinola, commander of the Spanish forces. Breda was one of the border fortresses of the Netherlands, a military base which had long been a bone of contention, alternately seized by the Spaniards or returned to the Princes of Orange. After a long siege Spinola learned from an intercepted letter that the defendants were in desperate straits, short of both equipment and food, and he therefore proposed that von Nassau should freely surrender rather than continue the bloodshed. The proposal was accepted and the army withdrew in good order, keeping their goods and some of their arms. The citizens did not suffer any harm at all. This victory was one of the last triumphs achieved by Spain in the period when she was accounted a great world power, and it was also one of the fine instances when humanism prevailed even in times of war.The main problem of a history painting featuring a large number of figures is the question of how to handle the crowd scenes. Vel�zquez initially tackles this difficulty by dividing the picture plane into two levels - a higher area of action on which the main event is acted out as on a stage, and an area below it in which we see the city and harbour of Breda and the sea. The stage-like situation is further emphasized by various foreground elements. The two military leaders - the defeated commandant of Breda handing over the keys of the fortress to the Spanish commander Spinola - are immediately recognizable as the protagonists because the view opens up behind them towards the otherwise hidden background, whereas to the right and left the respective military entourage is grouped like stage extras. Yet Vel�zquez does not portray them as anonymous soldiers. Amongst the group of Spanish victors brandishing their lances, we can make out just as many individual expressions of exhaustion as we can amongst the resigned group of defeated Dutch soldiers.It is thought that the composition of the picture derives from a contemporary book-illustration of the Bible; this is certainly true of the two central figures of the commanders.

21462-amburgh.jpg	Landseer was greatly admired as a painter of animals and to a certain degree his reputation rests on such pictures. Indeed, it was as an animal painter that he first came to the attention of Queen Victoria in 1836. Landseer's particular skills lay not just in accurate drawing (based on his early experience of dissection) and a convincing rendering of the characteristics of animals, but also in his ability to incorporate them into compositions. This was done in such a way that their presence often buttressed the narrative - if it was not historical - with a moralising or allegorical dimension.An important compositional feature of the painting is the positioning of the viewer inside the cage with the Spectators visible through the bars. Van Amburgh reclines in the cage surrounded by a tiger, a lion, a lioness and two leopards. He wears a coat of mail, presumably not as a form of protection but perhaps, judging by the footwear, as a form of costume (part Roman and part medieval). There are scratches on the skin of his right forearm and on his neck. The sheen on the coats of the animals reveals Landseer's superb technique, as in the balance between the underpaint and the highlight on the lioness, or the spots visible beneath the top layer of paint on the two leopards. Next to Van Amburgh is a lamb which no doubt heightened the drama of the performance, but it might also be seen as a biblical reference, as in the late work The Lion and the Lamb of 1871 (Johannesburg Art Gallery).The lion behind Isaac van Amburgh brings to mind the four bronze lions that were commissioned from Landseer towards the end of his life for the base of Nelson's col- umn in Trafalgar Square. The original commission was given to the artist in 1857, but it preoccupied him for ten years and the lions were unveiled in January 1867

21654-alexande.jpg	Louis XIV was interested in the story of Alexander the Great because of his own special type of megalomania could see itself reflected in the Greek past. Le Brun accordingly executed the truly colossal series of four canvasses depicting episodes from the life of Alexander the Great.This series - executed between 1662 and 1668 - was considered by the artist himself to be his masterpiece. The four paintings of the series are the Passage of the Granicus, the Battle of Argela, the Entry of Alexander into Babylon and Alexander and Porus. Like so many Herculean undertakings, the paintings impressed everybody by their sheer size. Later history has not been kind to them, but even so, tremendous energy burst out of every corner of these pictures, some of which are more than twelve metres long. The source, without any doubts, is Rubens. This is not the exuberant Rubens of the Medici cycle, but the Rubens of the vast hunting scenes and tapestry cartoons. Le Brun had in effect changed sides, as he moved from modest echoes of Poussin to a full-blown eulogy of Rubens

36326-madchild.jpg	"Saraceni executed this altarpiece for the first altar to the right in the Church of San Simeone Profeta, which was reconstructed and decorated by Cardinal Lancellotti in 1610. The canvas came to the museum in 1929, following the suppression of the church. Scholars agree on attributing it to Saraceni, and as the commission is securely datable it constitutes (along with the Frascati Rest on the Flight into Egypt, securely dated to 1606) an important point of reference for the reconstruction of the painter's first Roman period.Compared to the 1606 Frascati canvas, which shows only the first timid hints of naturalism, here the artist displays a significant maturing and reveals an absorbtion of Caravaggesque method. The background landscape has been eliminated and replaced with a deep shadow throughout, in accordance with the tenets of the new naturalistic style. The figures, all concentrated in the foreground, are set much closer to the picture plane, accentuating the emotional intereaction between themselves and the viewer.The beautiful dove held by Saint Anne is a master passage of impressionistic brushwork, economically rendered with extremely rapid brushstrokes that are full of color and light. Likewise the cradle to the lower right, realized with an astonishing speed and lucid realistic effect, can be considered as a harbinger of the painting of Vel�zquez. This passage is an important parallel to the famous ""basket"" executed by Borgianni in these same years"

24987-catholic.jpg	"Ferdinand and Isabel became known as the ""Catholic Kings"" because of their religious zeal, offering the Jews and Moors the choice of converting to Catholicism or being expelled from Spain. This paintings along with seven others formed parts of an altarpiece probably painted for a church or convent in Valladolid in north central Spain and commissioned by or for the monarchs. The high quality of the altarpiece and its probable royal patronage have given the painter the name Master of the Catholic Kings.The last incident of Jesus' childhood recorded in the Bible derives from Luke (2:41-52). Leaving Jerusalem after celebrating the Passover feast, Joseph and Mary discovered that Jesus was not in the caravan. Returning and searching for three days, they found the boy in scholarly dispute in the temple. Christ among the Doctors shows Joseph and Mary entering the synagogue at the right, while Jesus sits on a dais and thoughtfully places one forefinger on the other. The gesture, also used by the doctor in the foreground at the right, probably implies pointing out stages in a debate.Deep space is skillfully indicated by contrasting the large scale of the foreground figures with the distant view of a town glimpsed through the door behind Joseph and Mary. The stained-glass windows bear the heraldry of Ferdinard and Isabel as well as of Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire. The Spanish monarchs' daughter and son were married to the son and daughter respectively of the Holy Roman Emperor in 1496 and 1497. Thus the altarpiece may have commemorated these dynastic weddings"

42581-13view0.jpg	"Signature: Signed with monogram, below left on the boat.Provenance: This, the most famous painting by Vermeer, was part of the Amsterdam sale of 1696, no. 31: ""The town of Delft in perspective, to be seen from the south, by J. van der Meer of Delft; fl 200."" Sale S. J. Sinistra et al., Amsterdam; 1822, no. 112. For F 2,900 to de Vries. Purchased by the state of the Netherlands.Topographic views of cities had become a tradition by the time Vermeer painted his famous canvas. Hendrik Vroom was the author of two such works depicting Delft, but they are more archaic because they followed the traditional panoramic approach that we remember from the two cityscapes by Hercules Seghers at the Berlin museum. The latter artist was one of the first to make use of the inverted Galilean telescope to transcribe the preliminary prints and their proportions (more than twice as high as wide) into the more conventional format of his paintings.Vermeer executed his View of Delft on the spot, but the optical instrument pointed toward the city and providing the artist with the aspect translated onto canvas, which we admire for its conciseness and special structure, was not the camera obscura but the inverted telescope. It is only the latter that condenses the panoramic view of a given sector, diminishes the figures of the foreground to a smaller than normal magnification, emphasizes the foreground as we see it in the picture, and by the same token makes the remainder of the composition recede into space. The image thus obtained provides us with optical effects that, without being unique in Dutch seventeenth-century painting, as often claimed, convey a cityscape that is united in the composition and enveloped atmospherically into glowing light.We admire the town, but it is not a profile view of a township, but a painting, an idealized representation of Delft, with its main characteristics simplified and then cast into the framework of a harbour mirroring selected reflections in the water, and a rich, full sky with magnificent cloud formations looming over it. This is chronologically the last painting by Vermeer that was executed in rich, full pigmentation, with colour accents put in with a fully loaded brush. The artist outdid himself in a rendition of his hometown, which stands as a truly great interpretation of nature"

05067-cydippe.jpg	The picture shows a woman kneeling on a cushion, contemplating an apple she holds in her right hand. The scene is identified as an episode from Heroides by Ovid who wrote of the love of the prosperous but undistinguished Acontius for Cydippe, the daughter of a wealthy man. While Cydippe was offering a sacrifice in the temple, Acontius cast an apple at her feet, inscribed with the words: 'I vow at the shrine of Diana that I shall wed Acontius'. Cydippe read her suitor's message aloud and, having uttered the promise, was bound to become Acontius's wife. Paulus Bor is the only painter known to have illustrated this tale.

28929-tailor.jpg	The painting represents a tailor resting during his work.Like Moretto's earlier likenesses of Brescian noblemen sympathetic to the Holy Roman Emperor and Titian's portraits of the emperor and others, early aristocratic portraits by Moroni use the full-length, life-size format. By the 1570s, however, the fashion for portraiture had spread from nobles to the professional classes. Yet this sympathetic depiction of a tailor at his work remains unique. It has been plausibly suggested that Moroni executed the painting in exchange for services rendered - perhaps a suit in that fashionable Spanish black coat proffered by the tailor. The tailor wears a less stylish costume of red and buff, albeit with a Spanish ruff.The realism of the painting, dispassionately even-handed in its description of objects, details of costume, physiognomy and expression., should not blind us to its artful geometric structure. The three-quarter length format is justified by the table. Instead of creating the usual barrier between sitter and spectator, it forges a friendly link between them through the angle at which it is set, and because of the unaffected way it enables the tailor to pause before cutting his cloth in order to address the viewer

25194-descent2.jpg	The outstanding painter in Cologne at the turn of the century, this unknown artist is named after the Saint Bartholomew Altarpiece now in Munich, and is also the author of a much larger version of the Deposition, now in the Louvre. In both the Paris and the National Gallery pictures the scene appears to take place within a carved and gilded shrine, mimicking the sculpted German tabernacles of the fifteenth century with their Gothic tracery and painted statues.The theme is by these means set before our eyes in Cologne (or so it would have seemed to a contemporary viewer, kneeling before this picture in private devotion). The rocks and skull of the foreground, however, specify the historic location of the Crucifixion: Calvary or Golgotha ('place of a skull' in the languages of the Gospels). Like a medieval schoolmaster, the artist sets out to teach us the steps to Christian spirituality. Attracting us by pattern, gold and rich colour, he leads us on to sensory empathy, first of a pleasurable kind, with the rich textures of the worldly Magdalen's brocade and the gorgeous pearls and tassel of old Joseph, the 'rich man of Arimathea' (Matthew 27:57). Then he takes us beyond pleasure, to the hard wood of ladder and cross, to physical pain and mortal sorrow. Huge beads of blood spring from the open wounds of Christ, and oversize tears glisten on the cheeks of the other figures. Their eyes are red-rimmed from weeping. Christ's arms are locked in rigor mortis and his body is turning grey with death. As the vivid devotional manuals of the time taught, we must impress his message on pur hearts, reliving in meditation this most sorrowful moment of the Passion. Only then can we succeed in the mystics' goal of the Imitation of Christ and his saints.The figures are carefully differentiated: Nicodemus on the ladder lowers the body of Christ to Joseph of Arimathea, who has donated his own tomb for Christ's burial. Saint John supports the fainting Virgin. Mary Magdalene at the foot of the cross clutches her head, almost doubled up with grief. A young helper has hooked his leg around the cross piece, and the two other Maries stand in the back, the one praying, the other contemplating the crown of thorns as she comforts the Magdalen. Men and women, young and old, rich and poor, find their place before their crucified Saviour

38514-lancelot.jpg	The picture shows the simulated loggia architecture with landscape views in the Sala de' Palafrenieri in the Palazzo Lancellotti, Rome.For Baroque fresco decorations it was necessary to create 'quadratura' - perspective produced with the aid of a grid of squares - based on architectural principles. Most painters of quadratura, whether for stage sets or in the context of decorative painting, were either architects or specialists in the proper rendering of foreshortened architecture. They were accordingly ill-equipped for the depiction of figures, the very reason for the existence of ceiling pictures. Consequently, they were required to collaborate with figure painters (pittori figuristi), and there were any number of such collaborations in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: Tassi and Domenichino, Tassi and Guercino, Colonna and Albani, Haffner and Canuti, and Mengozzi Colonna and Tiepolo, to name only a few. Teams like these frequently worked together for years.Just as figure painters could make themselves independent of the quadraturista, there are instances in which the quadratura painter eschewed the collaboration of a figurista. One of these is provided by the versatile Agostino Tassi, who was not only a specialist in festival decorations, mock architecture, landscape prospects, and seascapes, but also functioned successfully on repeated occasions as his own figure painter. He created in Rome's Palazzo Lancellotti a work that set new standard, and not only in its monumental dimensions. In three years he and his workshop transformed the two-story Sala de' Palafrenieri on the piano nobile into a double loggia whose arcades open out onto expansive sea and landscape prospects. Colourful parrots and peacocks are perched on the upper-story balustrades

05007-dives.jpg	Like Paris Bordone, Bonifacio Veronese fails to convey the spiritual complexity of the world of the Mannerists, but used their formulae as a means of renewing and developing his innate gifts as a narrator. Thus he exploited the sensuous richness of the range of colours derived from Palma il Vecchio in his dynamic formal articulations and complex perspective-spacial proposals which were inspired in particular by prints of paintings by Raphael and the Roman artists. The most inspired poetic achievement of the fascinating decorative liberty attained by Bonifacio Veronese in the course of the fourth decade of the sixteenth century is without doubt this representation of 'Dives and Lazarus' which is mentioned in 1660 by Boschini as hanging in Palazzo Giustiniani at San Stae.The Gospel parable is here not used as a prompt for dramatic effects but rather for the discursive presentation of a civilized meeting in the discreet half-light of the portico of a country house of the time. The languorous abandon to the music displayed by the group in the foreground is not in the least disturbed by the presence of the beggar, Lazarus, nor yet by the sudden bursting in of the armed men taking refuge from the fire blazing in the distance on the right, while the left and centre of the picture depict the serene passing of time in country house life: the servants intent on their bread-making, the lovers at the entrance to the tree garden, the hunters resting against the wall of the building. In the light, mellowed by the melancholy, yearning reflections of sunset, the colours acquire a refined neo-Byzantine richness and seem to be reminiscent of the 'courtly' fables of Vittore Carpaccio

The event is no longer supernatural, and Mount Tabor is reduced to a slight rise. The afternoon is well advanced : at the left a farmer leads an ox and goat past a monastery on a crag that is already darkening in the evening shadows. Christ stands in the centre of this chilly landscape, his hands and head silhouetted against the shining white clouds. The flanking figures of Moses and Elijah have all the majesty of the Old Testament. Before this group the three apostles have fallen to the ground.

11026-505david.jpg	With the illness of 1820, David began to sense the end of his life and was determined to paint one last grand statement. In 1821 he began work on Mars Disarmed by Venus and the Three Graces. Completed in 1824, the work is bold, surprising and puzzling, and many people then and now have wondered exactly what he meant by this strange scene played out against an ornate marble pavilion in the sky.Mars, the god of war, is succumbing to the charms of Venus, but the outcome is still in doubt. Venus hesitates to place the crown of roses on his head - an emblem of submission to the pleasures of the flesh - and Cupid, who unties Mars' sandal, has put down his bow with the golden arrow of desire and the leaden arrow of repulsion side-by-side and not yet fired. Mars is shown nude and David delicately placed one of a pair of rather scruffy cooing doves to conceal his genitals for the sake of propriety. The pale Venus is an extremely delicate and sinuous form and much thinner than this voluptuous goddess is usually depicted. Behind the divine couple on the antique couch are the Three Graces who perform aimless tasks. One offers a cup of wine to Mars who has no free hand to take it, another rolls his shield as if it were a child's hoop and we can only wonder where the Grace on the left thinks she is putting Mars' helmet. Traditionally, the Graces were the beautifuI handmaidens of Venus, but these are patently 'graceless Graces' and their gestures and expressions border on the absurd and comical.The overall effect is certainly perplexing and unnerving and it is also painted in a highly coloured hard-edged style that perhaps suggests considerable contributions from his Belgian assistants

07487-17judit.jpg	A whole book in the Bible is devoted to Judith, because as a woman she embodies the power of the people of Israel to defeat the enemy, though superior in numbers, by means of cunning and courage. She seeks out Holofernes in his tent, makes him drunk, then beheads him. The sight of their commander's bloodstained head on the battlements of Bethulia puts the enemy to flight.In the painting, Judith comes in with her maid - surprisingly and menacingly - from the right, against the direction of reading the picture. The general is lying naked on a white sheet. Paradoxically, his bed is distinguished by a magnificent red curtain, whose colour crowns the act of murder as well as the heroine's triumph.The first instance in which Caravaggio would chose such a highly dramatic subject, the Judith is an expression of an allegorical-moral contest in which Virtue overcomes Evil. In contrast to the elegant and distant beauty of the vexed Judith, the ferocity of the scene is concentrated in the inhuman scream and the body spasm of the giant Holofernes. Caravaggio has managed to render, with exceptional efficacy, the most dreaded moment in a man's life: the passage from life to death. The upturned eyes of Holofernes indicate that he is not alive any more, yet signs of life still persist in the screaming mouth, the contracting body and the hand that still grips at the bed. The original bare breasts of Judith, which suggest that she has just left the bed, were later covered by the semi-transparent blouse.The roughness of the details and the realistic precision with which the horrific decapitation is rendered (correct down to the tiniest details of anatomy and physiology) has led to the hypothesis that the painting was inspired by two highly publicized contemporary Roman executions; that of Giordano Bruno and above all of Beatrice Cenci in 1599.

33609-14group.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 415.The painting, popularly called The Syndics, Rembrandt's largest portrait commission during his late years, is an ideal solution of the principal problem of painting a portrait group. Equal importance has been given to each of the five officials - their servant, wearing a skull cap, is in the centre yet the whole is united by ingenious psychological and formal means. The subtle composition, the glowing colouristic harmonies, and above all the sympathetic interpretation and profound psychological grasp of the personalities of the six men make this Rembrandt's greatest group portrait. The total impression is of delicately adjusted harmony and tranquillity.Rembrandt brilliantly exploits horizontals - a classical rather than a Baroque device - for the unification of the group. Three horizontals run through the picture at almost equal intervals: the edge of the table and the arm of the chair at the left mark the lowest one; the middle one is established by the prevailing level of the heads; and the upper one runs along the edge of the wainscoting. But here again Rembrandt avoids all formal rigidity. These repeated horizontals are broken by sharp deviations on all three levels. The sharpest is in the group itself, in the strong curve of the head on the left. With a kind of contrapuntal effect, this movement is echoed by the slight rise in the upper horizontal on that side.While this style of composition is similar to the relief-like manner of grouping favoured by artists who worked in the classical tradition, there is an increased effect of space and atmosphere by Rembrandt's use of chiaroscuro and colour. The harmonies are definitely on the warm side. A flaming red in the rug on the table, which is the most outstanding accent, is interwoven with golden tints. Golden browns reappear in the background, in the panels of the wall, and within these warmly coloured surroundings the strong blacks and whites in the men's costumes have a noble and harmonious effect.The traditional interpretation of the painting is that the men were shown seated on a platform, before the assembly of the Drapers' Guild and that they are giving to the assembly - unseen by the viewer - an account of the year's business. The official seated near the centre of the picture makes a gesture with his right hand which most seventeenth-century observers understood immediately; the gesture was a standard one employed by orators demonstrating evidence

21252-musical1.jpg	The theme of musical companies was one of the favourite subjects of van Kuijl's teacher Gerrit van Honthorst and his followers, notably among the circle of Caravaggesque painters based in Utrecht, who had seen this aspect of Caravaggio's style in Rome and imported it to the northern Netherlands in the first half of the seventeenth century. This seems to be the largest and grandest of Van Kuijl's several treatments of the subject. The earliest is the Musical Company of 1651 in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, in which some motifs such as the viol-da-gamba player anchoring one side of the composition and the young boy at the table are common to this painting too.

03638-virgin1.jpg	The two panels, depicting the Birth of the Virgin ad the Annunciation, form a pair and relate two episodes from the life of the Virgin. Stylistically they are heavily indebted to the Early Netherlandish painters, such as Jan van Eyck and the Master of Fl�malle. The artist has treated The Birth of the Virgin as a domestic scene, filling the room with details and everyday objects. Various women surround St Anne as they perform their tasks. This type of painting, which delights in decoration and wealth of detail, was developed at around this period in Antwerp by a group of little-known painters, among them de Beer. They are sometimes referred to as the Antwerp Mannerists

The other panels were probably partly completed by assistants, while the protagonists of the Annunciation are among the most fascinating images of Lotto's maturity. Lotto, who was very fond of the theme of the announcement that Mary was to give birth to the son of God, presented the episode in various ways. Here the evocation of the iridescent, almost incorporeal angel confers a dream-like fascination on the event, which is, however, placed on a plane of worldly normality by the Virgin's gesture and expression.The Virgin is on the upper right panel of the polyptych

14185-09letter.jpg	This picture exemplifies Fragonard's feeling for colour, his sensitive handling of effects of light, and his extraordinary technical facility. The elegant blue dress, lace cap, and coiffure of the woman seated at her writing table must have been the height of fashion at the time this painting was made. The inscription on the letter she holds has given rise to different interpretations. It may simply refer to her cavalier, but if it is read Cuvillere, then the sitter would be the daughter of Fran�ois Boucher, Fragonard's teacher.

35392-03erect4.jpg	Rubens painted the triptych for the high altar of Antwerp's church of St Walpurgis, which was demolished in 1817. That explains the inclusion of Amand, Walpurgis and Eligius on the back side of the wings. According to tradition, Bishop Amand founded that church - Antwerp's first - some time around 650. He features on the outside of the wings in the company of Walpurgis, a 8th-century saint, who supposedly lived for several years as a hermitess in the church's crypt, before becoming abbess of the convent she founded in Bavaria. In the right shutter, Rubens placed St Eligius, the blacksmith and bishop. Eligius was the patron saint of Antwerp's blacksmiths, who had their altar at St Walpurgis. Catherine of Alexandria stands in front of him with her martyr's sword and palm branch. The prominent position she is given in the altarpiece no doubt had something to do with a special devotion in the church, perhaps a confraternity of St Catherine, of which, however, no details are known

08806-heatande.jpg	Frederic Church was Thomas Cole's star pupil, and as Cole was the major figure in the first generation of the Hudson River School, so Church dominated the second. He did not confine himself to views of New York and New England; in the 1850s, influenced by the great explorer Alexander von Humboldt, he traveled to South America and made sketches that were the basis of a great Andean panorama. Church painted nature with uncanny fidelity and an abiding sense of awe. His landscapes embodied America's belief that the opening of frontiers and territorial expansion were the nation's destiny. When this monumental painting was first shown to the public in 1859, in a darkened room and illuminated by hidden lights, it caused a sensation.

21853-skaters.jpg	Landscapes and cityscapes were a very popular art form in the Netherlands during the nineteenth century. Many artists rejected the more classical French landscape, aiming instead for Dutch landscape with rivers and windmills and looked back to the 'Golden Age' of the seventeenth century for inspiration. Charles Leickert worked during this period and became known for his landscape and cityscape paintings. He painted the cluttered banks of the Amstel River, a picturesque embankment near a ferry to the city of Dordrecht, and ice scenes with Dutch windmills and skaters.Leickert's winter scenes were mostly done on the diagonal, with one or more windmills, to either the left or right.

08146-balbi1.jpg	The picture shows the ceiling painting with simulated portico in the Salone Principale on the third floor in the Palazzo Balbi Senarega, Genoa. The centre panel with the Four Ages of Man was executed by Valerio Castello, while the painted architecture is the work of Andrea Sighizzi (active 1630-1684) from Bologna.For Baroque fresco decorations it was necessary to create 'quadratura' - perspective produced with the aid of a grid of squares - based on architectural principles. Most painters of quadratura, whether for stage sets or in the context of decorative painting, were either architects or specialists in the proper rendering of foreshortened architecture. They were accordingly ill-equipped for the depiction of figures, the very reason for the existence of ceiling pictures. Consequently, they were required to collaborate with figure painters (pittori figuristi), and there were any number of such collaborations in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: Tassi and Domenichino, Tassi and Guercino, Colonna and Albani, Haffner and Canuti, and Mengozzi Colonna and Tiepolo, to name only a few. Teams like these frequently worked together for years.One advantage of the division of labour between the 'quadraturista' and the 'figurista' was that there was no urgent need for the two painters to work at the same time. The painting of the Salone Principale in the Palazzo Balbi Senarega, Genoa appears to be a case in point. Here the quadratura painter Andrea Sighizzi produced an imaginary portico with a centre opening which is overlapped by several of the figures of the tumultuous allegory painted by Valerio Castello showing the four ages of man subjected to the passage of time. This would indicate that the two parts of the commission were for the most part executed independently of each other

19061-atalanta.jpg	Hall� was a French history painter working in Paris. He was one of the painters from whom a cycle on the life of Saint Louis, destined for the chapel of the �cole Militaire, was commissioned in 1772.In the Boeotian version of the legend, followed by Ovid (Met. 10:560-707), Atalanta was an athletic huntress. Her way with her suitors was to challenge them to a race in which the loser was punished with death. She remained unbeaten and a virgin until Hippomenes (elsewhere named Melanion) took her on. As they ran he dropped three golden apples, given to him by Venus, and since Atalanta could not resist stopping to pick them up she lost the race.  They later made love in a temple of Cybele, which offended the goddess so much that she turned them both into lions. In the picture Atalanta is shown in the act of stooping to pick up an apple as Hippomenes overtakes her.

06728-1foscar1.jpg	The interior of the foresteria is divided into a large main room, flanked by other spaces, the guest rooms. Frescoes cover the entire wall surface of the main room, executed by Domenico Bruni and Pietro Liberi.The dimensions of the main room seem greatly expanded by the extraordinary theatrical effect of the illusionistic architecture, which creates the impression of a vast courtyard, open to the sky and surrounded on four sides by monumental loggias. The trompe l'oeil decoration is the work of Domenico Bruni, who signed and dated his undertaking in Latin letters placed on plaques that are painted and inserted into the frieze of the first stringcourse.Figural compositions are for the most part secondary to the architectural layout, and the only place figures appear, besides the ceiling, is along the two short walls where there are depictions of The Temple of the Arts and Mars Accompanied by Learning, Truth, and Eloquence. These paintings are attributed to Pietro Liberi

40108-entombme.jpg	Tournier was the only French painter to employ a dramatic force equal to that of Caravaggio. Most of his pictures are not in good condition and are often difficult to judge, but it is possible to see that he favoured simple pyramidal compositions with dramatic lighting which seem, surprisingly enough, to be inspired by Caravaggio's last compositions painted in Sicily, which Tournier can hardly have known in Rome. The Deposition from the Cross and the Entombment (both in the Mus�e des Augustins, Toulouse) lack the inhibitions and decorative preoccupations found in almost all other Caravaggesque painters, except those by Valentin. Tournier's stature can be judged by these two intense paintings alone.The painting was executed for the chapel of the P�nitents Noirs in Toulouse

40881-04deposi.jpg	The anonymous artist who executed this panel is referred to as the Master of the Legend of St Catherine. The panel is the center of a triptych showing the donor on the left wing and the Resurrection on the right wing. The painter has obviously thought hard about the technical aspects of taking Jesus down from the Cross, and (very unconventionally) has two men on ladders removing the body. All the figures derive from Rogier; the mourning woman on the right, for instance, is a version of a figure in the center of the Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (Antwerp).Rogier van der Weyden's last assistants probably included one of the leading painters of the later 15th century, Hans Memling. Memling was only one of many Netherlandish painters who took their guidelines mainly from Rogier in the last third of the 15th century, and were very ready to adopt his motifs. He was, however, the most artistically important of them, and handled Rogier's legacy more confidently than the rest. In Bruges and particularly in Brussels, where Rogier had lived and worked, other less outstanding artists followed his great example, often producing very outmoded paintings. The artist known as the Master of the Legend of St. Catherine, for instance, cites the Brussels town painter freely in his works, but with his rather clumsy compositions, and faces that are sometimes almost in the nature of caricature, he lags far behind Rogier. Since this anonymous master had an extraordinarily wide knowledge of Rogier's ideas, it has been suggested that he was Rogier's son, Pieter van der Weyden, but there is no further evidence for the identification

06734-chieric1.jpg	The Hall of the Firmament is a rectangular space distinguished by a soaring, barrel-vaulted ceiling, where a unified composition unfolds to spectacular effect. The sky is divided into stucco boxes by Bartolomeo Ridolfi (d. before 1572), a sculptor and stuccoist from Verona. Inscribed within some of the compartments are signs of the zodiac, other, smaller compartments contain monochrome allegories, based on antique cameos and Roman coins. Some seventy-seven different representations are contained within the firmament, which represent all the constellations of the northern and southern hemispheres known at that time. The constellations are organized into three bands: the first and third are composed of half-octagons; the second of octagons. In the long rectangle at the centre, the chariots of Apollo and Diana (the Sun and Moon) are depicted.In this fresco Brusasorci is clearly indebted, both in style and composition, to Giulio Romano, who illustrated the same subject in the Camera del Sole in the Palazzo del T�, Mantua

02840-winter_s.jpg	Avercamp spent most of his life in the small quiet town of Kampen on the eastern shore of the Zuider Zee. Residence relatively far from the principal artistic centres of the Netherlands helps to explain why this delightful artist, who discovered the pictorial qualities of flat landscapes and was the first to specialize in winter scenes of outdoor sport and leisure, had little influence on the development of Dutch landscape painting.Avercamp's pictures peopled with motley crowds of all ages and classes skating, sledging, golfing, and fishing on the frozen canals of Holland fascinate social historians as well as art historians. The latter sometimes find him a troublesome painter, because it is difficult to trace his development. The plain fact seems to be that he did not have a marked one. From the very beginning he could paint a landscape with a high horizon, a great accumulation of detail, and a number of light colours, or one with a low horizon, few details, and vivid colours in the foreground which lighten as they recede to the distance. The two possibilities existed simultaneously and could be used at will until the end of his career, depending on either the artist's, or his patron's predilections

40310-201turne.jpg	While the Suffolk-born Constable wished to become a natural painter, Turner, son of a modest barber in Covent Garden, yearned for sublimity. Trained as a topographical draughtsman, he achieved his ambition through mastering the idioms of Claude and of the grander Dutch seventeenth-century marine and landscape painters as well as the melodramatic effects of the scene designer Jacques Philippe de Loutherbourg. Now nearly forgotten, this Alsatian-born member of the French Academy delighted the London public, and influenced artists from Gainsborough to Turner and Joseph Wright of Derby, by staging panoramic peepshows in which painted landscapes, theatrical lighting and sound were combined to simulate natural phenomena and tragic catastrophes.In search of the Sublime, Turner travelled widely, sketching grandiose scenery and extreme weather conditions, which he translated into canvases exhibited with poetic quotations. He considered Dido building Carthage, or the Rise of the Carthaginian Empire (1815) his masterpiece, bequeathing it together with the Sun rising through Vapour to the National Gallery on condition that they be hung beside Claude's Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba and Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah. (This bequest is now honoured.)Turner's emulation of Baroque painting, however, did not exclude modern references, rather transmuting them into 'high' art. In this way he competed with both historic and contemporary masters. The 'Fighting Temeraire' was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839 with a quotation from Thomas Campbell's poem Ye Manners of England: The flag which braved the battle and the breeze/No longer owns her'. The Temeraire had distinguished herself at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, but by the 1830s the veteran warships of the Napoleonic wars were being replaced by steamships. Turner, on an excursion on the Thames, encountered the old ship, sold out of the service, being towed from Sheerness to Rotherhithe to be scrapped. In his painting topography and shipbuilding alike are manipulated to symbolic and pictorial ends. Turner conceives the scene as a modern Claude: a ghostly Temeraire and the squat black tug, belching fire and soot, against a lurid sunset. His technique is very different from Claude's, as thick impastoed rays and reflections contrast with thinly painted areas, and colours swoop abruptly from light to dark. A heroic and graceful age is passing, a petty age of steam and money bustles to hasten its demise. The dying sun signals the end of the one, a pale reflecting moon the rise of the other. But just as Claude's sunrises and sunsets enlist the viewer's own sense of journey, so does the last berth of the 'Fighting Temeraire' recall the breaking up of every human life

15188-judit0.jpg	As with much of Artemisia Gentileschi's work, scholars have tried to explain the hair-raising Judith Beheading Holofernes as a personal reaction to her 'date-rape' trial of 1612, but, in truth, her point of departure was far more visual than psychological. Her primary source was undoubtedly Caravaggio's Judith (Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome) from some ten years earlier. The intense violence of the slaying, the lack of decorative details and even Judith's stiff parallel arms are all reliant on Caravaggio. Artemisia probably also knew Adam Elsheimer's Judith Beheading Holofernes (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), which was owned by Rubens. Elsheimer's small copper may have influenced the position of Holofernes' body and legs, although it should be noted that Artemisia's canvas has been cut down on the left and his legs are now missing. Other expressive and compositional elements can be related to the work of her father Orazio, especially his Judith and Her Maidservant (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford). The youthful appearance and important co-conspiratorial role given to the maidservant Abra as well as the triangular structure are derived from Orazio's Hartford canvas.Artemisia's Judith has such close affinities with her father's work that a number of scholars have argued for Orazio's authorship. It has been suggested that Artemisia's Judith Beheading Holofernes (Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence) was essentially a fancy-dress copy of her father's earlier work and not an independent rethinking of the Naples composition. X-radiographs of the Naples picture reveal a substantial number of changes, which make it highly unlikely that the picture was a repetition of another composition. Furthermore, the quality of the execution is not high enough to be that of Orazio; nor did Orazio ever seek this level of brutal directness. The simplification of the drapery and lack of decorative embellishment are consistent with other pictures painted during Artemisia's first Roman period. A number of copies show the composition before it was cut down. A small one on touchstone (Quadreria Arcivescovile, Milan) is paired with a version of Orazio's David Contemplating the Head of Goliath (Galleria Spada, Rome). This may imply that both originals were in the same collection and that both were by Orazio, but it could also mean that the patron wanted a 'diptych' by father and daughter.

23868-4manet06.jpg	"The style known now as bock was a dark, malty, lightly hopped ale first brewed in the 14th century by German brewers in the Hanseatic town of Einbeck. The style from Einbeck was later adopted by Munich brewers in the 17th century and adapted to the new lager style of brewing. Due to their Bavarian accent, citizens of Munich pronounced ""Einbeck"" as ""ein Bock"" (""a billy goat""), and thus the beer became known as ""bock"".Bock is historically associated with special occasions, often religious festivals such as Christmas, Easter or Lent. Bocks have a long history of being brewed and consumed by Bavarian monks as a source of nutrition during times of fasting.This painting belongs to Manet's many caf� scenes such as The Plum Brandy, the Corner of a Caf�-Concert, and the Bar in the Folies-Berg�re"

21288-laban.jpg	The biblical story represented in this painting is the following.Jacob, the son of Isaac and the twin brother of Esau, fled from his brother's wrath, taking refuge with his uncle Laban in Mesopotamia. Laban had two daughters, Leah and Rachel. Leah the elder, was rheumy eyed, but Rachel was graceful and beautiful. Jacob undertook to serve Laban as a herdsman for seven years in return for Rachel whom he wished to marry. At the wedding feast Laban substituted Leah by a trick, and then demanded another seven years labour from Jacob before he should obtain Rachel.At the end Jacob set off secretly to return to Canaan with both wives and his children and possessions. In parting, Rachel stole her father's teraphim, the small sacred figurines which were his 'household gods'. When he discovered the theft Laban set off in pursuit, overtook the party and searched their tents and belongings. Rachel promptly hid the teraphim in a camel's saddle and sat on it, saying to her father, 'do not take it amiss, sir, that I cannot rise in your presence, the common lot of women is upon me.'

03465-1william.jpg	"In this painting an imaginary Gothic church interior is the setting for the tomb monument of William the Silent (1533-1584). Seen from the choir, whose stalls occupy the left foreground, the monument has been placed in the crossing, partially obscuring the view into the nave, To the right of the tomb the transept open into a side aisle or a chapel. The plain white walls and the absence of any religious imagery suggest that the church is a Protestant one. The man dressed in fine red attire in the foreground faces away from the viewer and toward the tomb, thereby drawing us into the scene, while other expensively dressed people casually walk about and chat. The figures have been attributed to Esaias van de Velde (1587-1630), with whom Van Bassen frequently collaborated.The rendering of the interior - the central perspective, deeply receding space, and detailed description of the architectural details - is reminiscent of the Antwerp tradition of architectural painting as represented by Hans Vredeman de Vries, Hendrick van Steenwyck, and Pieter Neeffs the Elder. Their rigidly constructed interiors often appear to be airless boxes, However. While retaining the single-point perspective favoured by his Flemish colleagues, Van Bassen introduces light and atmospheric effects as means to articulate architectural space. Thus, the shadowed area in the foreground serves as a repoussoir to set off the crossing and the tomb, which is bathed in sunlight streaming in from the left transept. The right transept, with its northern light, is more softly lit, in contrast tot the brightly lit chapel or aisle beyond it. In the nave soft yet relatively radiant light counteracts the deep recession of the space. It has been often observed that Van Bassen's interiors appear more realistic than those of his Flemish predecessors. This is mainly a result of his realization that light and atmosphere are as important as perspectival systems for producing a convincing illusion of a three-dimensional space. The following generation of Delft architectural painters, such as Van Bassen's pupil Gerard Houckgeest as well as Hendrick van Vliet and Emmanuel de Witte, developed this approach more fully after 1650.The actual setting of the tomb of William the Silent is in the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft, where the monument stands in the choir and the seated effigy of the prince faces the nave. In the present painting Van Bassen has turned the tomb 180 degrees and enlarged it in relation to the church interior, thus making it a more awe-inspiring presence. The tomb has been commissioned by the States General in commemoration of the ""Father of the Fatherland"", William the Silent, who had been assassinated at his residence, the Prinsenhof, in Delft, in 1584. Work on the mausoleum began in 1614, after designs by the Amsterdam architect Hendrick de Keyser (1565-1621). The tomb was finished only in 1623, by Hendrick's son Pieter (1595-1676), three years after the date of Van Bassen's painting. The picture is the earliest painted rendering of the monument. Since the figures on the top of the monument were never ""in situ"", Van Bassen probably worked from designs or a model"

39149-13zianig.jpg	This fresco comes from the Tiepolo family house (villa) at Zianigo, between Padua and Venice. Gian Domenico's fresco cycle has been detached and is now preserved in the Ca' Rezzonico. This scene decorated the portego or gallery-salon of the family villa.Here Gian Domenico reverts to the treatment of composition which his father brought to a similar scene in the Villa Valmarana near Monteberico (dated to 1737 or 1757). But here he amplifies the original conception into a wider view in keeping with his own enlarged horizon, shifting things on to a new plane of visual perspective. Broad expanses of hazy brown set off the vivid figures from the cold hues of the surroundings. Gian Domenico moves these images into close contact with their setting, lodging them, like other 'paternal archetypes' of his, in an empirical space.The scenes from life represented appear under a new and novel aspect of landscape and environment.The elegant lady promenading on the arms of her husband and beau is also accompanied by her favourite lap dog held by a man servant. It is the artist's clear intention to achieve verisimilitude in the portrayal of people and things

43733-pastoral.jpg	Although once attributed to Breenbergh, this tondo is certainly the work of Goffredo Wals. A native of Cologne, Wals came to Rome via Naples. Once in the Eternal City, he seems to have immediately come into contact with Agostino Tassi; he is recorded in Tassi's workshop by 1616. Some landscapes by the two artists are very similar, especially the rounded hills, silhouetted against each other, whose profiles are interrupted by only the scantiest vegetation. Whether Wals influenced Tassi or was instead indebted to him cannot be precisely assessed, since we know almost nothing about their relative chronologies.According to the seventeenth-century writer Raffaello Soprani, Wals invented a kind of landscape structured on three planes, exactly like the one in this Pastoral Landscape. His interest in Adam Elsheimer's way of composing a landscape is, however, clear. While the Bolognese painters were concerned about a gradual recession into depth, Elsheimer, and later Wals and Tassi, liked to juxtapose a few planes. Wals worked only on a small scale, often using the circular format typical of mirrors, probably because he intended his art to be a reflection of nature. At least this is how Soprani interpreted it. Only rarely did Wals's pictures include a subject or even classical buildings. His shepherds here are probably contemporary ones, not inhabitants of a remote Arcadia. Like Filippo Napoletano, he is interested in the simple solid volumes of unassuming dwellings, on whose surfaces light and shade are strongly contrasted

09660-12barber.jpg	The Palazzo Barberini, residence of the papal family Barberini, set a new standard for Roman palace architecture and its painted decoration. Planning for the expansion of the sixteenth-century structure was first undertaken by Carlo Maderno, then transferred after his death to Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who here distinguished himself as an architect for the first time.The first commission for the painted decor was given to Andrea Sacchi who in 1629-30 painted the ceiling of the largest room in the wing occupied by Anna Colonna, Taddeo Barberini's wife. Sacchi painted here the fresco identified as Triumph of Divina Sapientia (divine wisdom). Then in 1631 Pietro da Cortona's coworkers, Giovanni Francesco Romanelli, Giacinto Gimignani, and Pietro Paolo Baldini painted the adjacent chapel, which was consecrated to the crucified Christ (Cappella del Crocifisso). That patronage explains the chapel's christological program and Pietro da Cortona's altar fresco of the Crucifixion

41928-soignes.jpg	A number of Brussels artists developed an individual landscape style with which to convey the characteristic appearance of the heavily forested area around their city - the 'Soignes forest painters' produced large and elegant wooded landscapes using an oil painting technique recalling that of Rubens. The human figures in their paintings are customarily shown as tiny compared to the luxuriant nature that fills the compositions with large, dark bodies of trees. The leading Brussels landscape artists were Lodewijk de Vadder (1605-1655), Jacques d'Artois (1603-1686) and Lucas Achtschellinck (1626-1699). Their landscapes have something of the character of tapestries and probably had a corresponding decorative function

34302-maruce02.jpg	The largest room on the ground floor is the Sala d'Ercole, a hall with two window bays. It has three entrances and presents an elaborate painted decoration extending across all four walls and the entire ceiling. The decoration was executed with the collaboration of Giuseppe Tonelli (1668-1732), one of the best known quadratura painters in Florence. The pictorial program contains the Labours and Apotheosis of Hercules.A simple, rhythmic arrangement of columns, backed by a gilt ground, structures all four walls in the room. On three sides it is interrupted by a large, arched centre opening. The compositions for these imaginary openings are three of Hercules's more significant labours. Prominent on the end wall is the depiction of the young Hercules at the Crossroads between Vice and Virtue, the other two openings contains Hercules and Cacus, and Hercules and Nessus. On the window wall a painted sculpture depicting Hercules and Antheus can be found.In the Sala d'Ercole Ricci's fluid, elegant, and atmospheric style attains a brilliance and airiness that set him apart from all his famous contemporaries, and has been shown to anticipate features of Rococo painting

15444-2ogniss1.jpg	"""His first paintings were in the Chapel of the Vespucci at Ognissanti, representing a dead Christ and some saints, and a Misericordia over an arch, containing a portrait of Amerigo Vespucci, who navigated the Indies..."" (Vasari).The date of the chapel's construction is 1472. We can date the frescoes immediately afterward. In these Ognissanti frescoes the inspiration of Baldovinetti is marginal; more obvious are certain elements acquired from Andrea del Castagno and some clear, vivid colours that are reminiscent of Domenico Veneziano. Most interesting, however, is the artistic personality of Ghirlandaio himself, so well defined at this early age, and that attentive observation of man in every physical and interior detail that made him such an able portraitist.Here is the old man, probably the head of the family, seen from behind, kneeling, solidly built, his lean face with its hard features softened by the whiteness of his fine hair. The older woman in a cloak stands out in a contrast of lights and colours. Serenely clear, on the other hand, is the younger woman, with her hair gathered into plaits and her ample forehead shaved back according to the Florentine fashion of the time. The expression on the face of the boy, thought to be Amerigo Vespucci, is intense; his face, with its full lips and large clear eyes, is still chubby, pinkish and childlike. Domenico's attention seems to have lingered on the figures, perhaps in prayer, right there in Ognissanti, his brush faithfully reproducing and individualizing the features of each of them"

36069-2visita2.jpg	This is a quintessential work of second generation Mannerism. It effectively demonstrates the key role that Salviati played in the evolution of the style in Rome. The oratory was decorated at various times by many other artists who were important in the second quarter of the sixteenth century. Salviati's painting can be viewed as a vast repertory of motifs not only in regard to the architectural backgrounds but (and above all) for the poses of the individual figures. He glacially interprets subjects and characters taken from classical antiquity. He also used judicious quotations from Raphael, especially his later works such as the Stanza dell'Incendio at Borgo. Salviati's draughtsmanship was impeccably perfect. He could conjure up new spaces merely by painting two characters entering a scene. Overall, however, the greatest impression he leaves is that of intellectual control over image and result. There is a strong overall sense of unreality connected particularly to the coldness of his colours

39787-12charle.jpg	This portrait is the earliest surviving example of a series of portraits Titian painted of Emperor Charles V. It was almost certainly painted in Bologna in 1533, for numerous sources describe the emperor's clothing at this time as being very similar to what he is shown wearing in the painting. It is generally accepted that in this picture Titian was copying a portrait made by the Austrian artist Jakob Seisenegger, though there have also been suggestions that the opposite is the case. Titian projects his subject's masterful personality more convincingly, however, by focusing on the Emperor's height, choosing a lower viewpoint and restricting ambient space

13003-couple.jpg	After the years studying in Rubens's workshop and a sojourn in Italy, Van Dyck settled in his native city of Antwerp and soon became one of the most popular portraitists of the wealthy bourgeoisie. For the most part he painted full-length official likenesses, or else family portraits with the sitters posed in setting of homely intimacy. He devised many different arrangements and poses, suiting them to the character and rank of the sitter, but the effect was always serious, noble and distinguised, and the impression of solemnity and reserve was enhanced by the dark costumes - high-necked black garments with starched ruffs - as in the portrait of the couple in Budapest.In this picture attention is focused on the sharply characterized faces and expressive, delicately depicted hands, while the black and white of the clothes, the red of the armchair, and the gold of the gloves provide a marvellously harmonious background. We do not know the identity of the married couple, unfortunately, and to discover their connection with any particular Antwerp family seems hardly possible today

21493-andrea2.jpg	The painting in the cupola vault represents the Heaven of All Saints with Assumption.With obvious borrowings from Correggio's cupola painting in Parma, Lanfranco produced in Sant'Andrea della Valle, for the fist time in Rome, an illusionistic composition consisting solely of foreshortened figures, presenting a fictive opening into heaven above the crossing. A mass of innumerable figures is grouped in two concentric circles around the bright lantern, where Christ reaches down toward the Virgin, who lifts her arm to him in turn, borne upward on a bank of clouds by countless angels.Lanfranco's cupola became a successful prototype for Roman Baroque, one that inspired an extraordinary numbers of imitations

42410-taking.jpg	Like his father, Willem van de Velde the Younger specialised in paintings of ships and naval battles, but whereas his father elected for the extreme precision of a draughtsmanlike technique, he preferred colour and a method that allowed him to depict the mood of the day, the lead-grey smoke of battle or clouds against a blue sky in stormy weather. His work displays great variety within the limitations of the genre, ranging from small, subtly executed pieces, like this one, to a monumental of Ij Sound in Amsterdam, now in the Amsterdams Historisch Museum, and from a single ship on mirror smooth water to dramatic fires at sea and raging storms.The Four Days Battle was a naval battle of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Fought from 11 June to 14 June 1666 off the Flemish and English coast, it remains one of the longest naval engagements in history. Although the Dutch claimed victory, both sides had suffered sever losses. Those of the English were greater and included the ships captured by the Dutch which are depicted in the companion piece (also in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam)

13461-self_pt.jpg	Carel Fabritius was Rembrandt's most outstanding pupil: he was a brilliant and experimental artist whose prodigious reputation rests on a handful of surviving paintings. Born in the village of Midden-Beemster and trained by his father, an amateur artist, Fabritius was in Rembrandt's Amsterdam studio in the years around 1640. His earliest known painting, The Raising of Lazarus reveals Fabritius's careful study of his master's The Night Watch, completed in 1642.This proto-romantic self-portrait, in which the artist shows himself with long, tousled hair, opennecked shirt and working smock against a background of crumbling plasterwork, probably dates from shortly after The Raising of Lazarus. There was perhaps a sense in which the choice of this dress had a special significance for Fabritius. The Latin word faber, from which Carel's father had taken the cognomen Fabritius, means workman, and the painter's pose and dress in this portrait may have been intended as an allusion to his name. Compositionally, the most striking feature is the daring placing of the head so far down on the panel, giving a greater than usual emphasis to the part of the picture that is occupied by the peeling plaster wall, and allowing Fabritius to explore effects of texture and shadow. It is a measure of Carel's extraordinary imaginative gifts that he could dispense in this way with the conventional centrality of the sitter's head in a bust portrait.Fabritius was to move to Delft in 1650 but died four years later in the explosion of the municipal powder magazine in the town, a premature end to a remarkable career

08001-magnani3.jpg	Admiration for the great Venetian painting of Titian, Tintoretto and, above all, Paolo Veronese, which as of the late 1580s characterized all three Carracci, can be gleaned in a collective undertaking, the frieze with the Stories of the Founding of Rome adorning the hall of honour in the palazzo of Lorenzo Magnani, elected senator in 1590. While Agostino reflects the brilliant palette of Veronese on an exterior level, Annibale taps into an epic tone in which nature and history are inextricably fused, and Lodovico forces the expressive potential of storytelling, vaunting a vivid imagination in terms of both composition and colour.

41465-mad_chil.jpg	The four saints around the throne are Sts Anthony, Peter, John the Baptist, and Matthew.This fine, though unfortunately fragmentary triptych, now bears the conventional name, only recently assigned to it, of the Master of Borgo alla Collina. Bernard Berenson considered it to be a work by the so-called Master of the Bambino Vispo. The latter was a figure of greater artistic significance, with whom the painter of this panel, an anonymous artist who may have been of Spanish origin, has often been confused owing to a similarity in the morphological details of their figures. In the past, the names of Pietro di Domenico da Montepulciano and Gherardo Starnina have also been put forward, the latter being a representative of International Gothic art, who might possibly have been the same person as the aforementioned Master of the Bambino Vispo.The Master of Borgo alla Collina is the name given to the painter of a triptych depicting the Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine among Saint Francis, the Angel and Tobias, Saint Michael Archangel, and Saint Louis of Toulouse, in the parish church of the village of that name in Casentino. The painting, which resembles the above, was purchased for 7,500 scudi by Filippo Andrea V Doria Pamphilj Landi in 1854 from the Roman painter Luigi Cochetti (who thought it to be the work of Taddeo di Bartolo), along with four more pictures

He painted most of the European princes who visited Rome, as well as three popes, but he was above all in demand with the European aristocracy, particularly the British travelling to Italy as part of the Grand Tour, owing to his creation of a new type of portrait in which he depicted the sitter against an antique, classical background

17904-2resting.jpg	This large panel is one of the new type of landscapes that Van Goyen created between 1628 and 1630. Unlike his early landscapes of around 1625 with their many anecdotal details and varying compositions, these later landscapes are characterized by  a unifying diagonal composition and a tonal unity consisting of a limited range of colours - ochre, green, grey and brown. In the present panel the main motifs are grouped along a diagonal leading from the right foreground to the horizon on the left

02513-8pair2.jpg	In correspondence to the Four Seasons was the series created three years later in 1566, the Four Elements. Through a paired arrangement of the qualities in the objects, warm-cold and damp-dry, the elements correspond to the seasons. Thus, the warm-dry summer corresponds to fire, the cold-damp winter to water, the warm-moist spring to air and the cold-dry autumn to earth. Thereby, through the arrangement of the heads, turned to the left or to the right, corresponding pairs face each other and form a unit. So, if desired, they could be arranged into a pair-grouping in which each head in one series would face its corresponding head in the other, as follows: Spring - Air, Summer - Fire, Autumn - Earth, Winter - Water.This picture shows the pairs Earth (Private collection)- Autumn (Denver) as well as Winter (Vienna)- Water (Vienna)

39586-1assunt11.jpg	"Titian worked on this huge altarpiece for more than two years from 1516 to 1518. It has to be seen as a milestone in Titian's career establishing him as a more universal artist who drew inspiration from outside the confines of Venice. Indeed the powerful figures of the Apostles reflect the influence of Michelangelo, whereas the painting demonstrates clear iconographical similarities with the works of Raphael. Above all, what emerges most strongly in the assumption is Titian's desire to break definitely with the traditions of Venetian painting in order to arrive at a synthesis of dramatic force and dynamic tension which will become from this moment on the most obvious characteristic of his work.The picture is composed of three orders. At the bottom are the Apostles (humanity), amazed and stunned by the wondreous happening. St Peter is kneeling with his hand on his breast, St Thomas is pointing at the Virgin, and St Andrew in a red cloak is stretching forward. In the middle, the madonna, slight and bathed in light, is surrounded by by a host of angels that accompany her joyfully hailing. Above is the Eternal Father, serene and noble majesty, calling the Virgin to him with a look of love.The painting is signed as ""Ticianus"" low down in the middle of the picture"

15494-1renunc.jpg	The St Francis cycle in the Sassetti Chapel starts in the tympanum on the left wall with the Renunciation of Worldly Goods, the scene in which the saint leaves his father and renounces his inheritance. It is perhaps surprising that this should be chosen as the theme for the mortuary chapel of a rich banker, but there were other bankers who considered the theme of poverty in response to God's call suitable for their funeral monuments - an example is Giotto's St Francis cycle in the Bardi Chapel, which was also commissioned by a banker.The young St Francis renounced the world by laying aside his expensive clothes and placing himself naked into the care of the Church. A churchman is taking him into protection under his cloak - the same gesture used by a Madonna of Mercy. Spectators are refraining the horrified father carrying his son's clothes across his arm.It should be noted that the stories, which are higher up and further from view, were probably left to his assistants: the Renunciation of Worldly Goods, the Test of Fire before the Sultan and the Stigmata. But even here the master's hand and eye return: in a facial expression, in the delicacy of certain effects of light, in a distant landscape, or in some ecstatic abandonment

06432-05februa.jpg	This is the second panel in the series of the Months painted by Bruegel for Niclaes Jonghelinck. This painting alludes to February which is shown as a dark, stormy month during which the peasants gather wood for their fires.The paper crown on the boy's head refers to Epiphany, the Festival of the Three Magi; waffles were commonly consumed at carnival time prior to Lent. Following the custom at this season, willow branches are being cut for the construction of walls and fences. The mountains in the background demonstrate the threatening proximity of cold and snow; a further source of threat can be seen in the storm whipping up the waves and causing ships to sink. The Netherlanders were a seafaring people; they knew how dangerous the winter months are at sea. Water, mountains and the near intimacy of the foreground are held together by the picture's particular coloration. The towering trees in the middle serve to anchor the agitated landscape

37274-1s_louis.jpg	"The altarpiece was painted for the Angevin, Robert the Wise, King of Sicily. It represents St Louis of Toulouse seated with his brother, Robert the Wise, kneeling before him. The altar is important for its format. It consists of a large upper panel containing the image of the saint; and a predella beneath containing five small scenes showing episodes taken from his life. This is the first altarpiece to survive intact with an historiated predella. (It was certainly not the first to exist.) Simone's altar marks the beginning of a process whereby this format gradually became the normal one.The St Louis altar, being a family monument, is also a good example of court art. The comparatively new demands for facial characterization, up to now associated mainly with sculpture, are here extended to painting in the kneeling figure of Robert the Wise. There is a considerable emphasis on costume, Robert kneeling in what are presumably his coronation robes. Both these and St Louis's cope are liberally covered with family heraldry. This extends to the frame, for the border of the whole panel is carved with ""fleur-de-lis"". Finally, the whole work was given an added sparkle and glitter by the addition of goldsmith's work to parts of St Louis figure; and also by the addition of stones (probably semi-precious) to such objects as the crowns. These are now lost but such additions were regularly made to royal tomb effigies in the north.In the predella, set in an arcade, there are five small pictures with scenes from the saint's life. They show: 1. his acceptance of the episcopal office, on condition that he would at the same time be permitted to enter the Franciscan order; 2. his entry into the Franciscan order and consecration as bishop; 3. washing the hands of the poor and inviting them to his table; 4. Louis on his bier; 5. the miracle of the boy raised from the dead"

07650-sacr_con.jpg	"The complex and unusual iconography of the ""Sewing Madonna"" includes the maternal symbolism conveyed by the quail and the rose tree behind the Virgin. Cariani used the same symbols in his Saint Gottard altarpiece to allude to the divine motherhood of the Madonna and to her virginity. The iconography of the National Gallery picture also includes symbols of fertility such as the rabbit and the cedar tree behind St Elizabeth, references to human motherhood. The most peculiar characteristic of the painting is, however, the human, everyday atmosphere of the scene: this quality is what places the painting in direct rapport with the style of the contemporary Lombard school. Also evident is the influence of Palma il Vecchio in the background landscape, which is distinctly separate from the scene in the foreground.Art historians have assigned the painting to Cariani's second Venetian period, between 1524 and 1530"

This included, in 1689, the building of an exterior flight of stairs leading up to the first floor. For this purpose the entrance to the chapel had to be moved. During the process, two sections of wall were cut out of the south western corner, in the Procession of the Oldest King. After the stairs were finished, the cut out elements were mounted on a corner of the wall projecting into the room.

29504-plague_x.jpg	Pietro Negri was a Venetian painter, the pupil of Antonio Zanchi.This is a detail of a huge painting which was begun by Antonio Zanchi and finished by Pietro Negri. The painting remembers the terrible plague of 1630 in Venice. The miraculous apparition of the Virgin, through St Mark's intercession, takes place against the steaming background of Venice where the Basilica della Salute can be seen. The Basilica, begun in 1631 as votive thanks for the end of the plague, was only completed in 1687 but by 1673 the most fundamental parts had been finished

39492-09soranz.jpg	Gravity, dignity, and integrity radiate from this portrait, which is very restrained in both colour and setting. Old Soranzo's white hair matches the fur trimming of his robe of office in both tone and artistic technique: marks of age and the insignia of power are closely connected in the gerontocracy of the Venetians. As the dominating element in the composition, the taut fur trimming continues the line of the strong-willed furrow between the brows. This feature makes the impressively upright bearing of the old procurator visible to the viewer even from some distance away

26326-harbour.jpg	The group called The Ten American Painters was founded in 1898. To contemporaries, the group was quickly seen as the core of American Impressionism. It was created by Childe Hassam, John Twachtman and Julian Weir. The group included Willard Metcalf, Edmund Tarbell, Frank Benson, Joseph De Camp, Thomas Dewing, Edward Simmons and Robert Reid. William Chase joined the group in 1902 after the death of Twachtman. The interest of the group was in the annual public exhibition of work that shared an aesthetic thrust. The Ten survived for almost twenty years till it was dissolved in 1917.Willard Metcalf belonged to the Boston School. Of the Boston painters he was the only one who had also been one of the Givernists who painted in proximity to Monet in 1877. His own work did not turn to Impressionism till the mid-1890s, though, and his fame dated from his membership of The Ten. Metcalf's was an art that celebrated the New England landscape and architecture, familiar from trips he undertook from his New York home. The radiant colours of Gloucester Harbour, painted in 1895 and one of his best known painting, show the influence of Impressionism on his art at that date. In style and subject matter, Metcalf was often palpably close to other American artists such as Robinson and particularly Hassam

31943-05visdom.jpg	Pontormo executed this celebrated painting for the chapel of Francesco di Giovanni Pucci in the church San Michele Visdomini in Florence. The painting, usually mentioned as the Pucci Altarpiece, portrays the Virgin with St John the Evangelist, Joseph, holding the baby Jesus, the young St John, St Francis and St James, the latter being the artist's self-portrait. This work shows clear references to classical figurative culture, although overall there is a definite break with the effects of harmony and equilibrium.The figures are arranged in two areas, divided by a vertical axis, which forms the height of a triangle, at whose apex is the Virgin's head. The painting, which also shows evident references to the psychological characterization and sfumato of Leonardesque works, nonetheless represents a moment of exasperation and overall saturation of classical motifs.The compositions of both the right part and the left part, although symmetrical and populated by an identical number of figures, are organized very differently. The complex twisting of the bodies and the many different directions of the gestures suggest the use of a grid of extremely complicated and dynamic geometrical schemes. The lines of vision go in all possible directions; in no instance do they cross or match, this emphasizing the psychological isolation of the figures. The facial features and expressions of the older Joseph and St John the Evangelist, as well as the laughing putti, are exaggeratedly pronounced. In short, everything combines to create an atmosphere of restless instability. The effect of suffocating compression produced by the reduction of spatial depth, and by the dense chiaroscuro that attenuates the colours, is counterbalanced by a centrifugal energy generated by the agitation of the figures. This definitely breaks the harmonious unity of the classical compositional structure

03965-bello105.jpg	The painting is part of a cycle of four canvases which are similar in shape and subject matter. The young Bellotto painted them during a seminal visit to Rome. Gradually, he was to move away from the faithful view of glimpses of Roman monuments. Instead he favoured the freer capriccio or imaginary view. This still included real buildings (which were truthfully reproduced) but they were set in an eclectic combination of invented architecture which in turn was given an evocative setting. Such capricci were very popular at the time.

07238-canal607.jpg	In the early 1740s Canaletto painted a series of 13 canvases which were described in early inventories as 'overdoors', in other words pictures intended to be set above doorways as part of a decorative scheme. They placed a particular emphasis on the works of the architect Palladio. Joseph Smith, for whom they may have been made, is known to have particularly favoured Palladian themes.This austere capriccio is actually one of weakest of the 'overdoors' in terms of quality, but nonetheless of interest. The very fact that it is poorly executed is a useful reminder of Canaletto's practice of employing assistants; he would probably have planned the composition, and then perhaps because of a need to finish the commission quickly allowed a member of his studio to carry out most of the work.The view is shown as though seen from the Bacino: at the left are the state granaries, and to the right the Zecca, or Mint. Between them is the Ponte della Pescaria, and beyond, the rear of the Procuratie Nuove. The artist has made the little bridge look more theatrical and impressive by depicting on it statues by Aspetti and Campagna which are in reality at the entrance to the Biblioteca Marciana

08701-coronati.jpg	From the surviving contract we know the name of the man, Jean de Montagnac, who commissioned this painting, Charonton's chef d'oeuvre, the exact date when it was painted, and the painter's name. The Coronation of the Virgin is the central scene of this enormous, elaborate composition.The decorative figure of the Virgin, floating in gold and red brocade in the middle distance, is flanked by God the Father and by Jesus, both depicted as men of the same age, with the same facial characteristics and clothes. On their right and left a multitude of smaller figures of the blessed angels, young children, monks, bishops, kings and popes, and the common folk adore the heavenly scene before them. Below, in a long miniature scene, Christ is raised up on high on the cross with the donor kneeling at its foot. To the right and left of the crucifix, in a horizontal landscape of sea and hills, are two walled towns, representing imaginary views of Jerusalem to the right and Rome to the left. The latter incorporates certain easily recognizable buildings of mediaeval Villeneuve-les-Avignon. The towns are respectively flanked by two subsidiary scenes of the Burning Bush and the Mass of St. Gregory; and below again the whole composition is completed by a more roughly sketched representation of tiny figures of the blessed and the damned at the Last Judgment. The Madonna is perhaps the most typically French creature in mediaeval French painting, a lovely woman with narrow eyes, a delicate face and slightly long nose.There are innumerable tiny details in this painting which charm, there is a mastery in the individuality of each of the human characters, a skill in the creation of the landscape, and great powers in the monumental fusion of numerous elements in the composition that combine to fill the onlooker with admiration, particularly as colours, forms and details all serve to focus attention on the inner meaning of the painting

33482-14mythol.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 481.In this painting Rembrandt depicts the episode form Ovid's Metamorphoses (Book VIII, 618-724). Jupiter and Mercury visit Philemon and Baucis, disguised as mortals. After being turned away at countless doors, they are given shelter by an old peasant couple, Philemon and Baucis. The couple provide the best meal they can and are about to kill their most precious possession, a goose, when Jupiter and Mercury reveal themselves. The gods invite them to climb a mountainside and, when they look back, they see all the country flooded except their cottage, which has been transformed into a magnificent temple. As a reward for their spontaneous generosity, Philemon and Baucis are made guardians of this temple for the rest of their lives.This is a rare instance from the later part of Rembrandt's career of his using a subject from Ovid's Metamorphoses.

00751-1prado.jpg	The Annunciation (154 x 194 cm) is the main painting on the altarpiece known as the Prado Altarpiece. There are five small (23 x 35 cm each) predella pictures below the Annunciation, painted on the same panel, depicting the story of the Virgin. The altarpiece, and especially the predella paintings are of extremely high quality thus without any doubts they are the works of Fra Angelico. The central image repeats a design Fra Angelico also used in an Annunciation in Cortona and in another at the head of the stairs to the dormitory of his monastery, San Marco in Florence.

35633-02sketch.jpg	The naked body of Christ lies stretched out on a bier, which occupies almost the entire breadth of the panel. Behind the bier the grief-stricken women, the Virgin and Mary Magdalene, stand tearing at their long, flowing hair. Two large torches in the background cast a flickering light over the scene, so that only the figures and the shroud stand out in the darkness of the room.The painter treated the theme of the Lamentation on several occasions. In Rubens' development of the subject, however, the Berlin sketch stands alone in that it was never followed up or even completed. The powerful effect produced by the three figures placed at right angles and reinforced by the uncannily empty areas of darkness might have been difficult to achieve in a larger format; the sketch bears all the signs of being a first idea. The modelling of the male body, the subtle use of shadow in the white cloth and not least the blonde tresses (rendered with a wide brush) which envelop the faces of the weeping women, all reveal the masterly assurance of the great Flemish artist.The women's violent gestures, the dramatic light-effect and the realism of the naked body were undoubtedly inspired by impressions gained while Rubens was in Italy, and in particular in Rome by the art of Caravaggio. We know that, during the years he spent in the south, the painter became preoccupied with the Lamentation as a theme. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to count this sketch among the works he produced in Italy, particularly as it was purchased from an Italian collection. Equally, however, the colours and brushwork of the small Lamentation suggest that, despite Rubens' southern memories, it may have been painted shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1609. That he continued for a long time to draw on the artistic experience he had gained in Italy is shown by the pictures he subsequently painted

11686-dante.jpg	The artist named himself after his master, a certain Michelino. He had his painterly training under Fra Angelico whose assistant he also became. His style is similar to that of Filippo Lippi and Pesellino.In this painting the three kingdoms are represented: the Purgatory in the centre background, the Hell at left, and the heavenly City at right. This painting is especially interesting because it shows us, apart from scenes of the Divine Comedy, a view of Florence in 1465, a Florence such as Dante himself could not have seen in his time.

The scenes are: Miracle of the Resurrected Child (scene 5, above left), Meditation (scene 6, above right), Division of the Cloak (scene 1, below left), and Dream of St Martin (scene 2, below right).The pictorial program of the chapel interior  includes ten scenes from the life of St martin, essentially based on the Golden Legend. All of the scenes are dominated by a calm, restrained, almost gentle narrative tone. There is no lack of genrelike elements, , far more powerful than these, however, are echoes of a courtly milieu, which are expressed openly in the penchant for chivalric motifs. The faces are usually very realistic, displaying a broad spectrum of physiognomic characterization and lively expression.  The colour was once more richly nuanced, but much of it has been lost as a result of the extensive use of secco painting

05459-2libro.jpg	The Madonna del Libro is a design that is extremely gentle and beautiful; it is a small vertical format panel painting. Mary and the Child are sitting in a corner of the room in front of the window, and her hand is resting on an open book. Some words are visible, showing that this is a Book of Hours, the Home beatae Mariae. As a symbol of his future Passion, the Christ Child is holding the three nails of the Cross and the crown of thorns.Botticelli created the additions to the scene with a great deal of loving detail, and the ensemble of boxes and a lavish fruit bowl is very much like a still-life. The parchment pages of the book, the materials and the transparent veils have an incredibly tangible quality to them. Another refinement of Botticelli's painting is the gold filigree with which he decorated the robes and objects. The use of expensive gold paint was a result of a contractual agreement made with the clients, which laid down the price of the painting

18825-fragment.jpg	This fresco was painted for the Hall of the Great Council in the Palazzo Ducale. Almost completely destroyed in the 1577 fire, the remains of the fresco were, in 1903, rediscovered under the large canvas Il Paradiso which Tintoretto was commissioned to paint for the same wall. Guariento's fresco, too, depicts Paradise. In the centre there is an enthroned Virgin being crowned by Christ, while, to far left and right, are aedicule like those from a portico church fa�ade, under which one can see the figures of the Annunciation: the Angel Gabriel on the left, and the Virgin Mary on the right. Angels playing musical instruments surround the central figures and the Evangelists are shown before the throne; saints, prophets and martyrs are depicted alongside in individual stalls with gothic tracery. The heat of the fire reduced the surviving fragments to a near monochrome, while in places where the plaster has fallen, one can see the red traces of the preliminary drawing

07549-36amor_v.jpg	"This paintings was always considered one of Caravaggio's great masterpieces. He painted it for Marchese Giustiniani. The figure sets up a direct, special and privileged relationship with the viewer, with an immediate appeal that is truly extraordinary. One is bewildered by this painting, by the absolute freedom that the subject obviously enjoys, detaching himself from mere mortals who must obey the laws of nature. The figure is in the act of mocking the world with a complete impunity, a self-assurance that produce a mixture of astonishment and envy. The figure has a torso that recalls Michelangelo's Victory.The painting probably shows Earthly Love triumphant over the Virtues and Sciences, symbolized by the musical instruments, pen and book, compass and square, scepter, laurel, and armor at his feet.Caravaggio's Amor, a teenager with a gloating smile, ""reigns"" over a pile of weapons, instruments, a book (sheet music), drawing utensils, and a laurel wreath. He places his left knee lightly over these objects, while he holds a bunch of arrows in his right hand. Since the attributes of war, military glory, science and arts are scattered at Amor's feet, the painting reminds the viewer of a Vanitas still-life. Some objects in this still-life are emphasized: pieces of a suit of armour, a lute and a violin with a bow. These may refer to Mars and Venus, who, according to some classical genealogies, including that of Virgil's Aeneid I. 664, were the parents of the playful little winged deity Amor.Thus in this painting the musical instruments represent Venus herself rather than either art in general or, through the association of fading melodies, transitoriness of human life. It is likely, of course, that the viewer of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may have thought of all the previous connotations, too, since he was used to the multiple meanings of symbols."

03157-manpor.jpg	This portrait shows a combination of stylistic features relating to both Venetian and German traditions. Accordingly, it was first attributed to northern Italian painters, more specifically to Bartolomeo Veneto, then German artists, specifically to Bernhard Strigel. More recently, the attribution to Jacopo de' Barbari has gained general acceptance.The Venetian Jacopo de' Barbari worked at various princely courts north of the Alps between 1500 and his death. It is known that while he was still in Venice he was already interested in northern European culture. The present painting may date a time when he was working on his famous woodcut view of Venice.The sitter of the portrait has not been identified. The man with the blond hair and northern attire could be a well-to-do German, probably a merchant, one of the German residents in Venice.

34708-wedding.jpg	In the work of Robinson, North America made its own first influential contribution to Impressionism. Though a good friend of Monet from 1886 on, he never became dependent on the Frenchman's style. The years Robinson spent at Giverny before finally returning to the US in 1892 fell into two stylistic periods. In the first, he painted figures in landscape settings as well as pure landscapes. (La d�b�cle represents this style.) In the second phase the individual features were dissolved into highlights of colour that were stripped of contour or detail. The Wedding March, painted in 1982 for the wedding of the American artist Theodore Earl Butler and Suzanne Hosched�-Monet, Monet's stepdaughter, is a fine example of this phase

The painting is associated with Courbet's stay at Monpellier during the summer of 1854. The composition is simultaneously narrative and symbolic. It echoes the popular image (well known to Courbet) showing ""the burghers of the town speaking to the wandering Jew,"" and it is capable of a reading as the meeting of money and genius.

21947-4lastsu1.jpg	The most celebrated Last Supper was painted by Leonardo da Vinci around 1494-98 in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. The real dining room appears to be continued in the perspectivally painted one, but on a higher level: the prior's table is upstaged by that of Christ and the apostles above. Christ and the apostles seem to have taken their place in the monk's dining hall in Milan, as it were. The emphatic gestures of the larger-than-life-size, heroic figures would have contrasted once with the quiet, controlled meal of the monks. A sublime, sacred drama overshadowed the worldly meal and focused the brothers' attention religious meditation. Leonardo depicted a specific moment of the Last Supper: Christ has just announced that he will be betrayed by one of the disciples, and the community of apostles reacts with agitation and questioning. The brothers found here a painted exemplar for their explorations of their own conscience; Judas's offence warned them not to betray the monastic community and its regulations

37058-4damned1.jpg	The account of the Apocalypse continues with three large scenes, the Resurrection of the Flesh, the Damned and the Elect, and two smaller ones on either side of the chapel's window, Paradise and Hell.It is primarily in this section of the fresco cycle that Signorelli has given free rein to his inventive genius. An inventiveness that, as Berenson said, made him one of the greatest of modern illustrators, and thanks to which his art is still an extremely important part of our figurative heritage. Despite the rhetorical devices, the theatrical ruses and the occasional contrived details, despite the limitations in his draughtsmanship and use of colour recognized by all modern critics, there is no denying that never before in Italian art had figurative ideas of such unforgettable power been used. Viewed all together the huge frescoes in the Orvieto chapel give an impression of overcrowding and of confusion which is far from pleasing. We have to isolate the individual details in order to grasp the greatness of Signorelli the 'illustrator' and the 'inventor' and therefore justify Berenson's statement.Signorelli's fresco cycle in Orvieto is full of humour, grotesque inventions, erotic allusions and ribald jokes. There is no need to refer to the profane spirit of the Renaissance to explain this. On the contrary, these scenes fit in very well with the idea of the Cathedral as theatrum mundi, as the mirror image of the whole universe, and they are fully in the spirit of the religious plays of the time. Basically, neither Signorelli nor his patrons wanted to do without the enjoyment provided by story-telling, a typically Italian style based on humorous and imaginative details. But this in no way invalidates the dogmatic truth of the prophecies relating to the end of the world, which, especially in those turbulent years, really came across as a terrifying threat. It becomes quite understandable that Michelangelo would have been really interested in these Orvieto frescoes. But he in no way imitated Luca's work , (as Vasari would have us believe), for the spirituality and the moral content of the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel have absolutely nothing in common with the theatrical representation in Orvieto. Michelangelo perhaps found in Signorelli's frescoes a useful iconographical repertory, a catalogue of surprising and unusual inventions.In any case the parts of the fresco cycle that would have attracted Michelangelo's curiosity most would certainly have been the scenes with devils and other imaginary figures, those scenes that were best suited to Signorelli's eccentric temperament, to his irony and macabre humour

42180-virgin_c.jpg	In the mid-1460s Pope Pius II commissioned four of Siena's leading painters to execute altarpieces for his newly completed cathedral in Pienza. These were the two slightly older painters Sano di Pietro and Giovanni di Paolo, the tried and tested Vecchietta, and a younger painter, Matteo di Giovanni. The cathedral was built by the Florentine architect Bernardo Rossellino according to the patron's taste for both Italian renaissance architecture and the tall, luminous interiors of north European churches, it was furnished entirely according to his preferences and wishes.Each of the four painters executed an altarpiece whose form and subject matter appears to have been closely controlled by their humanist patron. Vecchietta's takes the distinctive form of a kind of unified triptych, depicting the Virgin of the Assumption in the centre and pairs of saints on either side. These are Agatha, Pius, Calixtus and Catherine of Siena. Destined to be placed over the altar in the chapel to the left of the central chapel (when facing towards it), its subject honoured the dedication of the cathedral to the Virgin of the Assumption; the identities of the patron, Pius II, and his own patron and papal predecessor, Pope Calixtus III; and the Sienese saint whom Pius had canonised in 1461.While recalling the original design and gilded magnificence of the patronal altarpieces for Siena cathedral, this altarpiece was rendered in a notably contemporary manner, the framework adopting the repertoire of Renaissance architecture - simple, rectangular mouldings and a round (not pointed) arch, surmounted by a triangular pediment. The central image of the Virgin of the Assumption also demonstrates Vecchietta's confident handling of pictorial spaces, both in terms of the angels grouped in a circle below the seated figure of the Virgin and in the lyrical landscape behind the figure of Saint Thomas in the lower foreground. The pairs of saints on either side of this image stand on a pavement embellished with circles, likewise seen in depth. These saints too are portrayed as substantial figures who relate to one another

39643-1crownin.jpg	"In the Crowning with Thorns, painted for the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, the space is compressed in the scene by arranging the figures on a shallow plane delimited by the wall of a building. There are explicit references to antiquity: the figure of Christ derives from the celebrated Laocoon, an antique statue discovered in Rome in 1506, an archetypal exemplum doloris (""example of pain""). Another famous antique sculptural fragment, the Belvedere Torso, provides the model for the upper body of the torturer on the left. With the inclusion of the bust of Tiberius Caesar, a direct reference to the Roman authorities who condemned Christ, Titian also pays homage to the classical past. This is a brutal scene, in which Christ's tormentors twist the crown onto his head with their canes, but the violence is relieved and Christ's suffering exalted by the beauty of the colours, which especially in the blue and green to the right are colder than usual in deference to Titian's Roman sources. In Christ's foot extended on the steps, however, Titian pulls out all the Venetian stops and one can sense the blood flowing through the veins under the flesh. The pattern of the canes slices through the massed figures like the strokes of a knife, forming a Trinitarian triangle to the right of Christ's head. An inimitable Titian touch is the cane lying unused on the foremost step, still, shadowless and deadly, like a snake"

39740-06danae.jpg	"It was through Aretino in 1539 that Titian first offered his services to the family of the Farnese Pope Paul III. After painting the Pope's grandson Ranuccio in 1542, Titian's next commission for the family was a Dana&#235; seduced by Jupiter in the guise of a shower of gold coin. He began the canvas in Venice in 1544 for Ranuccio's elder brother, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, and when he left for Rome the following year, he took it with him to finish. Giorgio Vasari, the biographer and protege of Michelangelo, brought the Master to see it. The latter was full of compliments in Titian's presence, but according to Vasari later complained that, though he liked the colouring and style, ""it was a pity that in Venice they never learned to draw and that their painters did not have a better method of study.""The pose is obviously Michelangelesque while the cupid is based on a statue in the style of Lysippus, which Titian would have known since it was already in Venice in the collection of Cardinal Grimani.X-rays reveal an underlying composition close to the Venus of Urbino, but as a papal legate remarked to Cardinal Alessandro, the erotic Dana&#235; made the Venus of Urbino look like ""a Theatine nun"".

20176-aragon.jpg	"The inscription ""Queen Catharine, his wife"" suggests that the portrait was part of a pair, the other being of Henry VIII. Dated to around 1525-1527, this small work is among the earliest English portrait miniatures. The cherry-shaped mouth is typical of the style of the Dutch painter Lucas Horenbout, who was employed by Henry VIII as a court painter from 1525 to his death in 1544.Catherine of Aragon (1485-1536) was the first wife of King Henry VIII of England. The refusal of Pope Clement VII to annul Henry's marriage to Catherine triggered the break between Henry and Rome and led to the English Reformation.Catherine was the youngest daughter of the Spanish rulers Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. In 1501 she married Prince Arthur, eldest son of King Henry VII of England. Arthur died the following year, and shortly afterward she was betrothed to Prince Henry, the second son of Henry VII. But subsequent rivalry between England and Spain and Ferdinand's refusal to pay the full dowry prevented the marriage from taking place until her fianc� assumed the throne as Henry VIII in 1509. For some years the couple lived happily. Catherine matched the breadth of her husband's intellectual interests, and she was a competent regent while he was campaigning against the French (1512-14).Between 1510 and 1518 Catherine gave birth to six children, including two sons, but all except Mary (later queen of England, 1553-58) either were stillborn or died in early infancy. Henry's desire for a legitimate male heir prompted him in 1527 to appeal to Rome for an annulment on the grounds that the marriage had violated the biblical prohibition against a union between a man and his brother's widow. Catherine appealed to Pope Clement VII, contending that her marriage to Henry was valid because the previous marriage to Arthur had never been consummated.For seven years the Pope avoided issuing the annulment because he could not alienate Catherine's nephew, the Holy Roman emperor Charles V. Finally Henry separated from Catherine in July 1531. On May 23, 1533 - five months after he married Anne Boleyn - he had his own archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, annul the marriage to Catherine. Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy repudiating all papal jurisdiction in England and making the king head of the English church. Although Catherine had always been loved by the English people, Henry forced her to spend her last years isolated from all public life"

07830-1consec.jpg	The scene of St Stephen with Four Followers being Consecrated Deacons by St Peter, now in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin, is signed and dated 1511; following his typical composition formula, Carpaccio sets the actual event in the foreground, arranged in a series of figure groups articulated in a scansion that creates separate relationships with the landscape, conceived with depth of field and dotted with a great number of complex architectural structures. The use of motifs from his earlier works, primarily from the San Giorgio degli Schiavoni cycle, and the numerous references to the art of Cima, Giovanni Bellini and even Pisanello, detracts from the unity of composition constructed around a colour web woven with deep and full shadowy areas.

00471-venus_a3.jpg	The story of Venus and Adonis, which has attracted not only artists but poets, including Shakespeare, tells that Adonis was the offspring of the incestuous union of King Cinyras of Paphos, in Cyprus, with his daughter Myrrha. His beauty was a byword. Venus conceived a helpless passion for him as a result of a chance graze she received from Cupid's arrow (Met. 10:524-559). One day while out hunting Adonis was slain by a wild boar, an accident Venus had always dreaded (Met. 10:708-739). Hearing his dying groans as she flew overhead in her chariot, she came down to aid him but was too late. In the place where the earth was stained with Adonis' blood, anemones sprouted. Artists usually depict two scenes, Amigoni painted both.The second scene is shown on this picture. In the forest a grieving Venus is pouring the nectar that causes Adonis' blood to fertilize the earth. Cupid assists her. Venus' chariot stands nearby

07625-73ursula.jpg	This, another of the newly rediscovered paintings by Caravaggio, dates to his final weeks in Naples, before the ill-fated sea-trip back towards Rome and the pardon which was awaiting him. Saint Ursula was a popular Christian saint, remembered for her legendary refusal to marry a pagan Hun. Caravaggio has picked on the climactic moment of her martyrdom, when her frustrated suitor has just fired an arrow at her - here at point-blank range which is piercing her breast.In the dimly lit scene the saint gazes at the arrow with an air of quiet concern, while the Hun stares at her, his eyes shaded in darkness, one attendant looking at his hand and another, who must be modelled on Caravaggio himself, peering from the back, anxious to watch the proceedings. It is the last time that Caravaggio sees himself as an anguished spectator, but in pictorial terms the painting seems to presage what might have been a fresh stage in his career, for the Hun is painted with a new boldness in the brushwork. The varnish was still wet in May. In early July, Caravaggio was dead

04893-p_ruyter.jpg	Michiel de Ruyter (1607-1676) was one of the most famous admirals in Dutch history. He is most famous for his role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century. His victories in the naval battles of the Dutch War of Independence and later during the Anglo-Dutch wars assured his place not only as a national hero, but also as one of the most respected admirals in history. His greatest military achievement was the Four Days' Battle  of June 1666, which resulted in defeat for the English navy. De Ruyter was then asked to commission his own portrait in six copies, to be hung in the chambers of the regional offices of the admiralty in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg, Harlingen, Enkhuizen and Hoorn.The commission to execute the portraits was awarded to Ferdinand Bol. Six almost identical copies of the official portrait of the commander-in-chief of the Dutch fleet were therefore made, of which four are still known today.In the portrait De Ruyter is shown in three-quarter length, dressed in ceremonial attire with gold buttons and a thick gold belt, holding his admiral's baton. Around his neck he wears the chain of the Order of Saint Michael. His arm is resting on a celestial globe made by the celebrated Blaeu Company. The fleet appearing in the background of the portrait was executed by Willem van de Velde the Younger. As was common practice in the studios of the time, such traditional details in portraits of naval commanders were generally executed by artists who specialized in marine scenes

10661-17csont.jpg	"The way Csontv�ry saw nature, was summed up in ""Baalbek"" (1906). Although he was still interested in nature, he went new ways in art. After the exhibition in Paris in 1907, his pictures with cedars painted in Lebanon, which were full of symbols and visions, started a new period.Trees are referred to in the mythology of almost all nations as symbols of fertility or those of  knowledge. In the case of cedars, Csontv�ry did not only want to portray a motif of nature, but he connected his message to a well-known and universal symbol. Art historians and psychologists involved in the Csontv�ry-literature  identified ""The Lonely Cedar"" with the lonely Csontv�ry, while the ""Pilgrimage to Cedars in Lebanon"", its counterpart, was identified with the artist celebrated by others and himself. The latter work may be a symbolic repetition of his early ""Self-Portrait"" but in this picture the artist symbolizes his own self in the cedar tree.The truth of the statement is supported by Csontv�ry's writings, he mentions the tree as a symbol of his own person.The order, the composition and the colours of the picture are subordinated to a world full of symbols. The double trunks of the tree  in the axis of the picture arrange and hold together events with their branches growing upwards in a sophisticated pattern. A celebration recalling ancient rituals takes place around them. The whole picture is interwoven by experiences with nature and the presence of ""energies"" in different shapes, which Csontv�ry thought to be important. The complicated symbols of the picture carry different contents, but they are ""manifestations of Csontv�ry's magic concept of the world, and as such, visual realizations of symbols arising from the depth of the human soul"" (Lajos N�meth)"

37326-1orsini.jpg	"The altarpiece known as Passion Polyptych (or Orsini Polyptych), with panels now in a number of European museums (Angel of the Annunciation and Virgin of Annunciation, as well as Crucifixion and Deposition in Antwerp, the Road to Calvary in Paris and the Entombment in Berlin) is signed ""Pinxit Symon"" on the two panels of the Crucifixion and the Deposition. It presents several problems, both in terms of stylistic analysis and dating.Some scholars, stressing the fact that it is so different stylistically from all the other works of Simone's Avignon period (nervous lines and expressions), think that it may have been painted earlier and then transported to France; others believe that it may be a late work, commissioned by Napoleone Orsini, who died in the Curia in Avignon in 1342. Orsini's coat-of-arms appears in the background of the Road to Calvary. The polyptych was probably transferred to the charterhouse of Champmol, near Dijon, in the late 14th century"

07497-21narcis.jpg	The attribution of this painting to Caravaggio has been discussed at length and it is still questioned by some scholars. There are no contemporary sources to refer to, and the attribution rests entirely on stylistic bases.The theory that the picture is by Caravaggio might be confirmed by an export license dating to 1645, referring to a Narcissus by Caravaggio of similar measurements to our canvas. While it is difficult to propose with absolute certainty a secure connection between the document and the present canvas, several major Caravaggio scholars have reconsidered the issue, accepted the link between the license and the painting, and confirmed the autograph quality of the work.Analysis of the details of execution (carried out as part of a recent restoration), stylistic comparison to other works of Caravaggio, and the iconographic innovativeness of the subject all lead to acceptance of the Narcissus as a work of Caravaggio. On the subject of invention, it suffices to mention the exceptional the double figure which - like a playing card - turns on the fulcrum of the highlit knee at the centre of the composition.The work belongs to the years between 1597 and 1599, a transitional period of Caravaggio's career that is still not entirely sorted out or fully understood. It is a moment in which Caravaggio tended towards a magical sense of atmosphere, suspense, and introspection: still strongly influenced by the Lombard style of Moretto and Savoldo, he is also testing the infinite possibilities of light and shadow. Dating from the same phase of Caravaggio's career are the Lute Player, the Doria Magdalene, and above all the Thyssen St Catherine and Detroit Magdalene, with which our canvas has many connections and resonances

19085-04morsch.jpg	In aristocratic and elite circles the international courtly taste for historiated portraits was occasionally followed. These works show sitters in the guise of classical; mythological, allegorical, literary, and even biblical characters implying that the model possessed the virtues of the personages whose roles they play. But character and status was most often depicted in a more mundane way by the naturalistic portrayals of patrons dressed in the fashion of their time and class, although then, as now, there were older people who preferred to be seen wearing clothes that were the 'dernier cri' when they were young. Additionally, then, as now, accessories and props were introduced to allude to the character or profession of sitters or to abstract ideas. Decoding their meanings is not always as straightforward as it may seem. The modern spectacles through which we look at portraits of another epoch can obscure their meaning.Consider the smoked herring held in one hand by Pieter van der Morsch and the herrings he has in his straw basket in Frans Hals's portrait of him. At first blush his herrings appear to identify him as a fisherman or fishmonger hawking his wares. This seemingly convincing interpretation, which had been accepted since the portrait entered the literature in the nineteenth century, appears to be clinched by the conspicuous inscription: 'WIE BEGEERT' (Who Desires [One]). However, a close study of the seventeenth-century iconology of the smoked herring and of what could be learned about van der Morsch from contemporary sources demonstrated this interpretation is wrong. Van der Morsch was not a fisherman or fishmonger. He was a Leiden municipal court messenger who belonged to one of the city's literary societies where he played the part of a buffoon. A book of his own verse includes an epitaph he composed for himself. In it he characterizes himself as a man who distributes smoked herrings. Ample evidence establishes that in his time 'to give someone a smoked herring' (iemand een bokking geven) meant to shame someone with a sharp rebuke. The inscription on the painting is not a reference to the sale of smoked herrings. It refers to van der Morsch's readiness to ridicule. In Hals's painting the smoked herrings and inscription have been used to portray van der Morsch in his role as the wise fool of his literary society

26563-03_3ce3.jpg	In the centre of the background, Noah officiates at the sacrifice on an altar seen cornerways on. Giving thanks to the Lord for his salvation from the waters, the patriarch is wearing the same blood-red tunic that he wore when he was tilling the vineyard in the background of the Drunkenness of Noah. The work of assistants has been detected in the figure of Noah's wife on the right, surrounded by rigid outlines and modeled in a cursory manner, and also in the one of the youth on the left who, lighting the fire under the altar with a torch, shields his face from the heat with his hand.The figures of the youth dragging the ram and the one taking the viscera of the animals were painted by Domenico Carnevali around 1568, after the original figures were lost as a result of the detachment of the intonaco caused by instability in the structure of the wall. Noah's Offering has frequently been compared to classical scenes of votive offerings or sacrifice. And rightly so. But here a new element enters and points towards the future. It is the elliptical composition, partly hidden in the shape of a rhomb, which recurs later (especially in the cartoon by Raphael for a tapestry depicting the death of Ananias, finished a few years after the Sistine) and which was adopted by many artists. This typical Baroque motif has two focal points; unity is divided between two separate poles. The sons of Noah as two athletic acolytes are very much in evidence, while the main celebrant, bending over the sacrificial hearth, is inconspicuous in the background. The unrest of gesticulating bodies detracts from the spirit of the sacred rite

18803-4tobias.jpg	What further possibilities could be squeezed from the rococo after Tiepolo were developed by the Guardi brothers and by Fragonard. Gian Antonio and Francesco Guardi represent the same phenomenon, probably active in the same studio and possibly in some sort of collaboration, until the death of Gian Antonio in 1760. Out of the art particularly of Pellegrini they produced a more dazzlingly coloured, more melting style - but one that had none of Pellegrini's international success, being restricted chiefly to serving a decorative function in obscure churches and villas of the Veneto. In many ways the closest affinities of this style are with Maulbertsch, and it remains more typical of the Tyrol than of Venice. Their compositions are quite often shamelessly borrowed; when not borrowed they are often shamelessly incoherent. In them objects are splintered by light in a sort of proto-impressionism. Perspective, organized aerial space, the Palladian solidity of Tiepolo, these are exchanged for a personal style of coloured handwriting - now brilliantly calligraphic, and now brilliantly cloudy, which uses reality as a sparking off point.The most perfect expression of this style remains in the Tobias series for the organ loft of the church of Angelo Raffaele in Venice. In them it is as if the brush had barely touched the surface of the canvas, so rapidly does it move, obeying its own laws, and leaving the whole surface crackling with vitality. Everything shares the same texture, given by the painter. The compositions, framed by trees, set within deliberately decorative fronds and branches, are as capricious as some fan-design by Watteau. Normal reality has been dissolved and replaced by a new luminous atmosphere in which everything exists only in so far as light defines it.

13918-landscap.jpg	This signed and dated painting was rediscovered in the 1980s. This painting is comparable in style and technique to the Landscape with Obelisk (formerly in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, stolen in 1990) which was almost universally accepted as an autograph Rembrandt until it was discovered that it too bore the remnants of Flinck's signature that had been faked into his master's.

43024-madonna.jpg	Verrocchio was a great sculptor as well as painter, one who also worked in relief and in precious metals. Such versatility is found even in two dimensions, for the painter's Madonna and Child has a sense of the oblique, of outreach and exchange. Exploration of landscape and an equally keen concern for light's passage and of chiaroscuro are often part of the painter-sculptor's concerns. Here, fascination for mysterious coils of drapery and twisted veils, for the dynamic found even in the row of ties along Mary's sleeve, bespeak a new role for the artist, one enhanced by technical variety and virtuosity

19998-6rakoczi.jpg	"Holl�sy painted the first sketch for ""R�k�czi March"" in the autumn of 1885 and kept returning to the composition but he never got to a solution which he thought  would match his concept. Only few of his sketches survived  and demonstrate the artist's efforts, the most interesting of them is a study from the year 1899. The illustration painted for  ""Fires"", a poem by J�zsef Kiss, served as a predecessor to the picture both in content and form, where Holl�sy portrayed the revolutionary enthusiasm in people  pushing  forwards desperately. People are pushing forwards as if they were waves while the march is being played and people cannot be held up. Dust is stirred up as people are marching, light becomes  scattered - as a result, there are no forms and contours, there are decorative patches, and the scene becomes visionary.""This is not a historical picture in the traditional sense, although one might call it that, since it condenses the truest conflict of its time. Holl�sy wanted to express the greatest ambition of the suppressed Hungarian people. His figures were borrowed from his time. The ineradicable experience of the war of independence is included in this picture, but the revolts of the 1890s are also anticipated, thus Holl�sy goes beyond class barriers of his contemporaries"".

35604-06landsc.jpg	Saint George and the Dragon symbolises the close relationship established between Rubens and the court of Charles I. The subject honours the patron saint of England and of the Order of the Garter, founded by Edward III in 1348. The features of Saint George are traditionally stated to be those of Charles I, while the figure of the Empress Cleodelinde is, according to the same tradition, intended to be Queen Henrietta Maria. The verdant landscape is also a form of flattery in so far as it is inspired by the English countryside. Indeed, the background was described by Croft-Murray as 'probably Rubens's single essay in English landscape.' Some of the buildings are identifiable, although their contiguity is purely imaginary. On the left of the composition, for example, is the square church tower of St Mary Overy (now Southwark Cathedral) and to the right of this possibly the Banqueting House with Westminster Abbey before Hawksmoor's towers were added. Further down river on the right of the composition is an interpretation of Lambeth Palace.The canvas was extended by the artist, evidently sometime between 1630 and 1635. These additions betoken extensive rethinking of the design. The original concept was to have been contained within the central section and is recorded in a drawing in Stockholm (National Museum). This was preceded by a study in Berlin of motifs occurring in the right half of the composition. These drawings show that the horseman on the right was at first balanced on the left by a woman standing with a child, forms which can still be discerned between the trunks of the two trees and which are even more obvious by X-ray. They were omitted, however, when the composition was enlarged, possibly because they did not constitute a sufficiently strong counterpoint. The other elements of the composition, especially on the right, were merely rearranged on a broader scale. It is conceivable that some iconographical refinements were also made in order to sharpen the allegorical meaning. What remains of this central part is of good quality, particularly the flickering evening light and damp atmosphere so characteristic of the Thames Valley, and can be assigned to Rubens himself. The additions, however, are less adroitly handled and may have been left to studio assistants. The initial composition perhaps relates to the engraving of the same subject by Lucas van Leyden. The works of Pordenone, Titian, Polidoro da Caravaggio, Veronese and the Carracci family all inspired the artist in carrying out this political allegory which, in the context of the reign of Charles I, clearly has religious connotations with particular reference to Saint George

03989-bello301.jpg	Following his departure from Dresden Bellotto lived in Vienna from 1758 till 1761, where he worked for Empress Maria Theresa and her courtiers Kaunitz and Liechtenstein. The paintings he executed for the court have been imperial property ever since. For a long time most of them were kept at the Castle of Laxenburg. Since 1890 they have all been preserved in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.The Lobkowitzplatz, the former Schweinemarkt, is seen from the southwest, with Palais Dietrichstein &#151; later Lobkowitz &#151; on the left and on the right the Burgerspital. On the opposite side of the square, in front of the wall of the Capuchin monastery, rises the Missionskreuz. On the left the apse of the Dorothea Church on the Spiegelgasse can still be seen, while in the background the tower of St. Stephen's Cathedral stands out against the light.Bellotto, however, has not represented visual reality as it appeared to him, but rather &#151; following his visual practice &#151; chosen to beautify it. In fact Bellotto has made a composite of two separate views in this canvas.Bellotto's paintings for Maria Theresa may be divided into two groups: views of imperial palaces and views within the city of Vienna. The six Viennese town views fall into three sets of two paintings each. In terms of both form and content, the Lobkowitzplatz forms a pair together with the Mehlmarkt (also in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Though the Lobkowitzplatz and the Mehlmarkt seem at first sight to be traditional representations of a square or a palace on a square, on closer inspection these paintings appear to have a monastery in common, which probably is the true subject of the paintings. Whereas the present canvas depicts the back wall around the Capuchin monastery, its companion piece shows the main entrance of the Capuchin church.The other four works in this group can also be divided into two pairs. There are two paintings which show the Monastery of the Scots and two showing the buildings of the Jesuits and the Jesuit-led University of Vienna.

07935-assump.jpg	In 1600 Annibale Carracci and Caravaggio received a joint commission from Tiberio Cerasi to decorate his chapel in the Santa Maria del Popolo. Annibale was responsible for the design of the ceiling frescoes and painted The Assumption of the Virgin for the altar, while Caravaggio undertook the two lateral paintings, which depict The Crucifixion of St Peter and The Conversion of St Paul.
