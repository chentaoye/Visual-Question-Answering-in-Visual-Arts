33523-37portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 173.This painting is a record of the meeting between two of the most remarkable figures in Dutch history: the elderly and combative Remonstrant preacher Johannes Wtenbogaert (1557-1644), whose fame must have been at its height at that time, and the up-and-coming Rembrandt van Rijn, who stood on the threshold of celebrity.Wtenbogaert was also portrayed by Michiel Janszoon van Miereveld and Jacob Adriaenszoon Backer.

39256-09george.jpg	St George and the Dragon is a small, even miniature, painting in the context of Tintoretto's work, detailed and highly finished. It was probably commissioned as a private altarpiece, and the conventional arched vertical format had never before, and has rarely since, been used to such dynamic and disturbing effect. The imagery also is unusual. The story of St George of Cappadocia, Roman officer and Christian martyr, was made popular in Western Europe through The Golden Legend, a calendar-book of tales of the lives of the saints compiled in the late thirteenth century. It is there that we find the story of a dragon terrorising the countryside demanding human sacrifice. When the fatal lot fell to Cleodolinda, the daughter of the king, St George, riding by on his charger, turned to help her and vanquished the dragon 'in the name of Christ'. In a departure from tradition, Tintoretto has shown the livid cadaver of a previous victim in the pose of the crucified Christ and included God the Father in the heavens blessing the victory of good over evil. The terrified princess, fleeing uphill from the dragon climbing out of the sea, nearly stumbles out of the foreground. St George has galloped into the painting from our right, the direction of a hidden source of light which picks out the trunks of the trees, the rump of the horse, the armour of the knight and the flesh and garments of Cleodolinda

42379-council.jpg	The most famous admiral in Dutch history, Michiel de Ruyter, enjoyed an international reputation and received numerous honours from other countries. De Ruyter was born in Flushing port in 1607, and first went to sea when he was only eleven years old. His navigating skills brought him rapid advancement. De Ruyter was employed by the Admiralty, in Zeeland in 1652 and in Amsterdam a year later. As vice-admiral of the fleet he took part in the numerous sea battles the Dutch fought against England. In 1665 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the Dutch fleet. He won a number of victories, but the pinnacle of his career was undoubtedly the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672-1674), in which his superior tactics enabled him to keep a large Anglo-French fleet away from the Dutch coast. De Ruyter was killed at Syracuse in 1676, and was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam.This pen drawing by Willem van de Velde depicts the council of war on the eve of the four-day naval battle during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667). The battle, which took place on 11-14 June 1666, was won by the Dutch fleet under De Ruyter's command. The result, however, was disappointing: the English fleet was not destroyed, and losses on the Dutch side were almost as great

04413-phaeton.jpg	In Greek mythology Phaethon was the son of Helios, the sun-god. Helios drove his golden chariot, a 'quadriga' yoked to a team of four horses abreast, daily across the sky. Phaethon persuaded his unwilling father to allow him for one day to drive his chariot across the skies. Because he had no skill he was soon in trouble, and the climax came when he met the fearful Scorpion of the zodiac. He dropped the reins, the horses bolted and caused the earth itself to catch fire. In the nick of time Jupiter, father of the goods, put a stop to his escapade with a thunderbolt which wrecked the chariot and sent Phaethon hurtling down in flames into the River Eridanus (according to some, the Po). He was buried by nymphs.  Phaethons's reckless attempt to drive his father's chariot made him the symbol of all who aspire to that which lies beyond their capabilities.

43366-sacra_co.jpg	The heavy plasticity of Bartolomeo Vivarini and Andrea da Murano was soon surpassed by the more balanced and harmonious three-dimensional quality of the works of Antonello da Messina. His St Cassiano altarpiece of 1476, fragments of which are now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was studied and admired by a whole generation of painters. One of the first to be inspired by it was Alvise Vivarini, son of Antonio and follower of his uncle Bartolomeo, who soon went on to become a major exponent of Antonello's theories of crystalline form and colour. His major work coming from the first and much-admired studio of Messina is the Sacra Conversazione dated 1480, originally in the church of San Francesco in Treviso.The painting is composed with geometrical symmetry: the two groups of saints, Louis of Toulouse, Anthony of Padua and Anne on the left and Joachim, Bernardino and Francesco Gioacchino on the right, face inwards towards the enthroned Virgin. In their gestures immobilized by the cold light which comes from the top left-hand corner, the three-dimensional figures appear to form a kind of architecture the centre of which is the throne, a construction of cylinders and parallelepipeds, behind which the curtain falls heavily excluding from sight all natural elements apart from two small fragments of a cold, clouded sky. Shadows appear to cut into the floor, confirmation of the geometrical relationship between space and figures, while the clear line delineates areas of pure enamel-like colour. This theory of formal abstraction was to become during the last few years of the 15th century still more monumental, in contrast to the ideas of colourization and sublime naturalness represented by Giovanni Bellini.Recent examination has revealed that the green curtain in the background was added at a later date. The panel is signed and dated on the dais of the throne

19904-02seymou.jpg	Jane Seymour (1509-1537) was the third wife of King Henry VIII of England and mother of King Edward VI. She succeeded - where Henry's previous wives had failed - in providing a legitimate male heir to the throne.Jane's father was Sir John Seymour of Wolf Hall, Savernake, Wiltshire. She became a lady in waiting to Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then to Anne Boleyn, who married the King in 1533. Henry probably became attracted to Jane in 1535, when he visited her father at Wolf Hall, but, though willing to marry him, she refused to be his mistress. That determination undoubtedly helped bring about Anne Boleyn's downfall and execution (May 19, 1536). On May 30, 1536, Henry and Jane were married privately.During the remaining 17 months of her life Jane managed to restore Mary, Henry's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, to the King's favour. Mary was a Roman Catholic, and some scholars have interpreted Jane's intercession to mean that she had little sympathy with the English Reformation. The future Edward VI was born on October 12, 1537, but, to Henry's genuine sorrow, Jane died 12 days later.Holbein executed this portrait shortly after the marriage of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour. In attitude and expression, the Seymour portrait matches that in the Whitehall composition, but the portraits differ in the arrangement of the bonnet veil; this individual portrait follows the preparatory study in the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle. This change is important only from a compositional point of view, and probably derived from Holbein himself. However, the major changes in tonality and patterns in Jane's gown will probably have been undertaken only after consultation with the client.Holbein's portrait depicts a figure frozen in an official sense of responsibility. The simplicity of the shadowed background accentuates the increasing richness and boldness of design and adornment in Henrician court fashion, and the artist's skill is pre-eminent in creating the sheen and lustre of the precious stones. Great attention has been paid to the realism of the silver thread in the queen's dress, and this new opulence was to be echoed in the portrait of Henry himself.

07946-rest_f_e.jpg	"During his years in Rome, Annibale was an enthusiastic exponent of a cleansed classical art. He paid tribute to it in the amazing ceiling that he spent the last years of his life painting in the Palazzo Farnese. On this, and also on the large landscape lunettes in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Annibale was helped by young assistants, nearly all from Emilia, who subsequently established the classical style there that proved to be so successful. Annibale Carracci's reputation as an ""academic artist"" and the fact that for over three centuries he has been regarded as a paradigm of classical style, has meant that for too long we have overlooked his no less fascinating handling of nature, evident in his Landscape with the Flight into Egypt. But the melancholy which can be glimpsed in that landscape, whose symmetry almost anticipates Poussin's, overwhelmed Annibale as a man and he stopped painting toward the end of his life.

17072-paris22.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 363, JH 1351.The sitter in this portrait was the colour-merchant Tanguy, a Breton peasant who had settled in Paris and ran a small paint shop in the Rue Clauzel, much frequented by vanguard artists. His shop had become a kind of gallery of their paintings, for Tanguy would take paintings on deposit as credit for the painting materials he supplied. Van Gogh painted two portraits of P�re Tanguy in the autumn and early winter of 1887, both against a background composed of Japanese colour woodcuts which he had begun to collect, firstly in Antwerp and then more avidly in Paris. Tanguy is placed massively in the centre of the canvas, facing the spectator. But the Paris merchant is presented not against an urban or even French setting, but in an imaginary context composed of Japanese seasonal scenes and costumed figures. Although this choice of background indicates van Gogh's evident preoccupation with Japanese prints - he also made individual copies of selected prints at this date - the painting does not indicate any profound influence of Japanese graphic styles or perspectival devices upon his work. But it is important to note that the motifs represented in the prints anticipate those that van Gogh would shortly resume when he left Paris and moved once again into a more rural setting - seasonal landscapes and portraits of regional types in costume.In his portraits of ordinary people van Gogh emphasized their sadness, dignity and kindness.

For reasons of size, style, and subject matter, the following paintings probably came from the retable: the Annunciation, the widest painting, in the centre (the church was dedicated to the Virgin of the Annunciation); the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ, two paintings of the same size, on the left and right of the Annunciation; the Crucifixion above the Annunciation; and the Resurrection and Pentecost, another pair of identical size, flanking the Crucifixion (the whole forming a retable of a type known in the Escorial). Such an arrangement gives a chronological sequence to the events of the Life of Christ. The payment of 6000 ducados (for the paintings and retable) indicate a large commission. Small versions, probably models, exist for the three paintings more generally accepted as belonging to the retable, the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ.Probably originally on the right of the retable of the Colegio de Do&#241;a Mar�a, balancing the Adoration of the Shepherds, and painted at the same time. A small version, possibly the model for the large painting, is in the Galleria Corsini, Rome. A later development of this subject, only treated once before, in the Modena Triptych, is the painting for the Hospital de San Juan Bautista, Toledo, probably completed after his death by Jorge Manuel. The pose of the Christ is related to that of the Saint Sebastian of c. 1580. The bipartite composition can be related to the Burial of the Count of Orgaz, the portraits giving place to the range of angels. The splendid ecstatic figure of the angel, between the Baptist and Christ, is one of a number of such symbols that he began to introduce into his painting. If his figures - the actual participants in the action - become increasingly dematerialised, these new symbols appear as emotions materialised in gesture and colour

35488-25mythol.jpg	The story, depicted in the painting is part of the legendary history of Athens and it has echoes of a primitive fertility rite. It tells how Vulcan, in a clumsy attempt to ravish Minerva, accidentally let his semen spill over the ground, and Mother Earth, thus fertilized, gave birth to Erichthonius. Minerva shut the infant in a basket, which she entrusted to the three daughters of Cecrops, king of Attica, forbidding them to open it. But one of them, overcome by curiosity, did so and discovered that the child had a serpent's tail for legs (or that a serpent lay beside it). Maddened with terror the three threw themselves from the top of the Acropolis. Erichthonius, brought up by Minerva, became king of Athens.The three sisters are depicted in the act of opening the basket, out of which a snake uncurls itself. The infant lies inside. Mother Earth is represented by a statue of Diana of Ephesus, the many-breasted goddess of fertility. The theme is most often found in 17th century Netherlandish painting

08877-0view1.jpg	Most of the frescoes in the transept of the upper church of San Francesco, as well as in the apse, were executed all at once by Cimabue and his workshop. Cimabue, who came from Florence, is the first of the mural painters active in Assisi who can be identified by name. The subject matter of the extensive pictorial program that was executed under Cimabue's direction in the transept and the apse is based for the most part on the dedications of the altars in the western section of the church. A thirteenth-century inscription indicates that the altar in the south transept was dedicated to the archangel Michael; the high altar, to the birth of the Virgin; and the altar in the north transept, to the apostles or to Peter and Paul. Accordingly, the apse had scenes from the life of the Virgin, culminating in the Assumption; the south transept had motifs from the Apocalypse and a large Crucifixion on the east wall; the north transept arm had scenes from the lives of the apostles and another large Crucifixion; and the crossing vault had the evangelists.The scenes from the life of the Virgin in the apse of the Upper Church represent the first large program dedicated to Mary in the history of Italian painting. The paintings of the upper registers are almost entirely destroyed. The four large fields of the basamento to the left and right of the papal throne are dedicated to the death and glorification of the Virgin. The Assembly of the Apostles by the Virgin's Deathbed is followed by the Death of the Virgin and the Assumption. The final painting, shown here, represents the Virgin as intercessor, sitting on the heavenly throne alongside Christ. They are flanked by angels, patriarchs, prophets, saints, and Franciscans. To the left of the throne St Francis recommends brothers of his Order to the Virgin

12384-tobias.jpg	Karel Dujardin's classically styled biblical scenes, produced mostly in his Amsterdam period between 1659 and 1674, betray the influence of the schools of Rome and Bologna in general, and, on occasion, of Annibale Carracci in particular.

After his arduous life of wanderings, narrated by the paintings in the neighbouring church, Roch finally reaches heaven, its angelic choirs, and the supreme vision ""face to face.""The spirit of Michelangelo, who had only recently died, seems to permeate this ceiling picture. While the figure of God the Father is reminiscent of the Creator in the frescos of the Sistine Chapel, his encounter with the rising St Roch suggests Titian's famous Assunta, the epoch-making altarpiece of 1516/18 in the nearby Frari church, showing the Assumption of the Virgin. The muscular figure of the saint, patron of the victims of the plague, and the attractive representatives of the nine choirs of angels, slightly reminiscent of Gothic cathedral sculpture, seem to stand on the edge of an opening in the roof itself.

05414-italian.jpg	Jan Both was one of the best known of the Dutch painters living in Italy for varying length of time in the 17th century (the so-called Italianates). They painted landscapes without depicting a specific topography and almost all their works are imaginary compositions. Both's painting - although includes a draughtsman - is no exception. It shows a waterfall and a small gorge overgrown with bushes and trees close to a country road with a bridge which has just been crossed by a travelling party consisting of a carriage drawn by two horses led by grooms. By the side of the road are three groups of two figures each, all wearing rather rustic garbs.Judging by their poses and the sheet of paper held by one of them they are artists surveying the countryside.

But to the modern observer his own description of the picture, written shortly before it was ready for the 1825 Academy exhibition - 'calm &#38; exhilarating, fresh &#38; blowing' - applies more happily to the sketch; the greatest sufferer in the finished canvas is the sky, which has lost its bubbling clouds

11024-503david.jpg	David's first history painting in exile was an extremely original and disturbing interpretation of the late antique myth of Cupid and Psyche. It was painted for the wealthy Italian patron and connoisseur Count Giovanni Battista Sommariva and, although planned in Paris, it was only finished in Brussels in 1817.As related by the Roman writer Lucius Apuleius in The Golden Ass (late second century AD), Cupid, the god of love, fell in love with the beautiful Psyche and brought her to his palace, where he visited her every night without ever letting her see his face. But curiosity got the better of her, and one night Psyche looked at Cupid while he was asleep. Unfortunately a drop of hot oil fell from her lamp and awakened him, whereupon he abandoned her and the palace disappeared. From then on Psyche was condemned to wander the earth and perform impossible tasks in the vain hope of winning her lover back.Many other artists saw the lovers as innocent, tender and poetic, but David deliberately drew attention to the sexual aspect of the relationship. Normally Cupid was shown as a beautiful young man, but David depicted him as a grinning adolescent who seems proud of his recent conquest. A great contrast is set up between Cupid's coarse ruddy features and awkward angular limbs, and the pale, smooth and languid beauty of the sleeping Psyche. Unusually for David, the colours are bright and intense; in Brussels he looked at the colours used by Flemish Renaissance artists such as Jan van Eyck.

28425-winter_l.jpg	Two out of three winters in Holland during the 17th century saw particularly extended periods of frosts and snow. During the 1660s the level of snowfall increased significantly and two of the harshest winters were in 1662-63 and 1671-72. Dutch artists, among them Jacob van Ruisdael and Klaes Molenaer produced many winter landscape in this period. Molenaer's winter scenes are characterised by a great interest in the harmony and balance between the figures and their surroundings, more akin to the work of the Haarlem painter of the previous generation, Isack van Ostade, than the atmospheric landscapes of Jacob van Ruisdael.The landscape elements in the present scene are broadly repeated in other works by Molenaer.

31268-adoratio.jpg	This panel presents a number of compositional and symbolic peculiarities: St Joseph is represented in the background, visible in the middle through the door of the hut, grazing the ox and the donkey, usually depicted next to the Infant Jesus; angels playing long flutes take the place of the shepherds and Magi; the white bird on the beam of the roof (a dove?), perhaps an allusion to the Holy Spirit that descended to Mary. The Virgin's usual blue cloak is adorned with the star of the Byzantine tradition and behind her hangs a humble saddle. The Infant St John has significantly handed the cross, symbol of the Passion, to the child, who, as was common in Tuscan painting, is lying on a sheet and a sack. The figure of the Madonna, like those of the angels, fits in perfectly with the curved edge of the panel, perhaps painted to celebrate a birth, as was customary at the time. Tradition and innovation are fused in this painting, of which there is another version in the Hermitage, considered by some the original and by others a replica of the tondo in the Galleria Borghese

08864-12peter.jpg	"The painting is from the church of Corpus Domini in Venice. It was commissioned by Benedetto Carloni in his woill of November 5, 1504. It is signed in Latin on the paper on the base: ""JOANIS BAPTISTA CIMA / CONEGLIAN(ENS)IS.""Cima must have been attracted at a very early age to Venice, where he was fascinated by the elder Bellini and Antonello da Messina. From them he acquired a pictorial repertory suited to his work on a provincial circuit, and like Montagna and Alvise Vivarini, he propagated their approach to painting on the mainland and in Emilia. His work, however, has richer colour and warmth, through the influence of Giorgione.This altarpiece shows Cima's typical mixture of the archaic and the modern. The impeccably harmonious fifteenth-century construction of architecture and figures is accompanied by a modern sunny atmosphere and a landscape steeped in luminous vapour. The traveling artist has evoked memories of his birthplace, setting it on the shores of a quiet lake and peopling it with shepherds, as in an Arcadian dream"

After the completion of the architecture of the high altar, i.e. soon after 1564, work started on the iconographically unconventional altarpiece under the influence of Tridentine reformist ideas. It omits the gruesome torture of the martyrdom, concentrating instead on the saint's moment of intercession. The central figure is incorporated in a group composition full of movement.

35717-ruined_c.jpg	Panoramic views of the flat plains in Holland are often said to be the most distinctive contribution of Dutch landscape painting. They differ from the 'world panorama' of earlier Flemish art by seemingly recording the momentary view of a single scene, rather than being composed of a collection of separate visual memories. Formally, they are characterized bb a low horizon line, implying a low viewpoint. Although Ruisdael, perhaps the greatest and the most versatile Dutch landscape specialist, did not invent this type of picture, he became one of its most distinguished practitioners.This painting may represent a view in Gooiland, a district to the east of Amsterdam; there are, however, at least four other, smaller landscapes by Ruisdael that show the same view or part of it with considerable variations, and it is clear that he was not attempting strict topographical accuracy. Despite the pretence of spontaneity, this work, like all landscape paintings of the time, is a synthetic product of the artist's studio.Its dominant feature is the sky, to which two thirds of the picture surface is devoted and which is also reflected in the water of the foreground. This is the real, moisture-laden sky of Holland billowing with clouds, the sun breaking sporadically through scattering shafts of light across the countryside - effects which Constable was later to emulate. Almost more remarkable than the truthful record of the shape, density and illumination of the clouds is the illusion that they are moving through space and over our heads (we tend to think that perspective does not govern cloudscapes, but these seem to taper towards the horizon and broaden at the upper edge of the painting). The long horizon too seems to extend beyond the frame, broken only by church spires and the tiny white sails of a windmill. But our sense of inhabiting the landscape is compromised by our viewpoint in relation to the foreground. By letting us look down into the bastion standing below the horizon line, the painter suggests that we are viewing it from some improbably high place, higher also than the shore on which the peasants graze their flock (both figures and animals were painted by Adriaen van der Velde, a division of labour quite common in Dutch landscapes). This implied detachment, however, strengthens the elegiac mood aroused by the sight of overgrown ruins, melancholy reminders of a distant and more heroic past

13403-15arnol.jpg	"""The Arnolfini Marriage"" is a name that has been given to this untitled double portrait by Jan van Eyck, now in the National Gallery, London. It is one of the greatest celebrations of human mutuality. Like Rembrandt's ""Jewish Bride"", this painting reveals to us the inner meaning of a true marriage. Giovanni Arnolfini, a prosperous Italian banker who had settled in Bruges, and his wife Giovanna Cenami, stand side by side in the bridal chamber, facing towards the viewer. The husband is holding out his wife's hand.Despite the restricted space, the painter has contrived to surround them with a host of symbols. To the left, the oranges placed on the low table and the windowsill are a reminder of an original innocence, of an age before sin. Unless, that is, they are not in fact oranges but apples (it is difficult to be certain), in which case they would represent the temptation of knowledge and the Fall. Above the couple's heads, the candle that has been left burning in broad daylight on one of the branches of an ornate copper chandelier can be interpreted as the nuptial flame, or as the eye of God. The small dog in the foreground is an emblem of fidelity and love. Meanwhile, the marriage bed with its bright red curtains evokes the physical act of love which, according to Christian doctrine, is an essential part of the perfect union of man and wife.Although all these different elements are highly charged with meaning, they are of secondary importance compared to the mirror, the focal point of the whole composition. It has often been noted that two tiny figures can be seen reflected in it, their image captured as they cross the threshold of the room. They are the painter himself and a young man, doubtless arriving to act as witnesses to the marriage. The essential point, however, is the fact that the convex mirror is able to absorb and reflect in a single image both the floor and the ceiling of the room, as well as the sky and the garden outside, both of which are otherwise barely visible through the side window. The mirror thus acts as a sort of hole in the texture of space. It sucks the entire visual world into itself, transforming it into a representation.The cubic space in which the Arnolfinis stand is itself a prefiguration of the techniques of perspective which were still to come. Van Eyck practised perspective on a purely heuristic basis, unaware of the laws by which it was governed. In this picture, he uses the mirror precisely in order to explode the limits of the space to which his technique gives him access as soon as it threatens to limit him"

20083-11hooch.jpg	This painting, also titled as A Merry Company with Two Men and Two Women, is one of the first genre pictures by De Hooch in which the figures rise above the level of soldiers visiting inns and in which the setting makes tentative claims to gentility. De Hooch took the ideas from Anthonie Palamedesz and Jacob van Velsen in Delft and from many painters in other cities. The Visit  represents the domestication of a social theme that had earlier been set mostly in taverns and bordellos. In slightly later years De Hooch would depict more luxurious rooms and superficially more polite behaviour than he did in this key work of his early maturity

10917-lamentat.jpg	This type of Piet&#224;, whether or not accompanied by other holy women, appears more than once in Gerard David's oeuvre and was adopted on various occasions by painters of his circle such as Adriaan Isenbrant or Ambrosius Benson. A model drawing may have existed in David's studio or perhaps there was another prototype by his hand which is now lost. On closer examination David seems here to have built on both Hugo van der Goes and Hans Memling.The composition of the scene is a kind of reprise of Memling's Reins triptych (Memlingmuseum, Bruges). Here too, the scene is set in front of a landscape with on the left buildings intended to represent Jerusalem and on the right a group of rocks which serves as a repoussoir. The tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, which he placed at Christ's disposal, has been hewn out of the rocks here. Wearing a turban and exotic clothing he stands in profile before the tombstone, while Nicodemus enters the tomb. With Memling it is a Roman sarcophagus which stands in front of the rock and which is being opened by Joseph and Nicodemus. The composition itself, with the body held almost upright under the armpits and the head nodding to one side, derives from the right wing of Hugo van der Goes' Lamentation diptych (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). The figure of the Virgin placed parallel along Christ's body with her arm diagonally across it is an adaptation in reverse of the Virgin's posture in Van der Goes. The same is probably also the case with the position of the squatting Mary Magdalene. The St John, with his right knee and foot in frontal view, is also borrowed from Memling's Reins triptych. The spire in the landscape is probably intended to suggest Bruges' Our Lady's Church

07663-carlev08.jpg	The painting affords a view of the Serenissima's most characteristic quay: the Molo, with the columns of San Marco and San Todaro (or Teodoro) framing the entrance to the city. On the left stands the Ducal Palace, rendered in minute detail. The steep perspective in which the building is captured continues into the background along the Riva degli Schiavoni. Cast in contrasting light and truncated by the upper border of the image, the column of San Todaro dominates the scene. Between it and the column of San Marco the mast of a schooner appears in the background; it marks the central axis of the composition. Together with the large schooner on the right, the column of San Todaro to some extent counterbalances the buildings which occupy the left side. There is much activity both on the water and in the Square, where most of the figures are gathered in small groups.This view of the Molo and the Ducal Palace towards the east is highly unusual. Instead of depicting the Palace frontally, Carlevaris turned a quarter circle so that we look down the fa�ade of the building towards the Riva degli Schiavoni, a composition he also used in four later works. The vantage-point in all these works is from the loggia of the Library, directly opposite the Ducal Palace.Although the architecture dominates the composition, the artist paid close attention to the human figures. Drawn or painted studies for several of the macchiette have survived. Scenes of people and situations drawn from everyday life were introduced to Italy in the first half of the seventeenth century by Dutch painters active in Rome. In the course of the century the so-called Bamboccianti cast such everyday scenes with growing frequency against a &#151; sometimes identifiable &#151; urban background. One of these painters was Johannes Lingelbach, whose work seems to have inspired Carlevaris's vedute. The Venetian artist is thought to have spent some time in Rome, where he could have become familiar with Lingelbach's work.Carlevaris's town views are also deeply rooted in the Venetian tradition of depicting historic or festive events. His View of the Molo with the Ducal Palace, however, does not document a procession, reception or other festivity; rather, it subordinates the human figures to a portrayal of one part of the city in meticulous, topographically correct detail from an unorthodox point of view

43965-2tripti1.jpg	"The Louvre Annunciation is the central panel of a triptych the wings of which are most probably not the work of Rogier. Its style is quite different from that of the Descent from the Cross and shows closer affinities to that of Jan Van Eyck. It even reproduces certain details familiar to us from the Arnolfini Marriage, including the red of the bed clothes and hangings and the carved copper chandelier. Instead of the famous convex mirror, the painting features a copper medallion glinting in the background. This is also a picture replete with symbols in typical Campin style: lily, ewer and basin for purifying water, representing the purity of the Virgin Mary; a phial traversed by a ray of light evoking the miraculous birth; an orange or ""Chinese apple"", fruit of the forbidden tree, reminding us of the necessity of Redemption; extinguished candles, awaiting the coming of the Light, i.e. the Word made flesh.The painting seems to have been designed to suit the Flemish taste for intimate domestic scenes, according to which painters were expected to portray religious themes in familiar bourgeois interiors. Yet, this does not derive from any concern for the minutiae of realist detail, but from properly theological reasons.The new religious tendency in Flanders at that time was the ""devotio moderna"". This doctrine urged the believer to meditate on Christ's humanity, by representing it to himself in the context of his present life. In Rogier's painting, the contemporary setting, underlined by the absence of haloes, is meant to draw the viewer in so that he effectively participates in the scene before him. This is why the angel Gabriel appears before Mary dressed in an immaculate alb and magnificent brocade cope, as if he had come to celebrate mass, rather than deliver a message"

35820-ferrybo.jpg	With far-reaching stylistic similarities in their monochromatic, tonal treatment of the subject, Salomon van Ruysdael's river landscapes and those of Jan van Goyen from the 1630s are almost indistinguishable. However, around 1645 the first-named artist discovered the pictorial possibilities of the tree motif in compositions, through the work of his much more famous nephew Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael, in which this element plays a key role. This gave his variations on the theme a new impulse, and between 1645 and 1655 he painted a series of peaceful, limpid views with which he reached the summit of his art. With the cautious expansion of his palette and the more self confident style typical of these years, his work is also much more distinctively his own.The compositional structure to which this landscape owes its attractiveness is of a bold simplicity. A quarter of the way up the picture the horizontal axis intersects a vertical axis provided by the dark silhouette of a group of trees rising up on the opposite river bank. This divides the picture into two zones, of almost identical size, but in formal contrast to each other. In the left half each individual motif, under a highly atmospheric sky, bathes in an aura of lightness and weightlessness, contrasting with the right half, where mass and volume are piled up in the form of a farmstead, overshadowed by the tree group. Within this constellation even the ferry in the left foreground, laden low with a four-in-hand and a large number of passengers, appears like a fallen leaf carried along effortlessly by the river, the connecting feature stretching through this landscape.Within Salomon van Ruysdael's work, catalogued by Wolfgang Stechow, this painting represents an exception from his otherwise typical use of diagonals in his compositions. But whenever in later works he returns to this traditional pattern, this Ferryboat appears to have been a key work for the discovery of new waterside motifs, providing the viewer with variety and entertainment during his visual walk along never-ending river banks

44680-tribuna.jpg	The painting has become one of the most celebrated images of eighteenth-century taste. Zoffany shows a group of connoisseurs and members of the nobility admiring works of art in the Tribuna, the principal room of the Uffizi in Florence, which was the most famous gallery in the world during the eighteenth century. The Tribuna had been built by Francesco de' Medici in 1585-9 to a design by Bernardo Buontalenti as a showcase for the most precious items in the Medici collection. Although Zoffany has depicted the architectural features of the Tribuna with a fair degree of accuracy, he has rearranged the works of art and in some cases altered their scale. In fact, he has also incorporated a number of paintings from that part of the Medici collection housed in the Palazzo Pitti, as well as including several additional pieces of sculpture. The painter thus successfully gives the gallery a more crowded and undoubtedly richer appearance than it had during the eighteenth century, and by this means has facilitated his rendering of the complicated sightlines of the room and the perspectival inlaid marble decoration of the floor. The setting is therefore somewhat idealised, but it remains a perfectly accurate representation of the significance of the Tribuna for eighteenth-century connoisseurship, with its emphasis on the antique, the High Renaissance, the Bolognese school and Rubens.Zoffany painted the picture in Florence expressly for Queen Charlotte, beginning in 1772. Much of the composition was completed the following year, but the artist continued working on it intermittently until late in 1777, making changes some of which are now only visible by X-ray. Notable among these changes is the inclusion of a self portrait on the left of the composition, where the artist has shown himself peering round the unframed canvas of the Virgin and Child by Raphael. For this purpose, it is almost as if the painter has abandoned his easel, partly visible in the lower right corner of the picture, and walked across or around the back of the room to partake in the discussion. The figures in the picture, all of whom are identifiable, fall into three groups: those on the left between the sculptures of Cupid and Psyche and Satyr with the Cymbals; those in the foreground, right of centre, gathered around the Venus d'Urbino by Titian; and those on the right around the Venus de' Medici. These portraits were meticulously painted by Zoffany and won widespread admiration, although apparently not from George III and Queen Charlotte, who claimed that such recognisable figures were inappropriate to the scene. In essence, however, Zoffany has amalgamated the traditional subject of a gallery view, much exploited by Flemish painters in the seventeenth century, with the conversation piece evolved by British painters during the eighteenth century, although recently other more cryptic levels of meaning have been sought in the picture.Royal patronage enabled the artist to have the Venus d'Urbino by Titian taken down from the wall for copying after the Grand Duke of Tuscany (Ferdinando I) had specifically decreed that the picture had been copied too much and should not be moved again for such a purpose.Correspondingly, there are one or two references in the picture to the Royal Collection: the Virgin and Child by Raphael, held by the artist, was a work that was offered to George III by Earl Cowper (this is the Niccolini-Cowper Madonna, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington) and the Samian Sibyl by Guercino, seen at the lower edge of the composition, is a pendant to the Libyan Sibyl by the same artist bought by George III in the 1760s.The Tribuna of the Uffizi is a technical tour de force. The attention to detail and texture involves not just the portraits, but also the copies after the works of art nearly all of which are identifiable. Controlled brushwork and careful application are the hallmarks of Zoffany's style, and they are seen at their best in this famous picture without any of the loss of verve that such a long and elaborate undertaking might have forced upon the artist.

33455-19oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 521.The story of David and Bathsheba is in the Bible (II Sam. 11 :2-17). One evening while he walked on the roof of his palace David saw below him a beautiful woman bathing. This was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite who was then away on service in David's army. In an act of seignorial arrogance he had her brought to the palace and made love to her. She became pregnant as a consequence. Later he wrote to Uriah's army commander saying, 'Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle . . . that he may be smitten and die.' This indeed came about and David afterwards married Bathsheba. The child survived only a few days. David subsequently did penance.Bathsheba is usually depicted at her toilet in various states of nudity. Earlier Renaissance artists show her clothed and merely washing her hands or feet, helped by attendants. Sometimes a messenger is shown arriving with a letter, though the Bible does not record this detail. David's morally indefensible conduct did not deter the medieval Church from drawing a typological parallel: he prefigured Christ and Bathsheba the Church.Rembrandt's painting shows Bathsheba as she receives the message of King David summoning her. The sculpture-like position of the woman is inspired by antique reliefs

39243-02creati.jpg	One of the major achievements of Tintoretto's early works is the series of canvases painted in about 1550 for the Sala dell'Albergo of the Scuola della Santissima Trinit�. And of these the Creation of the animals is certainly unique for the swirling rhythm of the composition. In a blaze of golden light, which does not entirely escape the darkness still partly enveloping the newly created earth God the Father is portrayed as if suspended in mid-air in the act of creation. The animals rush forward from behind him while the birds shoot across the sky and the fishes dart through the water like arrows from his hand. The dramatic wind-swept scene is furrowed by the profiles of the animals which cross the canvas in running lines, conveying with extraordinary concision and expressiveness the theme of the work.Like Pietro Aretino's novel on the subject of Genesis, Tintoretto's painting shows the unicorn (right). The alleged curative and decontaminating qualities of the narwhal tusk, an essential item in every Renaissance cabinet of curiosities, were regarded as proof of the existence of this fabulous creature. Exotic creatures like the ostrich walking on the shore were much admired as gifts from guests to the princely courts of northern Italy, and were portrayed in drawings or engravings. As a true Venetian, however, Tintoretto here devotes particular artistic skill to the fishes, including sturgeon, salmon and red mullet.Tintoretto's model for this composition was Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne (National Gallery, London); he adopted the flying divine figure as well as the setting.

35698-water_m.jpg	Besides the Bentheim Castle, another motif Ruisdael discovered on his trip to the Dutch-German border region was the water mill. The half-timbered overshot and undershot mills he favoured were found in the eastern provinces of the Netherlands and in the area near Bentheim. Of course, earlier artists included watermills in their pictures but he was the first to make them the principal theme of a painting. The subject became one of the specialities of his pupil Meindert Hobbema, and today, when we think of them, his paintings not Ruisdael's come to mind. But in judging their respective accomplishments it is helpful to recall that Ruisdael painted powerful ones, such as Two Water Mills and an Open Sluice, which impresses by the cohesion of its forms and clear daylight effect, before Hobbema held a brush in his hand

44046-1diptych.jpg	The two small panels, representing the Madonna and St Catherine of Alexandria, respectively, probably formed a diptych.The busts of prophets on the outside of the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck were the model for the bust of God the Father at the top of the left panel.

The picture is usually regarded as an early work by Rogier himself from the years 1432-35, but the figure of the Madonna is probably after Jan van Eyck's Madonna of the Fountain, dated 1439, in Antwerp.The right panel is rather weaker, and is not by the same painter as the Madonna. As a king's daughter, Catherine has a crown, but she has taken it off, perhaps a sign of humility and reverence before the Madonna, and has placed it on the ground to lie there ignored.

19686-westerke.jpg	The works of Jan van der Heyden, one of the finest city-view specialists, are responsible for our general impressions of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. In paintings such as his View of the Westerkerk he presented a pristine, sunny image of the city in the 1670s. These cityscapes, many of which inventively recombine actual and fictional buildings, are as interesting for their omissions as for their inclusions. Both serious and comic descriptions of Amsterdam called attention to the busy traffic of people and carts, to the crying children and fighting street dwellers, to dirt and to crime, but van der Heyden's city views edit out congestion, noise, transgression, and dust, and gloss over class distinctions. They thereby present a salutary image of a unified, prosperous city, a beautifully painted fiction affordable only to its prosperous elite.Van der Heyden's painting takes as its centerpiece the Westerkerk, a church designed in 1620 by Hendrick de Keyser, then the city's most famous architect. Although the structure owed much to earlier Netherlandish designs executed in warmly coloured local brick, its details are innovative. To contemporaries the bell tower, completed in 1638, must have looked cosmopolitan with its three levels of classical columns in stone, topped by brackets that support a fanciful bulb. As the largest Protestant church built up to that time, it constituted a local answer to the magnificent tradition of Catholic building.Although de Keyser's church primarily served the Jordaan, a modest neighbourhood, van der Heyden represented it as seen from the stately Keizersgracht, the new Emperor's Canal

03766-031madon.jpg	"Of all the still youthful Madonnas by Bellini the masterpiece is the so called Greek Madonna of the Brera Gallery in Milan, which entered the Museum in 1808 following the Napoleonic repression. It was originally in the Ducal Palace in Venice. According to some sources the figures were originally set against a gold background, on which the words ""Mother of God"" and ""Christ"" were written in Greek (hence the name of the painting). Obviously, a background of this type would have made it archaic and ""archaizing"", considerably accentuating the Byzantine appearance of the panel, a veritable Marian icon. The 1986 restoration has established that the still remaining traces of gold beside the Greek letters were a 16th-century addition, while Bellini had originally conceived the sky as it appears now: blue and almost entirely covered by a small curtain held up by a cord. Over the traditional preparatory ground (gypsum and animal glue) he had sketched out the preliminary drawing, marking in with extreme precision even the chiaroscuro with subtle and highly regular criss-cross strokes which can be seen in infra-red photography. This technique used by Bellini must have been famous if Paolo Pino in his Dialogo di pittura (1548) writes that ""drawing the painting with such extreme diligence, composing it with chiaro and scuro as Giovanni Bellino was wont to do"" was to be discouraged ""for it is work thrown away since everything must be covered with the colours"".This type of drawing shows similarities with the rigorous Flemish constructive technique, though under closer scrutiny it appears to be aimed at a search for a much more solid and volumetrically constructed plastic quality. The delicate imperturbability of the Madonna, which would always remain a distinctive feature of Bellini's Virgins, shows not only its aforementioned Byzantine-iconic roots, but also how much the artist's culture owes to this heritage"

38722-unequal.jpg	This painting, which was altered by the artist and later cropped at the corners, depicts an almost claustrophobic interior, featuring a bare-chested prostitute clutching the fur garment of a man wearing a mask and pince-nez, both of which make him appear much older than he actually is.

09530-selfport.jpg	Occasionally a painting contains extra information, about the scene itself, for example, or about the artist. This self-portrait by the Amsterdam painter Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen tells us important facts about his life. The note with the date 1533 and the house mark between an I and an A appear to announce that Iacobus Amstelodamensis, or Jacob of Amsterdam, painted this portrait of himself in 1533. It is known from the archives that Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen, the person behind the name Jacob of Amsterdam, must have died before 18 October 1533, the date of a document stating that his wife was a widow. That and the date on the Self-Portrait appear to be conclusive evidence that the artist did indeed die that year.However, it has been suggested that he was dead by 1532, when one of his houses was sold. So 1533 or 1532 - it is not known for sure. On top of that, there are doubts about when the Self-portrait was actually executed. It is very close in style to the paintings that Jacob Cornelisz made around 1525, and he is not known to have made any more after 1526. It is possible that the date was added later, in the year of his death, and that we are looking at a Van Oostsanen who is younger than he appeared in 1533.There is another panel in which the same man is seated before an easel, painting the portrait of an older woman. It is by Dirck Jacobsz, the couple's son, who traced the head in the Rijksmuseum Self-Portrait and used it for the man by the easel. He then added his mother's likeness, creating an anachronistic scene: a portrait of his father as he probably looked before 1533, and one of his mother as she appeared around 1550

07264-canal714.jpg	The Royal Hospital at Greenwich was completed in 1752, over half a century after it was begun. Canaletto painted this depiction of it soon afterwards. It shows the view, which has altered little, through the centre of the hospital complex to the Queen's House, and on towards the Royal Observatory at the top of the hill beyond.Canaletto has created a slightly 'wide angle' effect by combining what can be seen of the hospital from two separate viewpoints which are set a little way apart on the near side of the Thames. He has slightly broken the potential symmetry of the composition by studying the buildings from a little left of centre. In addition, the monotony of the river is relieved by the considerable variety of craft that is travelling up and down it, and also by the unrelenting verticals and horizontals of the design which are countered by the bold diagonal of the mast of the ship grounded at the right.The river and architecture were established first by the artist, and the boats then painted over the top; it is just possible to see the buildings through the sails of the boat to the left of the centre of the picture

28483-winter_l.jpg	Momper is rightly regarded as the most important Flemish landscape painter between Pieter Brueghel and Rubens. Brueghel's influence is clearly evident in this winter landscape, and it is quite probable that his son Jan also painted a number of the figures in this picture.Momper's personal achievement lies in his rendering of landscape as a picturesque subject matter in its own right. What we see here is no longer a great universal landscape full of symbolically charged allusions, but a scene whose aesthetic appeal is valued for its own sake. Momper's painting is divided into various planes by a kind of backdrop, against which silhouettes are highlighted by a pale light or dark, thundery clouds. People are making their way along tortuous paths on terrain that seems to be hazardous.Rain-laden stormclouds, sunshine and snow set the atmosphere of the painting. In this respect, Momper has taken an important step towards emancipating the landscape painting as an autonomous genre in which the landscape is not merely a setting for some event, but is treated as a subject matter in its own right

24243-view2.jpg	The painting represents a capriccio of an imagined cityscape with Saint Mark's Basilica and ruins on the banks of a river. This imagined riverside town is typical of the spirited and picturesque landscapes created early in the career of Michele Marieschi. The artist includes celebrated and instantly recognizable edifices, such as Venice's Saint Mark's Basilica here, and places them side by side with fantasy buildings and crumbling ruins.  The artist is not bound by rules of perspective: the ruined columns and the tower overgrown with greenery are painted to a completely different scale than the houses directly opposite them on the other side of the river at right. They dwarf the figures beneath them, who cross the bridge between the two sides

Although fictive openings in ceilings and vaults had already been created in painting in the sixteenth century, permitting vivid views of events taking place in heaven, the heavenly visions of the seventeenth century take on a new quality, scale, and intensity. The supreme example is the ceiling composition executed by Baciccio (Giovanni Battista Gaulli) in Il Ges&#249;, the most spectacular of a fresco program encompassing virtually the entire church that Baciccio worked on for thirteen years (1672-85). In earlier examples the architecture served as the framing for the pictures, in Il Ges&#249; the relationship between architecture and painting was redefined: painting and decoration are confined to those portions of the church structure of greatest symbolic importance

36075-5window.jpg	Vasari points out that Salviati, in addition to his   work on the narrative frescoes, also executed some of the decorative details - the window framing between his two scenes, but also the illusionistic window to the right of the Birth of St John the Baptist scene. These window framings, with their nude youths atop festoons of fruit, are primarily decorative displays of artistic virtuosity; at the same time they contain elements - for example the tondo with the chiaroscuro depiction of Time revealing Truth - that can likewise easily be seen as referring to the theological content of the frescoes as well as to the work of the confraternity

39286-1mark.jpg	The painting is the first of a series of works, painted in 1548 for the Scuola Grande di San Marco while Marco Episcopi, his future father-in-law was Grand Guardian of the School.The subject of the huge canvas is the miraculous appearence of St Mark to rescue one of his devotees, a servant of a knight of Provence, who had been condemned to having his legs broken and his eyes put out for worshipping the relics of the saint against his master's will. The scenes takes place on a kind of proscenium which seems to force the action out of the painting towards the spectator who is thus involved in the amazement of the crowd standing in a semi-circle around the protagonists: the fore-shortened figure of the slave lying on the ground, the dumbfounded executioner holding aloft the broken implements of torture, the knight of Provence starting up from his seat out of the shadow into the light, while the figure of St Mark swoops down from above.In keeping with the drama of the action is the tight construction of the painting, the dramatic fore-shortening of the forms and sudden strong contrast of light and shade

The scene, set on some stony field, is grim. The dark, impenetrable background draws the spectator's gaze back again to the sharply illuminated figures who remind us, through the banal ugliness of their actions and movements - note the yellow rear and filthy feet of the lower figure - that the death of the apostle was not a heroic drama, but a wretched and humiliating execution

26062-17rein.jpg	This small triptych is the second altarpiece to be commissioned from Memling by a brother at St John's Hospital in Bruges, the first being the Floreins triptych. The donor has been identified as Adriaan Reins on the basis of the initials AR on the frame and the figure of St Adrian who protects him in the left wing. Reins was received into the Order in 1479, and died in 1490.The principal scene is a Lamentation on Golgotha beneath a glowering evening sky. The left wing represents the donor with his patron saint, while the right wing features St Barbara, the hospital saint par excellence.The composition is a development on an idea of Rogier van der Weyden, who was the first to reduce the Lamentation to its three principal protagonists (apart from Christ) in a number of smaller compositions. The body with its stiff, open arms and closed legs, knelt over by the praying Virgin, first appears in another work by the same master, namely the Lamentation in The Hague (Mauritshuis). The scene as a whole is portrayed in deep and sombre tones. The predominance of purple - including the marbling of the frame - means that the altarpiece is literally enveloped in the colour of the Passion.Two versions of this Lamentation are known: the central panel of the Kaufmann triptych in Rotterdam and the Rome Lamentation, both of which were probably painted at an earlier date. The former in particular may be seen as the immediate compositional predecessor of the Reins triptych.Doubts as to the authorship of the work were expressed from an early stage, probably because the figures of St John and Mary Magdalene did not meet the idealised Memling image that had been formed by the nineteenth century, and because of the lack of an inscription with the artist's signature. Despite these doubts, this little triptych is a masterpiece, executed with the utmost delicacy.The central panel was partially copied (landscape, Christ and St John) in the Santa Barbara Lamentation by a follower of Memling from the late fifteenth century

12113-children.jpg	Although Drouais made his career primarily as a society portrait painter in the tradition of Largilli�re and Nattier, his portraits 'd�guis�s' were very different from theirs. Instead of court ladies depicted in the guise of antique goddesses, Drouais chose to depict his ladies and gentlemen (and especially their children) in pastoral guises (say, of shepherds and shepherdesses) or as members of different, perhaps less fortunate classes such as harvest workers or Savoyards. The present portrait depicts the two sons of the Duc de Bouillon dressed as Montagnards. One holds a marmot with a ribbon and the other plays a hurdy-gurdy, both activities associated exclusively with the people of the mountains especially in Savoy and in North Italy.The painting is signed lower centre: Drouais le fils 1756

08420-figures.jpg	"A 1692 Chigi inventory lists two paintings, the Rural Scene (see at Angeluccio) and the Figures in a Tree-lined Avenue and indicates that they are the product of a collaboration between Angeluccio, who painted the landscape, and Michelangelo Cerquozzi, who painted the figures.Though Miel and van Bloemen also painted figures for Angeluccio's landscapes, the majority of his collaborations were with Michelangelo Cerquozzi.

Her left hand holds the symbol of faith, the Cross, that has played so great a part in Italy's history. Her naked breast is highly provocative when seen with the black cross of mourning. She is perhaps the allegory of Italy in the 19th century, and the gaze with which this figure of ""Italia"" confronts the viewer creates a suggestive, almost hypnotic effect.

35473-11mythol.jpg	Venus and her son Cupid are being offered food and wine by Ceres, goddess of the fruits of the field, and Bacchus, god of wine. The subject comes from a line by the Roman comic poet Terence (d. 159 BC) which frequently figures in the emblem literature that developed from the mid-16th century: 'Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus' - without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus would freeze. Love is impossible without food and drink. Rather than depicting a boisterous feast, Rubens has opted for a rather restrained scene that must be read as a plea for moderation in pleasure.Rubens produced this painting a few years after his eight-year stay in Italy, where he was employed at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga of Mantua, and also in Rome. The knowledge of antiquity he gained then was put to use in this painting, as also in a later work on the same theme in 1614, (Royal Fine Arts Museum, Antwerp), Ceres' pose being taken from the Crouching Venus of the Hellenistic sculptor Doidalsas, dating from around 240-230 BC. Rubens certainly knew the marble copy in the Farnese collection in Rome (today in the National Archaeological Museum, Naples).What he particularly appreciated in Hellenistic and Roman sculpture was its formal dynamism, although he saw in ancient sculpture generally a realm of flawless, ideal nature. In painting from such antique models, he says in his De Imitatione Statuarum, a treatise 'on the imitation of sculpture', the statuary has to be humanised, translated into flesh and blood.

24925-metropo2.jpg	This double-sided panel shows on one side the martyrdom of St Lawrence and on the other a woman offering drink to a bedridden man. The work is a fragment of an altarpiece shutter, in which the St Lawrence scene on gold ground would have been oriented to the interior, visible in the altarpiece's open state.Three other double-sided panels were recognized as part of the same altarpiece. These panels also depict acts of mercy on the exterior, namely Beheading of John the Baptist (interior) and Providing Shelter to Strangers (exterior) and Feast of Herod (interior) and Feeding the Hungry (exterior), both panels in the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift, Trier, as well as St Lawrence before the Emperor (interior) and Clothing the Naked (exterior) in a private collection. The dismantled altarpiece was attributed to an unknown master in Salzburg named after this ensemble as Master of the Acts of Mercy.A plausible reconstruction assumes a total of six acts of mercy, and arranges the wing scenes in two tall columns, displaying the Acts of Mercy in the closed state, and three scenes each from the lives of St John the Baptist and St Lawrence in the open state. It is suggested that two missing acts, tending the sick and visiting the imprisoned were shown at the top of the wings. The centre of the altarpiece was probably a painted or a sculpted shrine

17065-paris15.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 313, JH 1251.This picture shows an inviting restaurant in Asni�res. Van Gogh's unique facility for communicating his feelings directly by means of his brushwork is already in evidence. The light and the associated atmospheric effects have become the actual subject of the picture, very much in the spirit of the Impressionists. Although still restrained, the painting is defined in terms of colour by contrasting complementary colours: blue and orange, red and green.By the middle of 1887 a dramatic change of style has occurred in van Gogh's work. Using these characteristically 'impressionist' motifs of a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris, van Gogh seems to have been willing to experiment with Impressionist techniques as well. However, the painting lacks a sense of substance and conviction, which reflects his difficulty in feeling himself as part of the world he is portraying.In the two years van Gogh spent in Paris he tried to assimilate French Impressionism, only to find that a new generation of painters were questioning its premises regarding both subject-matter and style. His flirtation with Impressionist subject-matter was brief; encounters with the Neo-Impressionists led him to believe that Paris could no longer be the subject of modern French painting

35316-sketch1.jpg	This painting is an oil sketch (modello) for the principal altarpiece in the east transept of the Kollegienkirche in Salzburg, built by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723) between 1696 and 1707. This altarpiece is one of the most important works from Rottmayr's later period. The modello is a smaller version of the six-meter high altarpiece and reproduces the elongation and distortion of the figures which create the perspective of the altarpiece itself.St Charles Borromeo was the intercessor for people stricken with the plague. In response to an outbreak of the plague epidemic in the city of Salzburg, processions are held and Holy Communion is administered following the example of St Charles Borromeo. Rottmayr defined the location of the event by depicting recognisable features of the Salzburg landscape and architecture.Rottmayr's style of painting was shaped by and bears the imprint of his schooling in the Italian, and above all Venetian, art of painting in the sixteenth century

24307-10marko.jpg	Mark� often interrupted his stay in Italy for the sake of paying a visit to Hungary. This work, made in 1853, is considered a rarity, because, except for a few works during the earliest period of his career, he never painted Hungarian landscapes. Although his art can largely be classified as late neo-classicist, this time Mark� chose a romantic motif. He depicted the Puszta, the region of the country which is still thought to be the most special and the most interesting, with a sweep-pole well, its mandatory symbol. A rainbow glows in the stormy sky. One is reminded of the anxiety felt before a storm by the ponderous, dark clouds. Besides the subject of the painting, its style also shows the traits of romanticism, with special regards to its composition which is built on the contrast between light and dark.

14015-1zenob01.jpg	The Villa Zenobio in Santa Bona Nuova, near Treviso, was built between 1673 and 1689 and was profoundly reworked during the mid-eighteenth century when the garden wing was erected. The small entrance portego was decorated in the early years of the eighteenth century by Gregorio Lazzarini. In 1744, the villa was acquired by Sebastiano Uccelli (1695-1768) who can be credited with the renovation of the villa. He commissioned Francesco Fontebasso to paint frescoes in the ballroom of the new garden wing.Frescoes unfold across the ceiling and walls of the vast ballroom, as well as beneath the open gallery. The ceiling fresco depicts The Magnanimity of Scipio, while the wall frescoes focus on the narration of episodes from the life of Queen Zenobia and represent The Banquet of Zenobia and Triumph of Aureliano. However, the interpretation of these scenes is debated

40266-organ_2.jpg	In 1469 the cover of the organ of the Cathedral in Ferrara was painted by Tura. The Annunciation was visible in the closed state of the organ, while in the open state the panel representing St George and the Dragon was shown. The cover of the organ was transferred to the Museum in 1735.The organ frontal for the Cathedral must serve as an introduction to the painter, although he was about thirty-nine years old when it was finished and obviously a fully formed painter. The shutters were painted with tempera, although Tura seems frequently to have employed oils as well. They are emotionally charged, full of movement and intense expressionism. In the St George the frightened princess, placed close to the picture plane, moves swiftly to the left of the single canvas she occupies. Her fluttering, irregular draperies with decisive hills and valleys are carefully studied, but they do not follow the structure of her body or even her pose, becoming instead alive and rebelliously independent of the forms they hide.Light is effectively rendered as an expressive device without becoming a particularly naturalistic component, striking here and there, helter-skelter, although a certain concentration on the left may be isolated. Highlights are also found on the right-hand edges of forms, especially in the canvas showing St George impaling the dragon. Color is equally antinaturalistic. The tight-fitting leather costume of the saint is outlined, pale maroon against a golden sky. His gray horse, ferociously participating in the confrontation, is accentuated by a calligraphic arrangement of thin red straps. There are strong echoes of Mantegna, perhaps in part filtered through Squarcione, in motives like the rendering of the winding trail with figures on the hill behind the princess and a tight application of paint, which permits abundant minuscule detail. Critics have called attention to connections with later Donatello, especially with his reliefs made for nearby Padua. These are difficult to isolate within the personal expressive idiom of the St George, except for the shared intensity in treating sacred figures and narratives

12298-21badia.jpg	Painted with the 'Master of the Badia at Isola'. With regard to this anonymous master it is worth recording that in all probability he was at the beginning in such close relations with Duccio as to lend credibility to the opinion that Duccio's hand can be detected in some of his early works. As an example can be cited the very beautiful Madonna no. 593 in the Pinacoteca of Siena whose face is really so close to Duccio's Crevole Madonna that it could easily be attributed to him and dated to that period

25276-05educat.jpg	The Golden Legend, drawing on the apocryphal gospels, tells how the Virgin Mary was brought up as a child in the Temple at Jerusalem 'with other virgins'...and was visited daily of angels', since it had been foretold to her parents, Joachim and Anne, that their daughter was to be consecrated to the Lord as the 'chosen vessel' of Christ's Incarnation. The theme became popular in the 16th century and remained so after the Counter-Reformation in spite of some disapproval by the Church because of its apocryphal character. Mary is seen in earlier examples teaching her young companions, sewing the priest vestments or being ministered to by angels who bring bread and water. But the favourite theme, especially in Counter-Reformation art, depicts her education in the strict sense, at the knee of her mother Anne, learning to read.You can view other depictions of the Education of the Virgin in the Web Gallery of Art

08797-eligius.jpg	St Eligius, who was born c. 590 in Limousin, notably in the making of reliquaries has become one of the most popular saints of the Christian West. Ancient tradition credits him with extraordinary talent as a goldsmith.St Eligius in His Workshop remains to this day the best-known and best-loved painting of Petrus Christus. It shows two young fianc�s who have brought the patron saint of goldsmiths a quantity of precious metal to be melted down and fashioned into rings as token of their love. Christus gives us an extremely detailed representation of the goldsmith's shop. Not only are there all the instruments of the trade, but also many liturgical objects, carefully arranged on shelves. There is also a convex circular mirror on the right-hand side of St Eligius's table, in an obvious allusion to the Arnolfini Marriage by Jan van Eyk. In it we can see the reflection of a square, with a couple of passers-by. Although the presence of the saint gives the work a religious dimension, this remains essentially a genre painting: that is, a representation of secular and commercial activities, a scene from everyday life

24095-4judith.jpg	Once owned by King Charles I of England, this painting illustrates an episode from the Old Testament which relates how the Israelite Judith by guile killed the Assyrian general Holofernes and thus saved her beleaguered city. Painted with minute detail, Judith and her handmaiden finish their deed with tragic calm.Among Mantegna's works there are several representations of Judith that, without exception, show a comparatively peaceful scene in which Judith is placing the severed head of Holofernes in a bag. During the Baroque, in contrast, the dramatic central moment of the action was preferred, as Judith, often with great effort, decapitates Holofernes.

These were done in pastel and in them she explored the finest shadings of her subjects' characters, the most fleeting of their moods. Thus, without falling either into the dangers of the encomiastic portrait or of the documentary, Rosalba matches the immediacy of pastel technique to the freshness of her psychological and social penetration of her subjects, offering an unrivalled picture of the society of her time. In the Elderly Lady the mature beauty of the noblewoman and her serene good-natured existence are conveyed with incomparable skill. No less typical of her work is the portrait of Cardinal Melchior de Polignac with its superb rendering of the physical features of the subject, catching immediately the wilful character of the prelate.The artist uses her pastels with consummate skill in conveying the fresh innocence of the Young Lady of the Le Blond Family

14509-burning.jpg	This work of Froment's maturity, which is indeed an epitome of his whole oeuvre, was commissioned by King Ren� of Provence. This central panel of the triptych represents Moses before the Burning Bush; the figures kneeling in prayer on the wing are the donor and his wife, Jeanne de Laval, accompanied by saints (not reproduced here). In this work the painter has abandoned the occasional crudities of The Raising of Lazarus; only in the countenance of Moses are there reminiscences of the more rigid portraiture of the earlier altarpiece. Moses is struck with astonishment at the vision before him and the appearance of the angel. The vision occupies the upper centre of the picture: amidst a great circle of flaming rose bushes the Madonna appears in a richly draped mantle, holding the Child. Christ holds a mirror in his hand, in which both of them are reflected. The picture contains a number of emblematical representations. The combination of a number of unusual elements side by side is characteristic of mediaeval symbolism. It is evidence of the extraordinary cult of the Virgin in the Middle Ages that it is she who appears before Moses, and not God, as in the Old Testament

40348-01prato.jpg	Those sections of the fresco cycle that are attributed to Paolo in the Chapel of Our Lady of the Assumption in Prato Cathedral display a perfect compositional organization, created through a precise perspective pattern that places the simple, elegant buildings and the numerous human figures within a perfectly balanced spatial rhythm. Each of the characters has a different expression, evidence of a research into facial characteristics which will later become typical of Uccello's painting.In the scene of the Disputation of St Stephen, for instance, the beautiful face of the saint and those of the characters standing around him are portrayed with strongly marked expressions, in some cases even grotesque, in the attempt at giving each one individual characteristics. Behind this group of figures there is an architectural construction that is reminiscent of Brunelleschi's buildings. The accuracy and the perfect perspective of the drawing of this building is repeated also in the constructions in the background of the Stoning of St Stephen, for this reason correctly attributed to Uccello; the scene of Stephen's martyrdom, on the other hand, is the work of Andrea di Giusto

24384-pandemon.jpg	"In the 1820s Martin produced a series of paintings depicting scenes of disaster, set in infinite, visionary spaces and full of theatrical, nightmarish lighting effects. Their basic mood largely derived from the artist's familiarity with John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost and with the biblical Apocalypse.The Pandemonium of 1841 goes back to a passage in the first book of Milton's Paradise Lost, in which ""Pandemonium, the palace of Satan, rises suddenly built out of the deep."" In a diagonal perspective characteristic of Martin, a gigantic building complex extends along the waterfront. This recalls fantastic reconstructions of cities of antiquity. Martin's Satan, whose invocatory figure stands on a rocky outcrop in the right foreground, has the look of an ancient Greek hero. Like Achilles outside Troy, he appears with shield and feathered helmet, but commanding an army not of besiegers but of demons and damned souls in their Cyclopean city"

(Apostles 8, v. 60). Around him are the stones which have bloodied his face; two more bounce off the back of his head; one of his executioners raises another one high, about to strike again, and holds more in his robe.

07998-magnani.jpg	"This scene is part of the frescoed frieze painted in 1588-91 by the Carracci in the salone on the piano nobile of the Palazzo Magnani in Bologna. The frieze depicts in 15 scenes the stories of the founding of Rome. The iconographical program of the frieze precisely follows the story of ""Parallel Lives"" by Plutarch. Each scene is accompanied by a motto written on a scroll beneath each box.One of the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. The twin brothers were purported to be sons of the Rhea Silvia and Mars, the god of war. Because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their murderous uncle, they were abandoned at birth and put into a basket that was then placed into the River Tiber. The basket ran aground and the twins were discovered by a female wolf. The wolf nursed the babies for a short time before they were found by a shepherd. The shepherd then brought up the twins.When Romulus and Remus became adults, they decided to found a city where the wolf had found them. The brothers quarrelled over where the site should be and Remus was killed by his brother. This left Romulus the sole founder of the new city and he gave his name to it &#150; Rome. The date given for the founding of Rome is 753 BC.Romulus and Remus Suckled by the Wolf is the first scene of the cycle. It was executed by Lodovico Carracci. The motto beneath the scene reads: ""LAESI NON NECATI ALIMVR"" (Wounded, not killed, we are fed)"

25095-ursula.jpg	The present panel can be considered among the finest examples of the Master's works. It can be seen as a continuation of the great influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on artists not only in his adopted city of Brussels, but throughout the whole of the Low Countries.Ursula was the daughter of the Christian King Dionotus of Dumnonia. At her father's insistence she agreed to marry the pagan Conan Meriadoc of Armorica, but not before a religious pilgrimage to Rome, circa 383, so that her suitor could be baptized. Upon their return from Rome, the couple stopped in Cologne, where they, along with her eleven thousand virgin attendants, were intercepted by the Huns, then in control of the German city. The pagan Hunnish prince asked Ursula to be his bride, but he was rejected. As retribution, Ursula was put to death by arrows, along with her attendants, all of whom were beheaded. Here the Master of the Legend of St. Barbara depicts St. Ursula punctured by a single arrow, her identifying symbol, as she protects her attendants with her finely rendered robe

05871-chiswic1.jpg	Lord Burlington created the most complex example of Palladian architecture. Chiswick House, built between 1723 and 1729, is close to the villas of the Veneto in Italy. The ground plan, a square containing a central octagon, recalls Palladio's Villa Rotonda. A suite of interconnecting geometric spaces surround the domed central hall; they extend into apses with statues in the niches.The exterior combines multiple references to antiquity. The six Corinthian columns of the portico are from the temple of Jupiter Stator in Rome, the semi-circular, subdivided windows of the drum are reminiscent of Roman thermal baths. These features do not represent a literal quotation from ancient buildings but rather a version of the sixteenth-century interpretations which were accessible to Burlington through Palladio's drawings and buildings

00879-40west.jpg	Sixtus II (257-258) had charged archdeacon Lawrence with dispersing the church's wealth to the needy. This deed aroused the ire of Emperor Valerian who had claimed the treasure for himself, and formed the basis for the charges brought against Lawrence and his eventual execution.In its setting in the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican, the dramatic impact of this fresco is aided by its position between two recessed windows. The scene is set in the nave of a basilica, the type of architectural space which in St Lawrence distributing Alms was used only as a backdrop. Five columns are visible on either side, and they are equalled in volume and monumentality by the bishops and other churchmen who witness St Lawrence kneeling before the Pope. The end wall of the basilica and its niche bring emphasis to no figure in the composition, for none stands at the centre. The central axis runs instead through the communion chalice which passes between the Pope and the saint.It is remarkable that in this fresco cycle the pope and the prelates wear azure vests, then rarely used and presently non-existent

34460-16rippl.jpg	"A great example of intimate interior pictures, it was awarded with the prize of the National Society of Art in 1906. It is closely linked  to the atmospheres and colours of ""White Wall with White Furniture"" and ""Flox and Filox"", but the intensity and variety of its colours are in favour of ""When One Lives on One's Memories"".  Its composition is superb: by applying space near and far he expresses the physical and psychic departure of  the old woman, the central figure of the picture, whose relationship to the world is slowly fading.

06475-01baptis.jpg	"Pieter Bruegel the Elder was the most important figure in sixteenth-century Flemish painting, the founder of a dynasty of painters. His realistic painting of peasants in both his secular and religious works gave him the nickname of ""Peasant Bruegel"". A number of copies of this picture, both contemporary and dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, have come down to us, and many of them are in museums in Flanders (Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels), as well as in Bonn, Schwerin, Leningrad, Munich and Cracow, mostly produced with the co-operation of his sons, Pieter and Jan, and his workshop employees. This tends to indicate that the picture remained in Brussels for a long time, or was in a collection in another town in the Netherlands which was easily accessible to the public.The numerous copies and variants of this painting with its theme of the Holy Baptism can also be explained by the widespread growth of the Anabaptist movement in those years of religious turbulence and strife. The date of the painting coincides with a period of iconoclasm in the Netherlands.This picture is probably identifiable as that known to have been in the collection of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, Governor of the Netherlands, in 1633. In this, the preaching Saint John the Baptist is virtually lost in the colourful throng of peasants, cripples, gipsies, mischievous children climbing trees, and trees painted with astounding realism. Even the river in the background and the distant church take a more prominent role in the whole than the impersonal figure of the saint in his hair-shirt"

30619-washing.jpg	In the 1880s, Lombardy began to play an active part in Italian art. The movement that originated there declared its loyalty to the great Italian tradition, and was particularly interested in atmospherics of light, colour, and texture. In the 1890s, such work came into its own with divisionist or pointillist paintings.In the work of Pellizza, the most important Lombard Neo-Impressionist, the goals of the leading French pointillist, Seurat, were most consistently pursued. This was apparent not only in his relinquishing romantic natural scenes such as Impressionism favoured, and preferring an art based upon ideas; he also dispensed with clear outlines, and used strong contrasts of juxtaposed colours.

11367-5delaroc.jpg	Anglomania was in fashion in France in the 1820s and 1830s. Interest in British history, fuelled by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, was further stimulated by parallels drawn between recent events in France and the turbulent accounts of Tudors, Stuarts and the Civil War. The pictorial representation of British history may have been pioneered in Britain, but it was the Frenchman Paul Delaroche who gained a European reputation with the grand scenes drawn from it which he exhibited at the annual Paris Salon between 1825 and 1835. Popularised through mass-produced engravings, these set pieces, combining ostentatious antiquarianism with the pseudo-realism of bourgeois melodrama, in turn influenced the painters of national history in mid-Victorian Britain.The painting depicts the last moments on 12 February 1554 in the life of the seventeen-year old Jane Grey, a great granddaughter of Henry VII who was proclaimed Queen of England upon the death of young King Edward VI, a Protestant like herself. She reigned for nine days in 1553, but, through the machinations of the partisans of Henry VIII's Catholic daughter, Mary Tudor, she was convicted of high treason and sentenced to death in the Tower of London.Delaroche, who based the painting on a sixteenth-century Protestant martyrology, has falsified the historical account the better to appeal to his contemporaries. Lady Jane Grey, a humanist-educated young married woman, was in fact executed out of doors. Attended by two gentlewomen, probably no less stoical than she, she resolutely made her own way to the block. She could not have worn a white satin dress of nineteenth-century cut with a whalebone corset, and her hair would have been tucked up, not streaming down over her shoulders. But a painting cannot be judged by the criteria of historical accuracy. Much more applicable to this particular picture are the standards of popular melodrama and tableau vivant.As on a stage, the heroine gropes her way towards the audience, gently guided by the elderly Constable of the Tower whose massive, dark, male presence acts as a foil to her own. A spotlight trained on her from above complements the dim stage lighting, reflecting from her immaculate dress and the straw which spills over into the front row of the stalls. The emotions of each actor are carefully delineated and distinguished, and we are left in no doubt as to the character of each even of the lady in the background who turns her back on the terrible sight

32267-19gather.jpg	It was already apparent to Poussin's contemporaries that the artist had given much thought, in The Israelites Gathering Manna, to the means by which painting could unfold a sequence of events before the eyes of the viewer. The artist combines selected aspects of the biblical story into one scene, so as to illustrate the scale of the Israelites' divine rescue from hunger and misery.This painting can be considered a variation on the Raphael fresco, The School of Athens, in the Vatican. Moses in particular, in his draperies and pointing gesture, directly cites the figure of Plato in Raphael's fresco. Poussin has simply transformed the latter's architectural backdrop into a rock formation and rotated the setting - which in the fresco lies parallel to the pictorial plane - as if on a turntable towards the right, so that it now leads away at a diagonal into the depths

The painter's brush is used with remarkable assurance, obviously practised in the creation of larger compositions as well. The artist has painted the sitter in profile against a golden background. The very individual character of the face is painted with great realism. A faintly perceptible smile hovers on the lips, the hair is red, the eyes blue. Without the inscription above his head 'Jehan, roi de France', one would hardly imagine it the portrait of a royal personage, a king whose life was full of vicissitudes, ruling during the hardships of the Hundred Years' War

09498-1wedding.jpg	The Haarlem government commissioned this painting to decorate a guesthouse for the Orange family and other dignitaries. The painting's reference to the beginnings of the Trojan War presented an impressive reminder that even trivial discord causes devastating wars. This was a topical message in Haarlem, which had suffered debilitating defeat in a Spanish siege of 1573. The work also showcased Haarlem's patronage of sophisticated international history painting.In this painting, depicting events leading up to the Trojan War, Cornelis van Haarlem represented the assembled gods as naked muscle-men and soft-skinned women, in endlessly varied poses. Their idealized, heroic bodies befit their immortality and the ominous event they witness. These figures were clearly based on drawings after the nude which Cornelis could have made in the small academy in Haarlem. His grand style would have reminded knowledgeable viewers of the history painting of the Italian Renaissance, specifically of Michelangelo and his followers, and of the praise for idealized nudity and difficult poses in sophisticated art theory

15231-4recamie.jpg	This is a case where a comparison will give a good idea of how differently the same subject was handled by Jacques-Louis David and one of his numerous pupils. David started the portrait of Madame R�camier in 1800 which was never finished. (However, incidentally, this portrait helped a contemporary item of furniture to become known under her name.) When the master learned that the lady had also commissioned his pupil G�rard to paint her, he is said to have refused any further service.In David's portrait, noble simplicity, expressed by the simple dress and the Spartan decoration, is also eloquent in the open face. This might well appear more to the modern viewer than G�rard's version, which was judged to be more representative and flattering at the time. And comparisons with portraits of Madame R�camier by other artists suggest that G�rard had achieved a better likeness than David. The Spartan severity of David's composition, the Neoclassical sparseness of the arrangement, the cool handling of the room, the distanced pose, with the lady turning her shoulder to the viewer, were all elements with which Neoclassicism had operated for long enough.G�rard, by contrast, sets the lady in a noble park loggia, where she seems to be inviting to conversation. Her low-cut bodice is seductive, the red curtain flatters the subject and gives the flesh a rosy tint. Where David gave the beautiful woman a rather severe touch around the mouth, G�rard embellishes her features with the hint of a gentle smile, making her look younger. By contrast, David's portrait in the antique manner looks rather forced. Perhaps these were the reasons why his painting was never finished. Madame R�camier gave G�rard's portrait of her to her admirer Prince Augustus of Prussia, a nephew of Frederick II, who had met the French beauty at the salon of Madame de Sta&#235;l. For state reasons a marriage was impossible, but in the painting Madame R�camier was ever present in the palace which Schinkel furnished for the Prince in 1817.After the death of the Prince the portrait was returned to Madame R�camier

As the artistic production of this master continues to be more clearly defined and studied from the technical point of view, it has become evident that some works in the oeuvre of Jan Gossart most likely belong to this group as well: the Holy Family in Saint Louis, the Lucretia in a private collection, and the Portrait of a Man in Hamilton.This master was influenced in part by Gossart's works in the 1520s but never entirely abandoned his attachment to Antwerp Mannerism

Gu�rin burnishes Napoleon's myth subtly, placing his hero to the rear and rather dwarfed by those he has pardoned, in a sort of inverted modesty. If the rebels are allowed dignity in defeat, it is to emphasize the magnanimity of the victor.

09138-diane.jpg	Only two signed paintings by Fran�ois Clouet are known to exist, of which this, generally regarded as one of the great masterpieces of the French Renaissance art, is one. The subject, shown seated in her bath, traditionally was believed to be the famous beauty, Diane de Poitiers (1499-1566), a favourite of Henry II and virtual ruler of France. However, this identification is now rejected, and the dating, placed either in the 1550s or around 1571 is debated. Diane do Poitiers. Other candidates for the identity of the sitter are Mary Stuart (Mary, Queen of Scots) and Marie Touchet, mistress to Charles IX.This is the classic portrayal of a Royal mistress in her official role, cool, beautiful, aloof, bejewelled even in her bath, accompanied by the strappings of her state: fine rooms, a noble child in the arms of its leering, accomplice-nurse, the sly Love-child stealing the fruits, the flower of passion in her hand.Regarding the several influences, Titian's influence has been cited. The motif of the servant in the background performing a domestic chore is seen as deriving from the Venus of Urbino. The painting also shows affinities to the highly polished surfaces and icy eroticism of Bronzino. The pose of the woman in the bathtub was derived from a composition by Leonardo, known as the Monna Vanna (now lost

40383-2quarat1.jpg	"The predella, today in the Museo Arcivescovile in Florence, belonged to an altarpiece that has been lost (but was originally painted for the church of San Bartolomeo at Quarate). It is stylistically close to the Prato frescoes, and it consists of three scenes: St John on Patmos, the Adoration of the Magi and Saints John and Ansano.Although some scholars do not believe it is the work of Uccello, it can be placed chronologically in the group of paintings accepted as Uccello's work. As certain critics have pointed out, the Quarate predella shows the same interest in narrative, lively colours and description of details which is typical of Uccello's production in the years when he was working on the Prato frescoes (1435-40). A feeling of abstraction pervades these scenes, today no more than a group of fragments of faded and almost undecipherable images, in which we can make out a few architectural structures shown in accurate perspective and some monks laid out according to geometric patterns. In the extravagant choice of colours Uccello appears to have given his fantasy free rein; in fact, as Vasari noted, ""he did not pay much attention to the rule of consistency in colour, as was usual in the painting of stories; for he made the fields blue, the cities red, and the buildings the colour he felt like."

15483-0chapel.jpg	"""... He did a chapel in Santissima Trinita for Francesco Sassetti with stories of St Francis, an admirable work, remarkable for its grace, finish and delicacy"" (Vasari).Francesco Sassetti had gained his wealth as a partner in the French branches of the Medici bank in Avignon and Lyon. He also spent over ten years representing the Medici bank in Genoa and occasionally in Geneva. But he was not always successful later on in his role as the chairman of the bank, and in 1484 was replaced by Giovanni Tornabuoni. By the end of the 1470s, Sassetti had already acquired the rights of patronage to a small side chapel, the second to the right of the choir in the Florentine church of Santissima Trinita. It was probable at this time that Ghirlandaio was commissioned to paint the chapel, which he decorated with frescoes between 1482 and 1485.The donor and his wife had themselves portrayed as life-sized figures kneeling in prayer at the side of the altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds. The donors are adoring the Christ Child, just like the shepherds in the panel painting. An incomplete inscription under their portraits names the day on which the chapel was consecrated, 25 December 1485, hence also the date by which it would have been completed. This year corresponds with the complete inscription on the altarpiece. In the Sassetti Chapel the artist combined secular, religious, and classical themes to produce a unique masterpiece.In the scenes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi, Ghirlandaio incorporated portraits of contemporaries and views of Florence: he recreated religious events to the Florence of his day. In contrast to the newly built Saint Fina Chapel, the Sassetti Chapel was old and in the Gothic style. On each of its three walls Ghirlandaio painted two scenes from the life of Saint Francis, completed by a seventh fresco in the tympanum over the arched entrance to the chapel. At the crown of the entrance arch, the Sassetti coat of arms is surrounded by a garland of fruit, a sculptural work made of terracotta. The fresco in the tympanum above shows a sibyl prophesying Christ's dominion over the world to Emperor Augustus. The fresco idealizes the classical period as the precursor to the Christian age, and this provides a link with the chapel's high point, the altarpiece, which depicts the birth of Christ. The grisaille figure of David outside the chapel can also be interpreted in this way.On the two side walls of the chapel are the black marble sarcophagi of Francesco Sassetti and his wife Nera Corsi, set into niches with round arches. Here the sculptural decorations are dominated by classical motifs; the sculptor Giuliano da Sangallo is sometimes identified as the artist. The tomb niches are framed by grisaille frescoes, in which Ghirlandaio cites motifs from classical coins. Above each are two monumental frescoes by Ghirlandaio, which clearly owe a debt to traditional images. There are still echoes of the pictorial order established by Giotto in Assisi over 160 years earlier. Ghirlandaio studied Giotto's frescoes in the Bardi Chapel, dating from about 1325, in the Franciscan church of Santa Croce in Florence, and made direct use of them"

05439-110madon.jpg	This painting shows the synthesis of trends that formed the style of Botticelli's painting. The composition of the painting resembles Lippi's art, but the figures are more delicately blended into the painting and their expressions and poses are more complicated.Behind the monumental, very sculptural figures is a broad, hilly landscape with a river. The boy-like angel appears to have just this moment stepped through the gap in the wall and come up to Mary and the child; he is presenting them with a bowl decorated with ears of grain and full of grapes. The Christ Child is blessing the gifts, which symbolize the bread and wine of the Eucharist.

22942-09ridott.jpg	"Pietro Longhi was first a pupil of Balestra and then of Crespi whose art was the source of his realism, which expressed a sober and sincere inner world, and a delight in detailed and fresh narrative. He conveyed his realism with wit and ease, whereas the immediacy with which he approached the landscape enriched his painting with a unique quality. Up to a certain point these elements can be discerned in pre-revolution French painting (Watteau, Chardin, Boucher and Lancret), whose influence also made itself felt in Pietro Longhi's realism. Only here and there did grotesque features appear in his art; he saw his figures with the eye of a sage and a gentle and witty impertinence is to be found in many of the scenes he depicted.Pietro Longhi became, by means of his genre-painting, one of the most faithful chroniclers of his age, and one who conjured up a regrettably vanished civilization. It should be borne in mind, however, that his connection with Goldoni and the teachings of Emilia encouraged him, through the observation of reality, to perform a kind of analysis of ""social depths""; he did not want to cause an upheaval but only wanted to point out &#151; perhaps tendentiously &#151; the ineptitude of a declining class of society. Although he did not pass sentence, he allowed his opinion to be known, being fully aware that changes were imminent. Sometimes he would ironically represent certain dandies, abbots and virgins"

14977-tahiti23.jpg	In 1889 Gauguin had painted a pair of works entitled Women Bathing (Life and Death) and Woman in the Waves (Ondine). The latter (in the Cleveland Museum of Art) depicts a naked woman, seen from behind, cast adrift in the waves, and in Fatata te miti he has reused the same subject, setting her within a Tahitian genre scene. In Ondine, Gauguin had treated the myth of the water-sprite who can only become human after having a child fathered by a man. Once again, he has explored the theme of the joy of sexual union as an essentially liberating activity, hinted at in the alternative title for The Loss of Virginity: The Awakening of Spring. In Fatata te miti the sexual abandonment is seen as part of the natural rhythm of Polynesian life (the two women do not appear perturbed at the presence of the fisherman in the background of the work), a notion that was integral to the highly popular Marriage of Loti, which Gauguin had read before visiting Tahiti and which was calculated to appeal to a Parisian audience

38903-00bagli1.jpg	The frescoes decorating the main hall of the villa in Massanzago in the Province of Padua were attributed until the 1980s to various eighteenth-century painters, such as Jacopo Guarana, Giovanni Battista Crosato or Giambattista Pittoni. However, it turned out that the frescoes are the early works by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Obvious stylistic and iconographic similarities between these frescoes and other early Tiepolo works were pointed out.The work at the Villa Baglioni began immediately after the wealthy Venetian publisher Giambattista Baglioni acquired in 1718 the seventeenth-century villa in Massanzago. The frescoes cover the entire wall surface of the main hall, illusionistically breaking through the walls and creating a boundless space, thanks to the faux architectural structure conceived by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna, who henceforth would be Tiepolo's most frequent collaborator, working on almost all of his large-scale decorative projects in Venice and the Veneto.The theme of the frescoes is the Myth of Phaethon, based on Ovid's Metamorphoses. The principal episode, Phaethon Asking His Father to Let Him Drive the Chariot of Sun, is staged on the east wall. The opposite wall is divided into two parts by the doors that lead into the hall from the monumental staircase. The right portion of the wall contains the Fall of Phaethon, the left part shows the Heliads, sisters of Phaethon. The frescoes on the short walls depict monochrome figures of the Four Regions of the World. The ceiling, which opens up to a faux sky, contains a depiction of The Triumph of Aurora

09037-12sylvia.jpg	Claude's very last picture, the Landscape with Ascanius Shooting the Stag of Sylvia is one of Claude's purest inspirations from the poetry of Virgil.In the painting the yellows have faded completely, leaving a bluish tinge over the whole, and the entire surface has been abraded. As a result the picture has an unnatural and ghostly feeling. The composition is one of Claude's most calculated, with trees, distant landscape and figures in total harmony. The Deruet-like figures are more.prominent than usual, with their bright blues and reds. The story is a tragic one: Ascanius accidentally shoots the stag of Sylvia, which unleashes a brutal war of revenge. It is fitting that Claude should have ended his career on this theme without depicting brutality, as it sums up his gentleness of temperament as an artist.The painting was executed for the Principe Colonna and was still in the collection in 1783

07586-53mercy0.jpg	From the fiefs of the Colonna family Caravaggio took refuge in Naples, in 1606. There he began to work again with his usual, astounding speed. Early in January 1607 he was paid for the immense altarpiece commissioned to him by the Pio Monte di Misericordia (where it may still be seen today). The painting shows the Seven Acts of Mercy. It is very complicated in its organization. Caravaggio actually had to add a series of figures (two angels and the Madonna and Child, the latter painted later) in the upper part of the painting, which make the composition of the picture the most complex, perhaps, in any of his works. Caravaggio did not paint exemplary episodes intended to stir the viewer to religious piety through the illustrative emphasis of gestures and feelings. Rather, he entrusted the educational effectiveness of his works to the evidence of things in themselves, in the conviction that nothing should be added above and beyond what is already contained in the intrinsic eloquence of the various poses.The seven acts of mercy represented on the painting are the following. On the right appear the (1) burial of the dead and the episode of the so-called Carita Romana (Cimon's daughter giving her father suck in prison), which contains at once the two charitable acts of (2) visiting prisoners and (3) feeding the hungry. (4) Dressing the naked appears in the foreground, symbolized by St. Martin and the beggar. Next to this scene, the host and St. James of Compostela allude to the (5) offering of hospitality to pilgrims. (6) Relieving the thirsty is represented by Samson drinking from the ox jaw. The youth on the ground behind the beggar of St. Martin may also represent the merciful gesture of (7) caring for the sick.We readily apprehend the artist's power of synthesis, which concentrates a conceptual content that is potentially quite dispersive, in the model behavior of a few figures.

29969-winter_s.jpg	Isack van Ostade was the short-lived younger brother of the painter of scenes from peasant life, Adriaen van Ostade. They were both born, lived and worked in Haarlem, and Isack was a pupil of his brother who was eleven years his senior. Isack joined the guild in 1643. His earliest paintings - the first dated picture is from 1639 - are peasant interiors dependent on Adriaen's, but towards the end of his brief career he became more interested in outdoor scenes and produced a series of beautiful and original landscapes, often set in winter. This deliberately picturesque view, its low viewpoint serving to outline the wooden bridge against the sky, is one of his finest paintings. It is rich in its treatment of the details of peasant life, whose harsh aspects (as seen, for example, in the figure of the man labouring under his load of faggots) are relieved by the pleasure taken by the child in the anticipation of skating on the frozen river.

21482-eremiti1.jpg	Shortly after the completion of the ceiling in the Galleria of the Palazzo Farnese, Annibale and his pupils, who included Domenichino and Giovanni Lanfranco, were asked to provide decorations for a palazzetto behind Palazzo Farnese, across the Via Giulia. The decoration consisted of mainly landscapes. In keeping with the character of the building, a casino in a garden, they represented mythological episodes. A few years later, Cardinal Odoardo Farnese decided to add a small room (Camerino degli Eremiti) to the Palazzetto Farnese as a Christian retreat where he could withdraw for his devotion. Giovanni Lanfranco was responsible for its entire decoration which consisted of four large frescoes, and nine ceiling panels, only two of which survived, Mary Magdalen Raised by Angels and Christ Served by Angels

11201-1880s_20.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene. Degas's matter-of-fact depictions of woman was criticized by his contemporaries

24868-madonna1.jpg	Although in the 1440s Filippo Lippi explored a variety of solutions for showing the Madonna and Child within or against an architectural niche, with the Child resting on a parapet - the finest example is that in Washington - in none of these is there a similar illusionistic intent, with the parapet and tabernacle window conceived as though projecting into the viewer's space. The point of reference for the author of this painting was certainly Donatello' Pazzi Madonna.The artist of this picture certainly spent time in the workshop of Filippo Lippi: the spherical heads and curiously boneless hands relate to Lippi's works of the late 1430s - especially the Tarquinia Madonna and the Barbadori Altarpiece

23627-refector.jpg	The Genoese Alessandro Magnasco was taught by his father Stefano and a little known Milanese painter, Filippo Abbiati, and began by painting in a conventional seventeenth-century style. During his stay in Florence at the beginning of the eighteenth century, however, he became acquainted with the work of Salvator Rosa and the etchings of Callot, and under their influence developed a content and style of his own. His themes were bizarre, different from anything to be seen in Genoa, Milan, or indeed anywhere in Italy; nor did his manner of painting resemble that of any other artist in Italy. He depicted imaginary scenes, capriccios in many of which monks are seen in strange settings or tiny figures in stormy landscapes. In his paintings, which are usually small, the figures are oddly elongated, the strokes of the brush vibrating and restless; indeed, everything seems to be in flickering movement.The number of people depicted in this painting and the richness of the decorations lead us to think that this may have been the General Chapter of the Franciscan Order

07880-1camerin.jpg	The Villa Caldogno is the result of one of Palladio's early projects. Its construction began in 1542, at the behest of Losco Caldogno, an aristocrat and silk merchant from Vicenza, who had inherited an agricultural complex and fields in Caldogno the year before. Construction of the building and the decoration of the interiors extended over a long period of time, brought to completion only in 1570.The fresco decoration of the loggia, the Central Hall, and two other rooms (Room of Scipio and Room of Sofonisba) was completed by Giovanni Antonio Fasolo and Giovanni Battista Zelotti by 1570. In 1646, the interior distribution of the space was modified and a new small room (camerino), connecting the Room of Scipio and the Room of Sofonisba, was frescoed by the young Venetian painter Giulio Carpioni. These frescoes illustrate scenes from Guarino Guarini's Pastor Fido (The Faithful Shepherd). The room was partly frescoed earlier by an unidentified sixteenth-century painter with some episodes taken from Torquato Tasso's Aminta.Carpioni's paintings in the camerino unfold in three compartments on the walls, each containing an episode from the poem; the compartments are embellished along the side edges with refined, colourful floral festoons. The scenes depict: The Coronation of the Nymph Amaryllis, Winner of the Kissing Competition; The Pursuit of Corsica by a Satyr; and the Wounding of Dorinda, Mistaken by the Shepherd Silvio for One of His Prey. In the corners of the room, as a connective element, are two unusual, extremely lively candelabra. Completing the cycle, above the two doors are the scenes Cupid Taming the Lion and The Struggle between Erote and Anterote

34926-07gartem.jpg	The fresco cycle in the vault of the monastery church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe narrates stories from the Old Testament in a rather confusing sequence. When establishing the narrative composition, priority was given to the arrangement of narrative events rather than to the continuous narrative flow. Thus, popular subjects, such as Noah's Ark, were made to stand out in spectacular fashion.As was common in the Middle Ages, the artist who created this picture showed the ark as a lateral elevation. Judging by its hull, the ark is a Viking ship with a stem fortified by monsters, and a three-story superstructure and small wheel-house just as described in the Bible.

07775-60meetin.jpg	"Canvas No. 6 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".The same colour tone and mood as in the Apotheosis, but used in a much more self-assured perspective composition, appears again in the Meeting between Pope Cyriacus and the Pilgrims. Scholars do not agree on the dating of this canvas and suggestions go from 1491, the same year as the Apotheosis of St Ursula, to 1493, the year of the Martyrdom of the Pilgrims and the Funeral of St Ursula. Even the question of the identification of the character in red standing next to Pope Cyriacus as Ermolao Barbaro, an eminent Humanist and the Venetian ambassador to the Vatican who died in 1493 after having fallen out of grace in Venice, is used in different ways by the advocates of the various chronological theories. The style of the canvas would appear to suggest a more mature period than the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne canvas, which dates from 1490.The scene of the meeting takes place in the bright afternoon light: to the left, the retinue of virgins is shown approaching along the path, while the English Prince and Ursula, in the centre, kneel in front of Pope Cyriacus; and to the right the procession of bishops, prelates and dignitaries unfolds in the bright, sunlit meadow outside the walls of Rome. Each figure projects its own shadow to emphasize the hour of the day in which the historic meeting is taking place; like a brilliant colour prism it revolves slowly in an atmosphere of absolute enchantment. The calculated stage-like arrangement of the characters is echoed in the setting of the eight standards, the white mitres, the regular geometric shapes of the huge construction of Castel Sant'Angelo. Not even the tiniest of details is lost on this enormous stage: the lavish ornamentation of the damask copes, or the group of clarion players standing out against the sky on the castle's bastions, or the ivy clinging to the walls"

32150-y_bull.jpg	In the work of Paulus Potter views of nature and animals are seen for their own sake, and not as a backdrop for human action. Potter can paint equally well the bright sunlight and the cool air, but his real fame lies with his penetrating portraits of animals. His best-known work is the life-size Young Bull, an unusual heroization of a single animal, a counterpart to the monumental trend of Ruisdael and Cuyp.Although at first sight it appears to be a portrait of a prize young bull Potter most probably composed his famous beast from studies of more than one animal since its dewlap, horns, and teeth belong to bulls of different ages. The ancient Greek painter Zeuxis used a similar method; when he painted his portrait of Helen in the city of Croton he chose five beautiful virgins, in order to copy the finest features of each, for in one woman he felt he could not find perfect beauty.What makes this painting so special is the fact that Potter painted something as ordinary as a bull on such a grand scale - which had never been done before. And despite this large size, he paid great attention to the smallest details.During the nineteenth century the Young Bull by the twenty-two-year-old Potter ranked close in fame to the Night Watch of Rembrandt. Later generations have been less captivated by Potter's fidelity to nature when he worked life-size. Although the shapes of the farmer, the tree, and the bull against the light sky are impressive and the textures of the animals have been convincingly represented by the use of an original impasto which approaches relief, the entire foreground of this huge canvas seems airless. Atmosphere enters the picture only in the lovely distant view on the right, where a sunny light plays upon the cattle in the meadows and on the woods, making this passage one of his loveliest landscapes. Potter is more consistent on a small scale, and his cabinet pieces show him at his best.

13632-09ferenc.jpg	According to the Bible, the older brothers who were jealous of their father's love sell Joseph to the Ishmailites (Book IV of the Old Testament). The picture  shows the most tragic scene of the betrayal. Joseph, stripped to the waist, is seized and led to the merchants in white burnous who have just arrived. Ferenczy's picture, which is the largest of all in size, opens prospects: in the background of the scene  there is a huge plain area with figures lining up in the foreground. It is not necessary to know the biblical story to understand what is going on. The foreground is divided according to  colours and forms (dark skinned people and figures wearing white mantles) which find their counterpoints in peaceful blue and brown patches of the background. The background and the sunset making colours brighter unite the composition with Joseph and a man in a luxurious mantle in the middle who rises to the same level of importance as Joseph is because of the golden mantle complementing the blue of the sky and the river.The picture was painted from beginning to end in the open air, as it is known from Val�r's letter to his father, the size of the picture must have presented a lot of technical problems.

17802-706goya.jpg	Like many other uncommissioned works, the subject of this painting has been interpreted in various ways and it has borne several descriptive titles. The woman reading the letter has been thought to be a portrait. One critic even suggested that she was the Duchess of Alba (who had died many years before the painting was made), and that she is represented with washerwomen in the background to illustrate a theme of 'Industry and Idleness'. It has also been suggested that Goya intended this painting as a pendant to Time and the Old Women. The two canvases are almost exactly the same size, were acquired for the Mus�e des Beaux-Arts, Lille, at the same time and have the same provenance. But there seems to be no obvious connection between the subjects of the two paintings and Time and the Old Women, which is known to have been in Goya's possession in 1812, is almost certainly a slightly earlier work. There is, in fact, little reason to doubt that the woman reading a letter, standing with her companion and a dog in front of a group of washerwomen, is a genre subject like the earlier tapestry cartoons and other decorative paintings. But the composition is less contrived and, as in many other works, chiefly the uncommissioned ones, it appears to be based on a scene that the artist had witnessed and recorded on the spot or from memory. This was one of four paintings by Goya in the collection of King Louis Philippe which had been obtained in Madrid from Goya's son

24478-portrait.jpg	The painting is in a poor state of conservation, the colours have altered dramatically. However, the portrait has an extraordinary presence. The face, defined by its sharp contour, is modeled like sculpture. The three-dimensional effect of the mazzocchio (the turban) is emphasized by being cut at the right edge of the picture. The portrait can be compared with various portraits by Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, especially the bystanders in the scene of St Peter preaching. This comparison points to a date about 1426-27, making this panel the earliest surviving independent portrait in fifteenth-century Florence

23922-tavern.jpg	In the 1620s in Roman circles, a definite change came about in the subject matter of musical paintings. The representation of figures playing musical instruments in 'cultivated' domestic interiors (the direct descendants of Caravaggio's Lute Player and Musicians) disappeared. Within the space of a very few years they were replaced by large numbers of representations of concerts in public places and 'popular' locations. One of the earlier examples of this new trend is Bartolomeo Manfredi's Tavern Scene with a Lute Player. One characteristic of the painting, besides the presence of the lute player in a non-musical context (he simply accompanies a scene in which people are eating and drinking), is the absence of a musical score, an attribute of 'cultivated' musical painting.

Hearing symbolized by the guitar, touch and sight by the butterfly, smell by the perfume of the plant, and taste by the oranges on top of the rock.

17967-06monte1.jpg	"After completing the cycle of St Francis, Benozzo painted the first bay in the monastery church's southern side aisle, known as the Chapel of St Jerome. The main wall shows a painted polyptych, the Madonna and Child surrounded by Saints. This creates the illusion that it continues in the fresco painted above it, as if it were a realistic addition in front of the wall. The curtain and the shadows of the pinnacles and triangular gables make a considerable contribution to creating this impression. Benozzo's artistic capabilities here reached the highest level of illusion. It addition, it is remarkable that the artist ""placed"" the Gothic work within a classical framework which he signed OPUS BENOZII DE FLORENZIA.Above the polyptych Christ on the Cross can be seen surrounded by four angels who are catching the blood dripping from his wounds. On either side below him, St Dominic and St Francis are kneeling on the left side, and St Romuald and St Sylvester on the right. The walls show St Jerome in the desert and the martyrdom of St Sebastian. In the vault the four evangelists appear with their attributes: St Matthew with the angel, St Mark with the lion, St Luke with the ox and St John with the eagle. On the arch separating the nave Christ delivering the blessing is portrayed. The left pilaster shows St Bernardine of Siena and the right one St Catherine of Alexandria"

18377-1704grec.jpg	There are many versions of The Agony in the Garden painted by El Greco and his workshop, it was one of his most successful inventions. He painted the subject both as a horizontal and as a vertical composition. The version in the Budapest museum is a good example of the vertical type. There are other vertical versions in And�jar, in Cuenca and in Buenos Aires. The intervention of El Greco's workshop can be assumed in all these paintings.In his religious compositions and portraits El Greco frequently repeated themes from his major works, with slight alterations, to meet different commissions. He broke away from the Renaissance tradition and ceased to depict reality and nature. In order to convey mystic emotions and to imbue his work with passion he distorted and elongated the forms and used stridently blazing colours to express the transcendental. The Agony in the Garden is such mystic interpretation representative of El Greco's late years and mature style.The painting depicts the last night of Christ on the Mount of Olives. In the foreground the tired pupils are sleeping, their unnaturally rigid robes refer to the wax models which the aged master used. Above them Christ is kneeling while an angel appears.

14954-tahiti01.jpg	Gauguin's Tahitian paintings celebrate the lushness and mysterious splendour of his new environment. At the same time they are seldom correct pictures of Tahitian life, from an anthropological standpoint, but rather feature recastings and recombinations of objects and persons taken out of their normal settings, as was the case with several of his paintings done in Brittany.The most important paintings executed during Gauguin's first stay in Tahiti are the Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary) and The Spectre Watches over Her (Manao Tupapau). In Ia Orana Maria Gauguin places the Christian story into a setting where both the figures and the vegetation are Polynesian. A Tahitian woman, her young son, and two women standing nearby are shown in the obvious attitudes of the Virgin and Child with attendant saints or worshiping angels.Once again Gauguin has returned to the theme of the effect of profound religious faith on an apparently simple people, which had preoccupied him in some of his most important Breton works. The apparently effortless fusion of Christian iconography with Tahitian subject matter is in fact carefully contrived, with the poses of the background figures lifted from the relief carving on the Javanese temple of Borobudur, photographs of which Gauguin had taken with him to Tahiti

21307-09magdam.jpg	Around 1620 a group of young French painters developed interesting derivations from works by Caravaggio. Among these we find Georges de la Tour. In his canvases he adopted the strong light and shade contrasts characteristics of Caravaggio's school, although in his chiaroscuro effects he preferred the Nordic tenebrosi's use of artificial light, such as candles and torches, which produces a dazzling effect and creates a more transcendental atmosphere that does not include the supernatural.

04123-peasants.jpg	Nicolaes Berchem, the son of a distinguished still-life painter, Pieter Claesz., was born in Haarlem. The town was a leading centre of landscape painting in the early seventeenth century and among Berchem's teachers was the landscapist Jan van Goyen. Like many Dutch artists, Berchem travelled to Italy immediately after completing his apprenticeship. He was in Rome late in 1642 and remained there for three years. While in Italy, Berchem made many drawings of the landscape of the Roman Campagna, its cattle and peasants.On his return to Haarlem Berchem quarried this rich material throughout a long and extremely productive career, painting (and etching) hundreds of Italianate pastoral scenes. As is evident from this painting, he interpreted the Italian landscape and the life of its peasants in an idyllic manner, emphasizing its timeless continuity by the inclusion of antique monuments. These buildings cannot be identified, as they are only loosely modelled on actual ruins. Berchem uses a bright, highly-coloured palette and applies the paint in short, stabbing brush strokes.In seventeenth-century Holland there was a constant demand for exotic landscapes of this type and Berchem was a highly successful artist. He moved to Amsterdam, which had a larger art market than Haarlem, in about 1677. His work was widely imitated and copied during his lifetime and his paintings enthusiastically sought after in France in the eighteenth century and in England in the nineteenth. This painting, having been in the distinguished Amsterdam collection of Gerrit Braamcamp in the mid-eighteenth century, was bought in Paris by the Duc de Chabot in 1780 and in London in 1840 by Sir Robert Peel

38632-bp_advic.jpg	"This painting having the popular title of Parental Admonition (another version in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin) was the subject of a charming passage by Goethe. In his ""Die Wahlverwandtschaften"" Goethe notes the delicacy of attitude of the figures. He remarks how the father quietly and moderately admonishes his daughter who is seen from behind. The woman in black, sipping from a glass, Goethe interprets as the young woman's mother, who lowers her eyes so as not to be too attentive to the 'father's admonition'. This moralizing title, however, is without foundation and not in accordance with Ter Borch's usual themes.The authoritative biographer of the artist interprets the picture in the opposite sense, as a brothel scene, assuming that the seated gentleman holds a coin in his right hand, offering it to the girl. In fact, the detail of the coin is not visible. (The coin is omitted in the engraving Goethe knew). In the Berlin version the passage is rubbed; a former owner may have had it painted over because she or he found it an embarrassing allusion. The Amsterdam version does not show the coin either, but its original paint surface is generally abraded; thus it is impossible to tell if it ever included the tell-tale coin.Ter Borch's psychology is so delicate that the  common scenes he repeatedly painted are raised to the level of highly civilized life. That Goethe's interpretation was possible at all shows the refinement of Ter Borch's treatment. Even if he made a mistake, Goethe had the right feeling for the way Ter Borch treated his subjects. Psychologically and pictorially he retains a sensitive touch and delicacy. The young woman is seen from behind; thus her face is averted. The only flesh visible is her neck, which is modelled with tender, silvery grey shadows. We have, however, opportunity to admire the silver-grey satin and black velvet of her gown.Ter Borch's minuteness and nicety of handling concentrate largely on painting stuffs. Contrary to Vermeer's paintings, the dim light and the subdued chiaroscuro do not allow a forceful grasp of the whole field of vision. The light comes mostly from the front and stops at the glossy surfaces of the costumes and other textures"

15943-venus.jpg	Giorgione exploited the new style evolved in Venice through sensual subject matter. The Sleeping Venus is a case in point. The reclining figure was originally accompanied by a small figure of Cupid, but this figure was painted over in 1843.Giorgione placed the Venus across the whole width of the painting. She stretches one arm behind her head, making a long, continuous slope of body whose gentle curves echo the hills of the landscape behind and suggest some form of connection between the female depicted and nature. Painted at just the moment when Venice was defending its claims on the terra firma, it may, therefore, be possible to read Venus (Venere) as Venice (Venezia).Venus's sensuality is heightened by her red lips and by the deep red velvet and white satin drapery upon which her creamy body lies. Significantly, she is asleep, so the issue of decorum is bypassed. Her sleep implies dreaming and transport of the figure to another world. Thus the painting may be interpreted as a poetic evocation of a classical idyll.Several works of great beauty associated with Giorgione involve the collaboration of another distinctive master. In the Sleeping Venus a significant share has been assumed for Titian, especially in the landscape, where on the right a cupid has been painted out. The outstretched figure, stocky in proportions, is usually considered to be by Giorgione. The drawing is only approximative, with the outlines blurred to produce a gradual transition between the barely modeled flesh and the surrounding surface. But the edges are nonetheless legible, and they form a flattened lozenge-shaped, pale, collage-like form lying close to the picture plane, a device favoured over juxtapositions of darks and lights to conjure up an illusion of three-dimensionality. Giorgione fully exploited the sensuous potential of both the medium and the subject. There is a decidedly erotic air to the totally unselfconscious young woman whose pale flesh is contrasted to the silky cloth.If compared with Titian's Venus of Urbino the differences between the two become clear since Titian has taken over the pose and the figural type almost verbatim from Giorgione; they are differences of temperament and personality more than of time passed. If the Sleeping Venus was actually completed by Titian, as is frequently assumed, the overall effect remains tightly connected with Giorgione's style, and one might also suppose that it falls chronologically near the end of his short career, for we should assume that it was left unfinished at his death

38424-2louis.jpg	Bertalan Sz�kely was the most fastidious master of the style known as historicism. He harboured the idea of painting The Discovery of the Body of King Louis the Second already during the years he spent in Transylvania following his studies in Vienna. After having clarified the role of each element of the composition, he painted the great work in 1860 in Munich, where he was studying under Piloty. Working out the structure and the accent of colours in detail was of prime importance for Sz�kely.The last Hungarian king from the Jagello Dynasty, the young Louis II (1516-1526), was slain in the Battle of Moh�cs. His passing symbolizes the death of the nation and the beginning of the Turkish suzerainty which lasted 150 years. The gestures of respect for the dead as well as the white shroud, which contrast dramatically with the sombre atmosphere, work in unison to focus our attention on the tragic figure of the Hungarian king

34948-5oberze4.jpg	The church of St. Georg in Oberzell on Reichenau Island is the home of one of the few narrative picture cycles on the subject of Christ's miracles to have survived as a complete set from the Ottonian period. It was certainly painted by Byzantine-trained artists who continued their travels after completing their work in Oberzell.The continuous painted cycle running around the walls of the nave was designed from the very beginning as a narrative cycle. With a single exception, Jesus enters each scene from the left, thus establishing the direction of reading from left to right. The viewer entering the space will also start on the left side, the north wall. There we have the Gerasene demoniac, followed by the Healing of the Sick, the Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and the Healing of the Man who was Born Blind. The south wall contains the following scenes: the Healing of the Leper, the Raising of the Young Man, the Healing of the Woman of her Bloody Issue, the Raising of the Daughter of Jairus and the Raising of Lazarus from the Dead.The picture shows the third scene on the north wall: The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. The second scene includes a building on the right with a white wall made of ashlars. The same wall can be seen on the left-hand side of the adjoining scene, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, then suddenly stops. This is where the Sea of Galilee begins. Also visible is the boat which is soon to find itself in a storm. The white ashlar walls must therefore form part of the fortification of the city which reaches down to the harbour

31871-hydra.jpg	"This small panel, the companion-piece to ""Hercules and Antaeus"", refers to three panels representing the Labours of Hercules which Antonio del Pollaiuolo painted for Lorenzo de' Medici around 1460, lost works we know about only from later versions.Here too is represented a ferocious fight between the hero, his body tensed into an agile, muscular mass and the legendary multi-headed monster. The outlines are very sharply defined, and the movement of nerves and tendons observed down to the last detail. Antonio del Pollaiuolo worked at time when thorough studies of anatomy were being made, and he therefore renders the human body realistically in its moments of greatest emotional excitement.The dramatic force of the episode is expressed in the hero's grimace of fatigue and horror, but also his certainty of victory.

23993-6sebasti.jpg	In 15th-century Italian art, portrayals of St Sebastian offered the opportunity of depicting an idealized nude figure in a classical setting. Mantegna tied the saint to the column of a triumphal arch both to emphasize his heroism and at the same time to stress the precise historic setting. The triumphal arch stands in a courtyard closed off by a wall. Debris from statues and a fragment of bacchanalian relief lie around, indicating the fall of the pagans and the victory of Christianity.A bearded horseman can be seen in the cloud to the left. Images in the cloud like this, already described in classical art theory and adopted by Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci, were ascribed to the genius of nature, which could stimulate artists and inspire them to improve on nature with their creations.The vertical inscription at the right side of the saint is the signature of Mantegna in Greek

13143-glorific.jpg	"The cross as the focal point of the ""gloria del paradiso"" is revered by the saints and the elect of the heavenly realm who surround the cross on banks of clouds. On the right, we recognize the patriarchs, including Moses, Abraham and King David. We also see Jonas sitting on the fish, looking up towards the cross, and St Catherine and Mary Magdalene in a sisterly embrace. In the foreground, there is a disputation between St Sebastian and Pope Gregory, St Jerome, St Ambrose and St Augustine, with the first Christian martyrs St Stephen and St Laurence. The cross, clutched by a kneeling female figure who is probably an embodiment of Faith, is surrounded by angels bearing the instruments of the Passion, above which we can make out the Evangelists and Apostles. At the head of a procession of angels streaming into the dazzling light of the background, which is flooded with an overwhelming brightness, we can see the Coronation of the Virgin.Elsheimer's unique art is evident in the astonishing illusion of remarkable breadth and depth achieved by this small panel painting. Here, space is no longer simply a problem of continuously reduced scale, but also one of simultaneous graduation of colour and the distribution of light and darkness. This creates interlocking areas of colour and light which, though perceived by the eye, nevertheless take on the quality of a vision. This painting, originally part of a triptych, is widely regarded as Elsheimer's greatest masterpiece"

The triumph of the emperor, who sits like a god in his triumphal chariot, is heralded and lauded - as shown by the presence of putti, which appear only in this painting, the laurel wreath with which Caesar is about to be crowned, the sculptures of conquered warriors on the triumphal arch, and the images of the gods

23189-32monaco.jpg	From the high altar of the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, where Lorenzo was a monk. Signed and dated. The Scenes of the Life of St Benedict in the predella, with their fairy tale charm, are to be reckoned among the highest achievements of the master.Lorenzo's elegant style reached maturity in this very large altarpiece.In this painting the edges of the figures' garments have an animation quite independent of the actual movement of the figures. Although the composition of the painting is quite conventional, the figures display a new fluidity in their poses and in the movements of their drapery which is suggestive of the International Style then being employed in sculpture by Ghiberti and Niccol&#242; Lamberti. Surface patterns vie for attention with the volumes of the figures; even the superimposition of figures tends to read as pattern. Brilliant, light-toned colour and the lavish use of gold and expensive ultramarine blue pigment would have made the painting a strong focal point in the church and would also have testified to its importance and to the donor's extraordinary generosity

04559-yosemite.jpg	Albert Bierstadt, a native of Germany, stood in the tradition of the Hudson River School, founded by the English-born Thomas Cole, which marked the beginning of a genuinely American landscape painting. He discovered the American wilderness for art, applying these means in the tradition of Claude Lorrain. In 1863, Bierstadt and the writer Fritz Hugh Ludlow set off on an expedition to the Wild West, which took them thousands of miles through the dramatic scenery of Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, California, and Oregon. The artist captured these impressions in a series of large-format panoramas that made him the founder of the Rocky Mountain School.Yosemite Valley at Sunset was a preliminary study for one of these large paintings. As dramatic as the area is in reality, Bierstadt heightened it still further, plunging the scene into a veritably mythical illumination. Bierstadt's views and the stereoscopic photographs his two brothers made of the Yosemite Mountains contributed to the declaration of the area as a national park

14560-06macbet.jpg	Fuseli was the second son of the Zurich portraitist and author Johann Caspar Fussli. His early contact with the teachings of Johann Jakob Bodmer familiarized him with the figures of world literature, which were to remain a major source of inspiration throughout his career. Ordained in 1761 as a pastor in the Zwinglian Reformed Church, he left Zurich two years later for political reasons, traveling by way of Berlin to London, where he settled. Initially Fuseli made his living by writing, while engaged in illustrating the works of his favourite authors, particularly William Shakespeare.The painting represents a scene from Shakespeare's Macbeth. It shows Lady Macbeth as a a sleep-walker in the corridor of a fortress. The terrified eyes of Lady Macbeth, by now lost between reality and nightmare, clutch at the viewer, almost as though trying to capture him and carry him off into her own unknown dimension

33484-02histor.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 468.The subject of the painting is debated. Some of the critics thinks it represents Artemisia taking the ashes of Mausolos, while others assume it shows Sophonisba taking the cup of poison. In any cases, it is a representation of matrimonial love therefore it is assumed that the painting depicts Saskia, the wife of the artist.Artemisia was the wife of Mausolus, the satrap of Caria in Asia Minor. She succeeded her husband on his death in 353 B.C., and erected a great monument to his memory at Halicarnassus - hence 'mausoleum'. It was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. It was said that she mixed the ashes of Mausolus in liquid which she then drank, thereby making herself, observes Valerius Maximus, making of herself a living, breathing tomb. Artemisia symbolizes a widow's devotion to her husband's memory. In Renaissance painting she is depicted holding a cup or goblet

20890-port_you.jpg	Even at the age of eleven, Angelica Kauffmann earned admiring praise for her portrait of Bishop Nevroni and although she would later concentrate on allegorical, antique, historical and religious themes in her paintings, the portrait was to remain the driving force behind her success throughout her life. She received so many commissions that her painting tended to become rather routine, taking on an increasing smoothness and superficial appeal at the expense of a more distinctive style. This Portrait of a Young Woman also has something routine about it, and is as pleasingly decorative as any interior decor that she might have created in her frequent collaboration with the English architect Robert Adam. Nevertheless, it does show a face as that of a highly sensitive personality

26106-28jerome.jpg	The legend of this fourth-century doctor of the Church only began to take shape in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. He was raised to the rank of cardinal, and given a faithful companion in the shape of a lion, from whose paw he was said to have removed a thorn. During his life as a hermit in the Syrian desert, Jerome sought to banish his sinful thoughts by chastising himself. The motif of the saint beating his chest with a stone was probably inspired by Italian examples, although no clear prototype springs to mind. Nevertheless, this still appears to be the first Netherlandish work to present on such a monumental scale a subject that was to become one of art's iconographical mainstays from the sixteenth century onwards. Interestingly, several similar paintings, possibly influenced by Memling, were produced in Bruges around this period and immediately afterwards. The saint kneels before a crucifix, bearded and bald, with the dark brown robe of the penitent about his naked body. His figure is tall and slim, and almost fills the foreground of the painting. Small, transparent droplets of blood well up from his bruised chest. His scarlet cardinal's cloak and hat lie on the ground behind him, as if he had just cast them off. The lion lies down faithfully beside him. The scene is enacted on a rocky plateau before a cave, which is the hermit's retreat.This fairly large panel is not very well known, and is sometimes treated with a degree of caution. Nevertheless, it is a fine example in every respect of Memling's vision and technique. Monumentally conceived, yet executed with an undramatically fresh and guileless realism, this St Jerome is one of the most elegant large figures in the artist's oeuvre. The spatial character of the slim, half-naked saint is comparable with the Stuttgart Bathsheba. The extremely free underdrawing, the elongated body shapes and a physiognomy that seems to prefigure that of Van Cleve or Massys suggest that both paintings were executed fairly late, although additional evidence would be required for more precise dating. A characteristic Memling trait is the way the emblematic attributes such as the crucifix, the lion and the cardinal's clothes are included in a natural manner. Taken together, it is like a moment from a story, despite the fact that the depicted elements refer to different periods of the saint's life. Furthermore, the crucifix consists of a genuine flesh-and-blood little body, put to death in miniature, with no attempt on the artist's part to portray it as a vision.We do not know whether the panel was autonomous, or whether it had wings or a companion piece. The small fragment depicting St Jerome and the Lion might have formed part of the left wing (private collection)

18747-guard213.jpg	This painting belongs to a series of twelve canvases, almost all in the Louvre, which recount the various episodes in the election of Doge Alvise Mocenigo of Venice in 1763. The artist faithfully copied the scenes drawn by Canaletto, engraved by Giambattista Brustolon and published in 1766. This has led to some confusion, and the canvases were formerly attributed to Canaletto, although their style was quite unmistakably that of Guardi. It seems likely that these pictures had been painted for Doge Alvise Mocenigo himself.

00370-5battle.jpg	This is the most famous painting of Altdorfer. Its subject is the victory of the young Alexander the Great in 333 B.C. over the Persian army of King Darius in the battle of Issos. The battle in fact took place in Turkey, however, on this painting it is shown in the rocky environment of the Alps with German cities in the background.The viewer, endowed with telescopic vision, witnesses the battle and the cosmic landscape. The ebb and flow of battle makes it difficult initially to distinguish the two sides. Altdorfer dressed the Macedonians like German knights and landsknechts (mercenary foot-soldiers), while the Persian warriors sport turbans and exotic attires. Hundreds of riders and foot-soldiers skirmish within sight of their battle standards. Darius' chariot, with mounted steel blades, cuts a path through the throng. Alexander, riding on Bucephalus, and some of his knights are in close pursuit. Darius escaped but at great cost: according to the tablet above, 100.000 Persian soldiers and 10.000 riders died. Although the actual toll was lower, Darius' army was decimated and his family was captured.

23540-2hunyadi.jpg	"From the mid-nineteenth century onwards, Hungarian painters began to paint historical scenes as well as landscapes, portraits and genre paintings. It was not merely a fashion in Hungary to follow the current Romantic Movement that originated in Paris, or the ""historism"" of the Munich and Vienna Academies; it went much deeper than that. At the defeat of the fight for independence, the nation escaped into its history. Along with Hungarian poets and writers, the painters recalled the glorious events of the past, searching for ideals of patriotism and heroism that had not been crushed by despotism.Viktor Madar�sz gained the first international appreciation for Hungarian painting when his picture, ""The Bewailing of L�szl� Hunyadi"" won the State Grand Prix at the 1861 Paris Salon Exhibition. This rather romantic historical painting of the Hunyadi tragedy epitomizes the national grief of the 1850s, and fans the fire of revenge. The dead body of the heroic L�szl� Hunyadi, son of the great J�nos Hunyadi, lies in Buda Castle Chapel. King L�szl� V, fearing for throne, had lured the popular young Hunyadi to his place with a promise of safe passage. Then he seized him and had him beheaded in the market place at Buda on March 16, 1457. At the feet of body, his mother, Erzs�bet Szil�gyi, and his bride, M�ria Gara, kneel in grief"

14906-early08.jpg	By 1883, and as a direct result of the collapse of the stock market the previous year, Gauguin's finances were in disarray, and he began to consider a change in career. This painting demonstrates an attempt to align himself with the landscape Impressionist painters, perhaps from a desire to make money from the sale of his works, and is in marked contrast to the more laboured works produced while he could still consider himself an amateur.The subject of a snowy landscape was a typical Impressionist device to enable the artist to study the effects of colour reflections on a white surface and was particularly favoured by Sisley. However, the handling in the sky and the foliage is more reminiscent of the work of Monet from this period. The spontaneity of the brushwork and the subject matter would suggest that the canvas was painted out of doors, but there is a small related sketch without the two foreground figures, probably done in front of the motif, which presumably forms the basis for this more finished, studio painting. This means that the two women were added later, and demonstrates that even at this date Gauguin did not feel tied to working solely from nature, and had already begun to use the subject of two conversing women which was to recur in his mature work

00195-5verospi.jpg	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Francesco Albani. The depictions are: Phoebus-Apollo and Personifications of the Seasons in the centre panel; Genii of Morning and Evening Twilight in the ovals; The Planetary Gods; Genii of Morning and Night with their Children Sleep and Death in the spandrels.Since antiquity, colonnades and porticoes with painted decoration have been distinguishing features of the palaces of ruling houses. In the seventeenth century the main focus in the painting of a loggia, an indispensable feature of the piano nobile in palaces and villas in Rome and elsewhere, was the vault. The original pattern for the Roman loggia was the loggia of the Villa Farnesina, painted by Raphael with free-floating figures in the spandrels and caps of the vault. The piano nobile loggia in the Palazzo Verospi, painted by Albani follows this pattern, but borrowings from the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese, from Reni's Aurora and Guercino's Aurora are also present

25051-double1.jpg	This double-sided panel once formed the wing of a now lost altarpiece, with the Adoration of the Magi originally serving as the interior panel and the Throne of Grace as the exterior. Formerly, the panel was in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. It was sold for the Acquisitions Fund in 2013.The style of this master and his workshop was greatly influenced by Flemish painters, in particular, Hugo van der Goes, whose Monforte Altarpiece may be seen as a direct inspiration for the individual figures in this work (particularly the second kneeling King in the Adoration). Furthermore, the picture is indicative of the influence which Rogier van der Weyden had on the group of Cologne painters working at the turn of the 16th century. Such influence on the present work can be seen in Rogier's Columba Altarpiece, which utilizes a similar spatial construction and figural arrangement found in the Adoration here

26143-37frag1.jpg	A number of correspondences, including dimensions, origins and inscriptions prove that the three fragments In Bucharest (the Standing Virgin and Child and the two panels with donors) belong together. They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656. The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half. The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height. It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way. The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors . The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits. The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs. We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side. If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date. Similar triangular pieces have also been inserted to the left and right of the woman. Like the horizontal strip above the heads in both panels, these additions (to replace damaged or sawn-out sections?) were already present in 1656, when the panels were part of the collection of Leopold Wilhelm

41411-18chape1.jpg	The two frescoes (Crucifixion and The Virgin and Donor) from the oratory of Mocchirolo constitute one of the most interesting and complete examples of the spreading influence of Tuscan art in northern Italy during the late fourteenth century. Count Porro, who commissioned the decoration of the oratory, is shown kneeling before the Madonna in The Virgin and Donor. Controlled and contained in feeling, the dramatic aspects of the tragedy of the Crucifixion are expressed in the noble pathos of the swooning Madonna. To maintain the equilibrium of the composition, the outward movement of her body is countered by the angels in flight and the columnar figure of St John.The modeling of the figures, achieved through gradations of intense colour, complements the measured narrative rhythm. In the portraits of the donors (members of the Porro family) on the walls, and in the figure of St Catherine, the drawing is light and precise. In both paintings the roseate colour is laid on in thin, transparent brushstrokes, and the tenuous compositional connections have an elegant subtlety

19902-01henry8.jpg	Henry VIII (1491-1547), king of England (1509-47), who presided over the beginnings of the English Renaissance and the English Reformation. His six wives were, successively, Catherine of Aragon (the mother of the future queen Mary I), Anne Boleyn (the mother of the future queen Elizabeth I), Jane Seymour (the mother of Henry's successor, Edward VI), Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Catherine Parr.This portrait is the only surviving individual portrait of Henry that Holbein himself painted. In terms of features, it corresponds largely to the figure in the Whitehall cartoon. Both portraits are likely to have been based on a single, now lost portrait study by Holbein. However, as a consequence of the small format of the panel painting, the heavy shoulder chain that the king wears in the monumental portrait is omitted here, and his sleeves are embroidered with a very delicate gold thread.This is the quintessential image of the overbearing and tyrannous monarch, from the year the dissolution of the monasteries (and the consequent appropriation of their wealth for the Crown and its servants) was instigated. Holbein depicts the King at `face value', without flattery, emphasizing the small, humourless eyes and mouth, the curiously flat cheeks and chin. Henry's bulky and capricious authority haunts the work despite its small size. Its condensation of magnificence run riot here takes the form of real gold used in the chain, jewellery and collar.The portrait is undoubtedly a tour de force; after its execution, Holbein's position at the court seems to have been secure, and he was used as a painter-ambassador when the King's marital plans unraveled in the late 1530s. Only his misleading portrayal of Anne of Cleves would check his popularity.The subsequent spawning of similar but less effective portraits of the king by Holbein's followers has tended to obscure the compelling mixture of simplicity and realism displayed in this design - the tilt and curve of the black and white hat, the fearful symmetry of the jewelled jacket and the modelling of the hands: imitators often managed either simplicity or realism but never both.

17299-selfpo26.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 522, JH 1356.Shortly before he left Paris and moved to Provence in late February 1888, van Gogh painted this final self-portrait. He is no longer dressed as the urban dandy, but in the blue blouson of the Parisian working class. He stands before his easel, holding his palette in a pose intentionally reminiscent of a self-portrait by Rembrandt which was then in the Louvre and well known to van Gogh. Perhaps the painting should be read as a kind of manifesto of the new orientation in his conception of himself as an artist and of his work - the intention to remove himself from the city and its bourgeois lifestyle, and the desire to be seen in a Dutch rather than a French tradition. The painting also betrays a growing confidence in himself as an artist: he appears with the insignia of his profession. Greater assurance is also evident in the handling. The earlier extreme experimentation with pure or broken colour and a textured and structuring brushwork has given way to a more controlled and coherent treatment. In the pose he has used, van Gogh evokes Rembrandt; but the painterly treatment and coloration remind us of another seventeenth-century Dutch artist - Frans Hals. The lessons van Gogh had learnt in Antwerp, explored in greater depth throughout the Paris period, are now successfully integrated into his work to produce a distinctive style

24767-c_thief.jpg	In his Nativity the Master of Fl�malle (Robert Campin) proved himself a sensitive painter of landscape, who knew how to portray the atmospheric subtleties of light and air; but he does not always use nature as the background for his compositions. In the Crucified Thief, the one surviving panel of a lost altarpiece, he resorts to the archaic device of a gold background, contrasting its abstraction with the marked individuality of the figures. The thief's face is contorted with pain, and the wounds where the cords have cut into the flesh are rendered in an extraordinarily brutal manner. The Roman soldiers looking on, particularly the one whose curly hair is held back by a white band and who is placing one hand on his heart, are portrayed with a realism that was at that time outstanding

23811-4olympi1.jpg	This canvas was the most vociferously decried painting of the 1865 Salon. In fact, Manet has painted it in 1863 but had apparently not dared submit it in 1864. Olympia is another painting packed with allusions to past masterpieces, notably Titian's Venus of Urbino and Goya's Naked Maja. This whole tradition, from the odalisque to the black slave, continues (particularly with Ingres) throughout the nineteenth century, but what was surprising here was the absence of any exoticism, of either period or location, and the portrayal of a modern prostitute.The painting of the period was not at all averse to flowers, and Courbet, Fantin-Latour, and Manet all painted many pictures with flowers in them. Among the best known bunches (this time wrapped in florist's paper, like those that later Degas placed in the hands of his dancers as they took their bow) is the one being presented by a black servant to Olympia

04735-adoratio.jpg	The Catholic painter Abraham, resident in predominantly Catholic Utrecht, painted spectacular altarpieces in the style reminiscent of sixteenth-century Italian painting. He painted this altarpiece, one of his largest, for the church of the Catholic order of the Jesuits in Brussels, in the Southern Netherlands.

03387-stillmus.jpg	"Because he was in holy orders, Baschenis is sometimes referred to as Father Evaristo. The Bergamese Baschenis was, more than anything else, the perfect example of a ""specialist"" painter. In fact nearly all his oeuvre was dedicated to painting musical instruments, sometimes his pictures being finished by other painters who added figures (as in the case of two paintings that have recently been found in the Brera in Milan). From this specific point of view, Baschenis is one of the most fascinating and focused painters of the whole of the seventeenth century. His use of realism and light is reminiscent of Caravaggio. His canvases had an intense quality which was dominated by his exceptional technical ability (one thing that stands out is the way in which he depicted dust on the back of stringed instruments).But Baschenis' work never degenerated into a mere display of virtuoso talent. It was rather directed to convey a sense of almost severe moral purpose. Baschenis' success with still-life gave rise, especially in Bergamo itself, to a real fashion for the genre, with other painters following his example."

18777-guard400.jpg	This painting is a view of the Campo San Zanipolo with the loggia temporarily erected outside the Scuola di San Marco for the benediction of Pope Pius VI on 19 May 1782.In May 1782, Pope Pius VI visited the city of Venice. The ceremonies and festivities on that occasion were recorded by Francesco Guardi in a series of four paintings. The city council commissioned Guardi to make four paintings representing the following subjects: the arrival of the pontiff near San Giorgio in Alga, the papal mass in SS Giovanni e Paolo, the papal audience and the blessing of the people on Campo SS Giovanni e Paolo.On the occasion of the Pope Pius VI blessing the crowd a temporary wooden loggia, designed by Antonio Codognato, was erected on the fa�ade of the Scuola di San Marco. Once the Pope had finished his blessing the crowds were allowed to mount the loggia and the existence of at least three variants of this subject, including the present one, attest to the popularity of the composition

35578-23gevart.jpg	"This is a portrait of Rubens' friend Jan Gaspar Gevaerts (1593-1666). He was a reputable philologist, Neo-Latin poet and historiographer. Characteristically for his intellectual circles he had his name Latinized to Gevartius.After a stay in Holland and Paris Gevartius became the Registrar of the city of Antwerp. In this function he was in charge of official ceremonies in the city and in 1635 helped Rubens with the ""Pompa Introitus Ferdinandi"", one of Rubens most impressive projects.Rubens here intends to represent his friend's humanist attitude: he is sitting at his desk, with a bust of the Roman Emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius, on whom he wrote an unpublished commentary. The painting is dated around 1628. The composition of the work is not baroque, but fits more easily into the 16th-century tradition of homely portraits of humanists"

08303-pitti.jpg	The picture shows the south wall of the Salone Terreno (Room of Giovanni da San Giovanni) on the ground floor of the Palazzo Pitti.The Palazzo Pitti in Florence, purchased from the Pitti family by the wife of Duke CosimoI de' Medici in 1549 and renovated and expanded by Bartolommeo Ammanati, served as a residence of royal proportions for roughly 350 years. It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno). Its virtuoso wealth of forms, the scenographic bravura of its architectural painting, and its strikingly original programmatic concept, makes the room an outstanding example of seventeenth-century Florentine painting, standing as it does between tradition and modernism. The east wall of the Salone and the ceiling was painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1635-36, the south wall by Cecco Bravo in 1638, the west wall by Ottavio Vannini in 1639-41, and the north wall by Francesco Furini in 1640-42.The wall paintings deal with Lorenzo de' Medici and the return of the Golden Age under his rule. Cecco Bravo's frescoes present Lorenzo, who is always shown in fifteenth-century costume, as protector of the Muses and Apollo and as a bringer of peace

13722-marthama.jpg	In composition and overall approach to subject matter Giovanni Andrea appears to have been influenced by Caravaggio's canvas of the same subject. However, while Caravaggio's composition is underpinned by a complex visual and literal tradition associated with this subject, Giovanni Andrea's interpretation appears to be more closely associated with allegorical genre scenes by Venetian masters, such as Titian or Palma Vecchio. Such influence could only have been transmuted into Giovanni Andrea's work through his most influential master, Bernardo Strozzi. Several borrowings from Strozzi are apparent in the present work

05533-51lemmi.jpg	The only secular frescoes by Botticelli that still exist were discovered 1873, in the Villa Lemmi, at the foot of the Careggi Hill, close to a villa of Cosimo de Medici. They had been concealed under old coats of paint for centuries. Villa Lemmi belonged to the Tornabuoni family, friend of the Medici. It is possible that the frescoes were commissioned on the occasion of a marriage between members of the Tornabuoni and Albizzi families. For a long time the view was held that the couple in question were Giovanna degli Albizzi and Lorenzo Tornabuoni, who married in 1486. This assumption has, however, since been proven wrong, for the face of Giovanna that we know from a medallion does not agree with the lady in Botticell's fresco. A possible alternative could be Nanna Tornabuoni and Matteo degli Albizzi, who married in about 1484.It is supposed the frescoes were executed to commemorate the marriage of Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi.The frescoes are in a very poor state of preservation, because they were damaged when taken down from the wall. Two of the three fragments found were transferred to canvas and later sold to the Louvre in Paris. The two compositions were originally separated only by a window.One of the fragments probably  represents Venus and the Three Graces Presenting Gifts to a Young Woman, the other A Young Man Being Introduced to the Seven Liberal Arts.On this painting there is a strange lack of certainty as to the identity of the group of four young classically dressed women, who are gracefully stepping towards a young woman in front of the splashing spring in order to bring her gifts. They may be Venus and the Three Graces, symbolizing chastity, beauty and love
