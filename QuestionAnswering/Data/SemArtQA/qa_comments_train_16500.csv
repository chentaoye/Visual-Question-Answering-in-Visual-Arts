30016-italia1.jpg	This painting was inspired by the novel and painting Shulamit and Mary by Franz Pforr. In his painting Pforr separates the Italian and the German worlds, the Old and the New Testament, while Overbeck eliminates the division and creates a sisterly unity. Rightly the title was changed five years later to Italia and Germania, for the clothes, the laurel and myrtle wreaths and of course the different landscapes and houses make it very evident what is meant. The physiognomy and the character of the two women is Overbeck's interpretation of Italian and German girls. The girls are shown as imaginary brides, wonderfully idealized and so delicately perceived that they have hardly an equal in Nazarene art. Overbeck has set a monument to the encounter of German artists with Italy that could hardly be more ardent or worthy of its subject

26623-09_4sw.jpg	The picture shows the Ignudo at the upper left corner of the Separation of Light from Darkness (above the prophet Jeremiah).The poses of the four ignudi are very different from each other, without any attempt being made to obtain an effect of symmetry. Thus, the one above Jeremiah at the left, with a classical profile and a meditative attitude, contrasts sharply with the ungainly movement of the one the right, who laden with foliage and acorns, is throwing himself forward, his face in the shadow. On the opposite side, the two figures bend toward the centre, but with their torsos heads rotating in opposite directions with clearly distinct movements, splendidly rendered thanks to the artist's skilled use of perspective

14042-m_saints.jpg	"Inscribed ""MCCCCLXXXV DIE X OCTVBR"" on the lower fillet of the parapet, originally in the sacristy of S. Maria di Brera, it was removed in 1808 when the church was dismantled. The fresco was formerly attributed to Bramantino.This fresco is fundamental to Foppa's career. The simple surface divisions of his earlier work have been replaced by representations of fully three-dimensional architecture. The grandiose barrel vault of sculptured profiles, set in medallions in the tympanums, shows the influence of Bramante. The fullness of the compositional forms and their spectacular effect, as well as the triumphant character of the Madonna, reveal Foppa's intimate lyric qualities. His lyricism is seen at its strongest in the harmonies of subdued blues, reds and greens, and in the silvery chiaroscuro of Mary's face, which is a miraculous transformation of light into substance"

32815-41cather.jpg	Half-way between a work of private devotion and a collector's piece, this picture was probably painted just before Raphael's move to Rome. Rather more evident than the influence of Perugino is that of Leonardo, who perfected the `serpentine' pose in which the body twists about its axis, lending movement, grace and three-dimensional presence even to static figures. Characteristically, Raphael justifies this unnatural position through a narrative device: Catherine turns her head upwards and to her right in ecstatic communion with the divine light descending in thin gold rays from the sky.St Catherine of Alexandria is portrayed in a marvellous, twisted pose. Her left arm is leaning on her attribute, the wheel, and her right hand is pressed to her breast while she gazes up at a sky flooded with light. The composition is as rich in harmonious movement as the coloration is full and varied.The landscape is painted with particular care. Its light shading indicates a residual influence of Leonardo, although the jagged mountains which often characterize Leonardo's landscapes are absent. The delicate modelling of the saint, the slight torsion of her body as she leans on the wheel of her martyrdom (whose spikes have been reduced to rounded knobs in order to tone down the element of cruelty) fully express the balanced character of Raphael's art. The panel clearly shows the intense formal research which underlies Raphael's figurative creations. He is always careful not to excite emotions which he considers too intense and to mitigate tones and thematic elements in search of a perfect balance between design, colour, pose and expression, and between the figurative and ornamental elements

00841-07_chris.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 7 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.The contemplative restraint of the San Marco frescoes is nowhere better illustrated than in The Mocking of Christ. Rather than paint Christ's humiliations in their full violence in a complex narrative work, they are reduced to a series of iconographic symbols. In doing this Angelico was drawing on established trecento precedents.In a plain-walled room Christ sits on a dais in a luminous white robe and tunic. The great slab of white marble beneath Him adds to the air of radiant whiteness surrounding Him. He is blindfolded, with a crown of thorns about his head. Behind Him hanging from a plain frieze is a screen on which are painted the emblems of his indignities: the head of the spitting soldier, the hands of the buffeters, the hand and stick forcing the thorns down on his head. On a low step at the front of the picture sit the Virgin and St Dominic. Neither regard Christ but sit with their backs turned towards him in poses of intense meditation - the depth of meditation that the frescoes were designed to assist each friar to attain.Fra Angelico was assisted by Benozzo Gozzoli in the execution of this fresco

07204-canal406.jpg	In the 1730s Canaletto received many commissions from Great Britain, these included 24 vedute for the Duke of Bedford. These depicted the most famous sights of Venice, though a few of them are devoted to less well-known location, like the Campo Santa Maria Formosa, the View of the Entrance to the Arsenal and the Campo San Rocco.This painting is one of 24 works by Canaletto bought by the 4th Duke of Bedford which remain together at Woburn Abbey.The powerful Venetian fleets were built in the city's Arsenal, or naval boatyard, which had been established in the twelfth century. This view shows its water entrance, with dry docks and a ship inside, and to the left the Great Gateway which was built in 1460.Canaletto followed the preparatory composition he established on paper in the painting in most respects, although in the latter he placed the two towers either side of the entrance further apart. The diagonals of the wooden footbridge in the foreground effectively vary and break up what would otherwise be a very static composition based upon vertical and horizontal emphases

02833-scene_ic.jpg	Hendrick Avercamp was known as de stom van Kampen (the mute of Kampen) because he was dumb. He was baptized in the Old Church in Amsterdam on 27 January 1585 but in the following year his parents moved to Kampen where his father was the town apothecary. Avercamp seems to have trained in Amsterdam with Pieter Isaacsz., who was a history painter, portraitist and draughtsman in an elegant, late Mannerist style quite unlike that of Avercamp. Avercamp's manner is based in the first place on that of the Flemish followers of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and he presumably came into contact with some of his followers who had settled in Amsterdam, such as David Vinckboons. Avercamp developed the style of Bruegel and Vinckboons in the direction of more decorative effects, creating scenes crammed with small figures and full of incident. He also possessed a refined sense of colour, carefully placing pinks, reds, blacks and whites with touches of yellow and green to create delicate and subtle effects. He principally painted winter scenes and made many watercolours of these and of fishermen and peasants: a large group of these watercolours is in the Royal Collection.There are dated paintings by Avercamp from 1608 until 1632 but they show relatively little development in style: the earlier paintings are more 'Flemish', that is, closer to Bruegel and his followers; but once he had mastered a successful style Avercamp saw little need to change it substantially. The dating of paintings which do not bear a date is therefore difficult but this particular winter landscape appears to be from about 1615. It has been supposed that the building on the right is the Half Moon Brewery at Kampen but only a few barrels outside suggest it is a brewery, and the vaguely indicated town in the distance does not seem to be Kampen. The tower is closer to that of the Sint Cunerakerk in Rhenen.Avercamp was buried in the Sint Nicolaaskerk in Kampen on 15 May 1634. His nephew, Barent Pietersz.

21954-1monali.jpg	According to Vasari, this picture is a portrait of Mona or Monna (short for Madonna) Lisa, who was born in Florence in 1479 and in 1495 married the Marquese del Giocondo, a Florentine of some standing - hence the painting's other name, `La Gioconda'. This identification, however, has sometimes been questioned.Leonardo took the picture with him from Florence to Milan, and later to France. It must have been this portrait which was seen at Cloux, near Amboise, on 10 October 1517 by the Cardinal of Aragon and his secretary, Antonio de Beatis. There is a slight difficulty here, however, because Beatis says that the portrait had been painted at the wish of Giuliano de Medici. Historians have attempted to solve this problem by suggesting that Monna del Giocondo had been Giuliano's mistress.The painting was probably acquired by Fran�ois I from Leonardo himself, or after his death from his executor Melzi. It is recorded as being at Fontainebleau by Vasari (1550), Lomazzo (1590), Peiresc, and Cassiano del Pozzo (1625). The latter relates that when the Duke of Buckingham came to the French court to seek the hand of Henrietta of France for Charles I, he made it known that the King was most anxious to own this painting; but the courtiers of Louis XIII prevented him from parting with the picture. It was put on exhibition in the Mus�e Napol�on in I8o4; before that, in 1800, Bonaparte had it in his room in the Tuileries.From the beginning it was greatly admired and much copied, and it came to be considered the prototype of the Renaissance portrait. It became even more famous in 1911, when it was stolen from the Salle Carr�e on 21 August 1911 by Vicenzo Perrugia, an Italian workman. In 1913 it was found in Florence, exhibited at the Uffizi, then in Rome and Milan, and brought back to Paris on 31 December in the same year.This figure of a woman, dressed in the Florentine fashion of her day and seated in a visionary, mountainous landscape, is a remarkable instance of Leonardo's sfumato technique of soft, heavily shaded modeling. The Mona Lisa's enigmatic expression, which seems both alluring and aloof, has given the portrait universal fame. Reams have been written about this small masterpiece by Leonardo, and the gentle woman who is its subject has been adapted in turn as an aesthetic, philosophical and advertising symbol, entering eventually into the irreverent parodies of the Dada and Surrealist artists.Vasari relates that Leonardo worked on it for four years without being able to finish it; yet the picture gives the impression of being completely realized. The dates suggested for it vary between 1503 and 1513, the most widely accepted being 1503-05.Taking a living model as his point of departure, Leonardo has expressed in an ideal form the concept of balanced and integrated humanity. The smile stands for the movement of life, and the mystery of the soul. The misty blue mountains, towering above the plain and its river, symbolize the universe

04803-cremona1.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Christ is depicted as floating on clouds encircled by an aureole as he offers a blessing, accompanied by the symbols of the four evangelists and surrounded by four of Cremona's patron saints: Marcellino and Imerio on the left, Omobono and Pietro Esorcista on the right

26519-1donitop.jpg	The Doni tondo is Michelangelo's sole unanimously accepted panel painting. His only other documented easel painting, The Leda and the Swan, seems to have been destroyed and must be reconstructed from autograph drawings and copies. The tondo was probably produced for the same Doni for whom Raphael painted the pair of portraits, now in the Palazzo Pitti.The Holy Family is in the foreground. The Virgin, a muscular young woman, is turning round with a complicated movement to take the Christ Child Joseph is handing to her over her shoulder. The meaning of this scene is both theologically and philosophically obscure, as is the significance of the naked  young men in the background.The spectacular gilt wood frame, attributed to the Tasso family of woodcarvers, displays the Doni family arms with lions on them intermingled with Strozzi crescents. As well as grotesques, the frame contains the heads of two prophets and two sibyls surmounted by one of Christ. The outstanding quality of these busts - evoking similar figures of Lorenzo Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise - has lead some scholars to believe that Michelangelo may have had a hand in designing the frame

21183-crucifix.jpg	"In its own period the work reproduced here (the central panel of the Wildungen Altarpiece) was notable for its huge dimensions.The crosses of Christ and the two thieves stand before a golden background in a rather arid landscape. In the rear the horizon is closed by the dark silhouette of bushes. Christ's long, thin body, practically boneless, as if echoing the curve of the frame, diverges from the vertical beam of the cross.The stage of Golgotha is populated by smaller groups of people. In the foreground three holy women (the three Maries) surround the figure of the Virgin, who has collapsed. They are not crushed by savage despair, but rather seized with gentle, languid sorrow. Indeed, the whole representation is charac- terized by a soft, lyrical mood rather than by dramatic qualities, the only exception being St John, who, standing behind the Maries, raises his hands passionately. But his figure remains isolated and his lamentations do not elicit an echo from any of the other characters. On the right, Roman officers dressed in the gorgeous and bizarre apparel of medieval knights are talking about the crucifixion as an event that took place in the recent past but not in the present. They pay attention to one another rather than to Christ. Pilate wears a crown and holds a long staff, and gives special stress to his words by pointing upwards with his forefinger, as he tries to convince the knight in a red cloak about the divinity of the crucified Man. Holding an inscribed scroll in his lifted right hand, the centurion with the red helmet is similarly attempting to convince the nobleman beside him. As far as the composition is concerned the scroll inscribed with the words ""He was the Son of God indeed"" provides an equilibrium with the two figures on the other side of the cross. They are Longinus and his page, who, with an elegant gesture, directs the spear of the blind old man to Christ's chest. Konrad von Soest did not emphasize the dramatic element in this instance either, since the figure of Longinus is already surrounded by an aura of conversion. (According to the legend he was converted only after the stab of the lance.) Their figures are echoed by two others who are just arriving on the left-hand edge of the picture. While they were just taking a walk, the two men seem to have been stopped by the sight of the three crosses and have diverted their talk from its original subject. Their figures are meant to point out that such scenes were everyday occurrences; for them the crucifixion of Christ and the thieves is nothing but one of the series of executions that took place every day in the Roman Empire. A similar role is given to the three inquisitive men on the right-hand edge of the composition. The figure of the peasant holding an axe is particularly fascinating. He is a simple man afraid of dying, his features seem to reflect those of the unrepentant thief."

30219-4ducale2.jpg	The present decoration of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Palazzo Ducale was realized after the disastrous fire of 1577 during which all the structures of the ship's-keel Gothic ceiling and the wall-paintings were destroyed. An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings. The canvases were dedicated, thematically, to the Glorification of Venice, in remembrance of the numerous military undertakings in the East or on the mainland by the Venetian ground troops. On the ceiling great importance was given to the victories of the Venetian army in conquering the mainland; along the wall to the dispute between Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa, who reached an agreement in Venice with the political mediation of Doge Sebastiano Ziani; and to the events of the Fourth Crusade, led by Doge Enrico Dandolo in the early years of the 13th century.This painting is one of the large central canvases on the ceiling of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio.

08492-07early.jpg	Achille Emp�raire (1829-1898) was C�zanne's fellow-student at the Atelier Suisse, whom he greatly respected. Emp�raire lived in extreme poverty; a hunch-backed dwarf, he never achieved recognition during his lifetime. C�zanne's portrait pays homage to his friend, showing him in a combination of dignified melancholy and pride.The portraits of C�zanne's father and Emp�raire, each sitting in the same chair, were painted only a few years apart. A comparison shows how much C�zanne's style had changed during this short period: the flowery seat cover in the portrait of his father is painted in an Impressionist manner, but the decoration on Emp�raire's chair is shown very precisely, almost schematically.This painting was submitted to the 1870 Salon.

17978-02scene.jpg	"The second picture shows St Francis Giving away his Clothes, Vision of the Church Militant and Triumphant, two events from the saint's youth. What are conspicuous here are the weightings in the construction of the pictorial space. St Francis Giving away his Clothes seems to be pushed to the edge, clamped in between the frame on the left and the central building where the Vision is taking place. The well-dressed supplicant who is not, in contrast with tradition, depicted as a beggar is untypical. There can only have been one reason for taking this unusual approach to the theme: St Francis was not only merciful to the poorest members of society.The narration of the Vision encompasses two spatially transposed areas of the painting. Due to the repeated use of the vine scroll pattern, the building in the foreground can be recognized as St Francis' parental home. Francis is lying within, asleep on a bed. As he dreams, Christ appears to him in a crown of clouds. He gazes down on the sleeping man and points to the right at a building decorated with numerous coats of arms and flags bearing the Cross. This is, as the inscription below the picture confirms, the castle which Christ shows the young St Francis in a vision: QUAL(ITER) B. F. DEDIT VESTIMENTUM SUU(M) CUIDA(M) PAU(PER)I MILITI NOCTE VERO SEQUE(N)TI OSTE(N)DIT SIBI XPS MAGNU(M) PALATIU(M) ARMIS MILITARIBUS CUM CRUCIBUS INSIGNITIUM ""How St Francis gave his clothes to a poor soldier and Christ, during the following night, showed him a large castle decorated with coats of arms and crosses.""This scene is, in terms of form and colour, placed in relationship to St  Francis Giving away his Clothes, for the rock formation that towers up behind the saint also appears in the background of the castle and presumably continues behind his parents' house. That makes the pictorial space appear considerably broader. In addition, the colours of St Francis' horse, his red garment and green cloak are related to the beflagged castle. The interpretation of this connection suggests itself: ""Caritas"" the saint's active brotherly love, is one of the three theological virtues and a ""pillar"" in the castle as a symbol of the heavenly Jerusalem"

29382-triptych.jpg	Nardo, who with brothers Andrea (called Orcagna) and Jacopo had Florence's busiest workshop in the late 1300s, painted this small work similar to a church altarpiece for use in private devotion at home. It may have been specifically commissioned or bought from stock. The wings pivot to close like shutters; because they protected the surface, this painting is especially well preserved. Its splendour and clear colours, now rare, must have been typical.Nardo's Virgin, despite her soft expression, appears removed from human concerns. Bright, artificial colours separate her from the real world, and the stiff saints on either side underscore her hierarchical importance. Around the middle of the fourteenth century, Florentine artists like Nardo and his brothers abandoned the human concerns and naturalism of Giotto. For several decades the older, traditional styles again predominated. Art historians continue to debate why this occurred. Perhaps Giotto's work was only appreciated, as Petrarch believed, by a small, educated elite.Perhaps intensified religious sentiment following the plague of 1348 -- when up to half the population of Italian cities died within a few weeks -- prompted this conservatism. Or perhaps the deaths of so many artists and patrons changed the nature of commissions and workshop practice

34946-5oberze2.jpg	The church of St. Georg in Oberzell on Reichenau Island is the home of one of the few narrative picture cycles on the subject of Christ's miracles to have survived as a complete set from the Ottonian period. It was certainly painted by Byzantine-trained artists who continued their travels after completing their work in Oberzell.The continuous painted cycle running around the walls of the nave was designed from the very beginning as a narrative cycle. With a single exception, Jesus enters each scene from the left, thus establishing the direction of reading from left to right. The viewer entering the space will also start on the left side, the north wall. There we have the Gerasene demoniac, followed by the Healing of the Sick, the Storm on the Sea of Galilee, and the Healing of the Man who was Born Blind. The south wall contains the following scenes: the Healing of the Leper, the Raising of the Young Man, the Healing of the Woman of her Bloody Issue, the Raising of the Daughter of Jairus and the Raising of Lazarus from the Dead.The picture shows the first scene on the north wall: The Gerasene demoniac.

33456-19oldtet.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 521.The story of David and Bathsheba is in the Bible (II Sam. 11 :2-17). One evening while he walked on the roof of his palace David saw below him a beautiful woman bathing. This was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite who was then away on service in David's army. In an act of seigniorial arrogance he had her brought to the palace and made love to her. She became pregnant as a consequence. Later he wrote to Uriah's army commander saying, 'Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle . . . that he may be smitten and die.' This indeed came about and David afterwards married Bathsheba. The child survived only a few days. David subsequently did penance.Bathsheba is usually depicted at her toilet in various states of nudity. Earlier Renaissance artists show her clothed and merely washing her hands or feet, helped by attendants. Sometimes a messenger is shown arriving with a letter, though the Bible does not record this detail. David's morally indefensible conduct did not deter the medieval Church from drawing a typological parallel: he prefigured Christ and Bathsheba the Church.Rembrandt's painting shows Bathsheba as she receives the message of King David summoning her. The sculpture-like position of the woman is inspired by antique reliefs

08684-09deadph.jpg	This still-life was painted by the artist during his later years. In 1728 he was accepted as a painter of animals and fruit at the Paris Academy of Art without having to fulfil the usual requirements.The structure of this painting is simpler than in his earlier still-lifes, and Chardin has reduced the number of objects to a minimum. By singling out and thus monumentalizing the motif of the bird, Chardin gives it considerably more emphasis. According to the categories of feudal game law, the pheasant was seen as reserved for the nobility, but the hunting trophy which has been attached to the pheasant has, from a bourgeois point of view, lost its value of triumphantly demonstrating man's lordship over nature. However, the way in which the pheasant is rendered does not indicate in any way that colour is gradually becoming detached from the object. Rather, the careful, delicate application of the paint - even in the more roughened structures - heightens the element of sensitive empathy. Unlike the game still-lifes of his contemporaries - which have a smooth, cold objectiveness about them - the artist has created an atmosphere of intimacy between the viewer and the object.

34080-3renoi27.jpg	Renoir's change of direction between 1884 and 1887 was dictated by an individual approach. The spontaneity of Impressionism, as well as its traditional fondness for landscape, gave way to a gradual elaboration of composition that enabled Renoir to reexamine the problem of the nude in a landscape. For his Large Bathers, Renoir did a number of preliminary designs. Having been a Delacroix admirer in his early years, Renoir here seems to turn toward Ingres, and the way he neatly outlines his shapes places him in the context of the nude that in the 1890s was to preoccupy such artists as F�lix Valloton and Charles Maurin.Faced with criticism of his new style after completing The Large Bathers, an exhausted Renoir never again devoted such painstaking effort to a single work

43976-0seven.jpg	The subject of this triptych is the Seven Sacraments. Of the Christian sacraments - acts conferring grace - Protestants generally recognize two, Baptism and Communion, and the Catholics seven, which comprise, in addition, Confirmation, Penance (Confession), Extreme Unction, Holy Orders and Matrimony, the last two still being mutually exclusive. They are seen on medieval fonts and as altarpiece cycles in early Netherlandish painting, where the subject seems to have had greater appeal, at least until the 17th century. The triptych of Rogier van der Weyden is a good example of these altarpieces.We see an acuteness of observation in the Altar of the Sacraments. The Calvary sequence takes place in the interior of a light, spacious church, whose carefully executed details immediately catch the viewer's eye. The seven sacraments are presented around the central crucifixion group accompanied by an angel with a banderole. The importance of the action in the central panel is emphasised by the size of the depicted personages compared to the figures in the side panels. The emotion of the central characters - Saint John and the three Marys - who are overcome with grief, is a characteristic feature of Van der Weyden's art. It is thought that the triptych was commissioned in 1441 by the Bishop of Tournai, Jean Chevrot, for the altar of his private chapel. Van der Weyden portrays him on the left of the painting, as the bishop administering Confirmation.Van der Weyden was probably helped by his assistants during the execution of the Altar of the Sacraments

07328-angel.jpg	An Andalusian by birth and training, Alonso Cano, a painter, sculptor and architect, did most of his painting between 1638 and 1652, in Madrid, and later in Granada. This part of his career was divided between the execution of altarpieces and the portrayal of religious scenes revealing the highest qualities of an artist in love with beauty. In his conception of painting, Cano, a great creator of types, stands somewhere between Zurbar�n and Murillo. His frequently rounded forms are softened by lively and harmonious, but never strident colors. Strong lighting and vigorous composition give his figures, almost always religious, their distinctive plasticity.The most noteworthy of Cano's altarpieces are those in the church at Getafe (near Madrid), dating from 1645. From that time on, Cano's technique became increasingly pictorial, that is to say, increasingly Baroque, acquiring some of the subtleties he had previously ignored. Perhaps his most important painting is the Descent into Limbo (in the County Museum, Los Angeles), a strange, rather illustrative composition, anecdotal in the movement imparted to the figures, but including one of the rare, and one of the most beautiful, female nudes in Spanish art. His sense of drama finds its most intense expression in his Dead Christ Supported by an Angel, in the Prado. Cano's gifts as a landscape painter are apparent in a number of pictures with Biblical themes, for example in his Christ and the Woman of Samaria, in which the lights and darks have a strongly naturalistic effect.During his later years in Granada, Cano painted a number of other important works, like the Seven Mysteries of the Virgin, brilliantly colored canvases of monumental proportions painted between 1652 and 1664 for the main chapel of the Cathedral. Cano's foremost achievement is undoubtedly the series of Immaculate Conceptions painted at various times in his career, including a particularly fine one in the Provincial Museum at Vitoria, and another in the oratory of Granada cathedral. Fate has not been kind to Cano's paintings: several of the best have been destroyed in revolutions and wars

22651-0madonna.jpg	Lippi painted only a few devotional panels of the Madonna and Child, scarcely a dozen may be ascribed to him with confidence, yet each is a landmark in the genre. The present Madonna and Child at first seem slightly conservative - a throwback to Gothic practice in its flat, gilt haloes and elaborately tooled gold cloth of honour. Yet, the composition is based on a terracotta relief by Luca della Robbia. The parapet in front of the exquisitely refined figures, together with the shallow rectangular recess behind the gilt cloth, establishes the subtle and endlessly varied terms of Lippi's continuous dialogue between sculpture and painting on the one hand and between the illusionism of Renaissance painting and the ornamental qualities of Late Gothic painting on the other

00015-orpheus.jpg	King Francis I of France concentrated his patronage of art and artists on the decoration of the Chateau of Fontainebleau. To this and he imported such major artists as he could. He did get the aging Leonardo, he imported Rosso in 1530, Primaticcio in 1532, then Niccol&#242; dell'Abbate, Vignola, Andrea del Sarto, Cellini. Some stayed, some went back; but the work they left behind was decisive in the replacement of Gothic style in France.The Fontainebleau decorations included a Long Gallery, a Ballroom and several royal rooms. Only a fraction survives, since much were destroyed in later rebuildings, and most of the paintings were drastically restored in the nineteenth century.Niccol&#242; dell'Abbate arrived about 1552. His main contribution was his fantastic landscapes, which are a genre quite apart from from either the poetic realism found in late fifteenth-century Italian pictures, or the homely kind in the background of the Raphael cartoons. They have a dreamlike quality with extremes of light and colour, rainbows and flickering storms.

23530-undine.jpg	The subject is based on a moment in a romantic German novel entitled Undine, written by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu�, which was first translated into English in 1818 and became almost as popular with artists in England as Goethe's Faust. The incident painted by Maclise occurs in chapter IX, where the young knight, Huldbrand, accompanies his bride, Undine, back home through the forest. The priest, Father Heilmann, who has just performed the marriage ceremony, follows behind and is visible beneath the branch of the tree. Ahead is the dark and sinister apparition, Kuhleborn, the spirit of the waters and the uncle of Undine. Huldbrand draws his sword on Kuhleborn and then strikes him, whereupon the spirit of the waters is transformed into a waterfall. Clearly the painting illustrates the forces of good, represented by the newly married couple, overcoming the power of evil, symbolised by the looming figure of the water god. The narrative element of the picture is aligned on a diagonal, which is contained within a bower populated by elves, goblins and water-nymphs associated with the surrounding forest.The composition is a triumph of design with the main elements of the story formed by an ornamental border of considerable intricacy. Maclise used other such borders for several of his book illustrations including those for The Chimes by Charles Dickens of 1844 and Irish Melodies by Thomas Moore of 1845. Maclise has here relied on German sources for the decorative features, and was clearly influenced by German illustrators.Maclise was of Irish origin and in 1827 he came to London, where he almost immediately gained recognition as a portrait draughtsman, drawing numerous likenesses for Eraser's Magazine. He painted historical and literary subjects, several as frescoes for the Palace of Westminster. Maclise formed close friendships with the novelists Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray as well as his compatriot, the poet Thomas Moore, and the politician Benjamin Disraeli. With all of these he shared an ebullience of character and a sense of humour, but this later gave way to melancholy and pessimism.

29251-104muril.jpg	In his early pictures Murillo seems to have drawn the figures one by one, without attempting to unify the composition. But in the famous painting known as the Angels' Kitchen there is a greater narrative cohesion. Although the name of the protagonist is still somewhat uncertain, he may be the lay brother Francisco P�rez from the nearby town Alcal� de Guadaira, who spent thirty years as an assistant in the kitchen of the monastery San Francisco el Grande. According to the story he was much given to fervent prayer and one day became so lost in his devotions that he neglected his duties. Upon returning to consciousness, he was surprised to see that his chores had been miraculously accomplished.Murillo has embellished the legend with irresistibly charming details. Fray Francisco, who is bathed in an aura of golden light, floats above the ground in a mystical rapture. Next to him stand exquisitely painted angels, with richly coloured wings, while at the right putti and angels tackle the work of preparing the meal, grinding spices, stirring the hotpot, and setting the table in the midst of a delicious still-life of vegetables and cookware. Painted when the artist was approaching thirty years of age, this painting announces the arrival of a new talent and temper in Sevillian painting.

25225-saint.jpg	"Records of 1359 mention a house owned by Theoderic, painter to the emperor. Since he is later referred to as familiaris, Theoderic can be seen as closer than most artists to the court he served. In 1367 he was granted tax exemption for an estate in Morin which lay at the foot of Karlstein castle, and which had probably previously belonged to his predecessor at court, the Strasbourg painter Nikolaus Wurmser. This exemption from taxes was granted, it was explained, because Theoderic had created ""skilful and solemn paintings"" and had decorated the chapel in an ""inventive (including in the technical sense) and ingenious"" fashion. These words from the emperor's own lips were praise indeed. Yet it is unclear where Theoderic came from and where he trained. While Bohemian and Italian art form his starting-points, he seems to have absorbed certain influences from the German art of the day such as the sculpture of the Parler workshop, with its block-like character and monumental heaviness, which incorporates stylistic elements of 13th-century sculpture. Theoderic's art is in turn distinguished by its monumentality, its orientation towards the past, and its integration of various trends, including Italian, western European and Byzantine. In artistic terms, he thereby seems to have expressed precisely what the emperor wanted to say. From 1355 to 1375, painting in Bohemia was entirely under his sway"

30590-1sculptu.jpg	Very early in his career, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, considerably influenced by Luca Giordano, absorbed the examples of Magnasco and Sebastiano Ricci and turned his style towards a refined decorative freedom in airily elegant works of pure rococo taste; and through his stays in several European artistic centres London, D�sseldorf, The Hague, Antwerp, Paris, Prague Dresden and Vienna, his work gained a certain popularity. The 'Allegory of Sculpture' and the 'Allegory of Painting' belong to his last years. They are an interweaving of the lightest of figural rhythms, a coloured web of impalpable, rarified weightlessness, shot through with silvery transparencies which recall the pastels of the artist's sister-in-law, Rosalba Carriera.

20105-31hooch.jpg	In seventeenth-century Holland everyday life and its activities were seen as virtues and became popular subjects for works of art. Among these highly valued activities were the housewife's duties of nursing the children, cooking and cleaning the house, the street outside and the courtyard.In the present painting by Pieter de Hooch everything is spotless. Apart from a couple of hens pecking at the ground, all is calm, silent and harmonious. The young woman, probably a maidservant, stands motionless, a broom and a pail in her hands. Behind her, in the middle ground, is an open  gate in the fence which leads to the house; on the left another open door leads to a view of a landscape with high trees, the silhouette of a city and an expanse of blue water

21927-5benois1.jpg	Mary and her child are naturally engrossed in their game, and their gazes make them appear lifelike to a degree that can be found in no contemporary Italian painting of the Madonna. Leonardo achieved this quality by means of nature studies. In 1478, he noted that he was working on two Madonnas. The Benois Madonna can be dated to that period. The painting has in its present condition been overpainted in some places and has lost some of the paint layer.The painting was also called the Madonna Benois because of the family who owned it. This canvas demonstrates the newly developed  method of chiaroscuro - a lighting/shading technique that made the figures appear three dimensional. It entered the Hermitage in 1914

30511-christop.jpg	An influential painter in terms of the development of landscape painting in the 16th century was Joachim Patenier, who was born in Bouvignes, near Dinant. Like Quentin Massys, with whom he worked occasionally, he lived and worked in Antwerp. His contribution to the development of a new genre, the independent landscape painting, was considerable. In his religious paintings, he placed his figures against a background of immense vistas presented as a bird's eye view of a host of cosmic elements: mountains and crags, sweeping valleys, rivers and meadows, towns and villages - one after the other they draw the eye of the beholder on to a distant horizon. Although these are not yet fully independent landscape paintings, the landscape is the most important element in his compositions. The human figures play only a secondary role, as can be seen in St Christopher bearing the Christ Child, a very popular subject at that time and on into the 17th century, because St. Christopher was believed to give protection against sudden death. There can be no doubt that Pieter Bruegel studied Patenier's landscapes before leaving for Italy and painting the Alps

38946-09gesuat.jpg	The Virgin Mary hovers on a throne-like golden yellow cloud beneath a baldachin in front of Renaissance architecture, dressed in brilliant reds and blues and accompanied by angels. In the foreground are the three saints, all members of the Dominican order. Agnes of Montepulciano (1274-1317) sits at the front and meditates over a small crucifix. Her robes illusionistically jut out into the viewer's space. To her left stands St Catherine of Siena (1347-1380) with a crown of thorns and a crucifix, and St Rose of Lima (1586-1617), holding the Christ Child in her arms.The figures in this altarpiece are portrayed more as the heroines of noble dramas than as saints. They combine true pathos with elegant sensuality, as if they were creatures of some higher human species. At the same time, however, they are firmly linked to our sense of everyday life through the descriptive details which are so naturalistic as to border on trompe-l'oeil

02620-05arella.jpg	The pair of Basket of Flowers on a Plinth, signed and dated 1664, now in the same private collection, was executed when Arellano was at the height of his powers and exemplifies the decorative and stylistic characteristics of his art that made his works so sought after by collectors in the 17th century.Arellano was able to maintain the interest of his admirers by varying the formats of his pictures. In the case of these works, he transformed one of his most popular picture types, the basket of freshly picked flowers, by perching the basket on the edge of semi-ruined classical style entablatures that act as plinths. In creating this architectural fantasy, Arellano borrowed the motifs from the prints of the classical architectural orders of Marcantonio Raimondi (1475-1539), representing in one painting a simplified version of a Corinthian entablature and in the other, an even more simplified version of this, without its frieze. These architectural features enter the pictures from opposite sides, thus allowing the works to flank a central element in a decorative scheme, and endow them with certain grandeur. The combination of ruins and flowers in these paintings heralds a picture type that became particularly popular in the following century

32492-holy_fam.jpg	The Virgin leans gently towards her son to prop him up, as Joseph behind them, observes his family. As the saviour of humanity and new Adam, Jesus is clutching an apple, whereas Mary is holding a nosegay with lilies, the symbol of purity.From a compositional standpoint, this panel evokes other variations of this theme that Procaccini painted around the 1620s. In these works the figures occupy a compressed space and emerge from the darkness with great plastic force

17524-3adamev1.jpg	This theme occurs at least nine times in Gossart's painted and graphic oeuvre, but none of these renderings is dated. On grounds of style, however, the present painting would seem to have been undertaken after the Neptune and Amphitrite of 1516 (Berlin, Staatliche Museen) or the Hercules and Deinara of 1517 (Birmingham, Barber Institute of Fine Arts), and to have preceded the Adam and Eve dating from around 1525 (Berlin, Staatliche Museen). In general terms, as his career developed, Gossart evolved compositions of greater complexity characterised by a repertoire of contorted poses with exaggerated anatomy and a vivid treatment of chiaroscuro. At the same time his technique became altogether freer. The Adam and Eve in the Royal Collection may date from around 1520.Gossart refers to a number of prints for the poses of Adam and Eve: D�rer's Adam and Eve of 1504, Jacopo de' Barbari's Mars and Venus and Marcantonio Raimondi's Adam and Eve after Raphael. The pose of Eve is perhaps more specifically related to D�rer's engraving known as The Dream of the Doctor, particularly the upper part of the body. Gossart had visited Italy in 1508-9 and became a prime exponent of Northern Mannerism, a style that evolved principally from the cross-fertilisation of German and Italian art. Quite apart from the large scale of the painting, the prominence of the foreground figures is still further enhanced by the sudden drop down to the middle-ground, dominated by a fountain set in the Garden of Eden. Fanciful architecture of this kind is frequently found in Gossart's work. He was also a remarkably fine painter of the nude. The treatment of the musculature may not be to modern taste, but it was undoubtedly inspired by classical sculpture. The handling of the hair, especially Eve's long tresses, which may have influenced Milton, was a speciality of the artist.Supplementing the narrative of The Fall as recounted in the second and third chapters of Genesis is a certain amount of symbolism, which is illustrated in Gossart's work: the two trees represent the Tree of Life and the Tree of Good and Evil, while the plants in the immediate foreground (columbine and sea holly) probably symbolise the contrasting emotions of the fear of God and the lust experienced by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Adam wears an apron of leaves, but Eve is still technically naked. Gossart was concerned to paint an epitome of the theme and was therefore disposed to take liberties with the biblical text.This painting was presented by the States-General of Holland to Charles I in 1636. It was sold in 1650 after the death of Charles I, but was recovered at the time of the Restoration. It has been suggested that John Milton, who was appointed Latin Secretary to Cromwell's Council of State in 1649, may have seen the work before it was sold, since the description of Adam and Eve in Paradise Lost (Book 4, lines 300-18) is fairly close

14778-ascensio.jpg	Gambara's Ascension of Christ is painted on the entry fa�ade of the cathedral of Parma.In the Renaissance period the decoration of the church is frequently focused on the apse and the entrance wall. These terminal walls of extended interior spaces are visible from a great distance, catching visitors' attention. The decoration of the apse towers over the events of mass at the high altar; the decoration of the inside wall of the fa�ade serves as an admonition or reinforcement for the visitors as they leave the liturgical ceremony and the church. Large format in both places called for fundamental, weighty themes.Examples of large-scale painted apse recesses are common in the areas ruled by Venice but also in Emilia. A large-scale fresco in the apse vault or on an entrance fa�ade could appear to break open the surface of the wall to provide a vision of the heavens or a view of an historical event; alternatively, it could illusionistically extend the existing architecture and enliven it with holy figures. The illusionistic remodeling, carried out by Lattanzio Gambara on the interior fa�ade of the Romanesque cathedral in Parma, is very spectacular. A fictive triumphal arch, decorated with reliefs and statues, stands at the end of the aisle.Above it, at the height of the galleries in the nave, the wall seems to recede into the depth. An illusionistic platform results on which Christ's disciples are running about in agitation; Christ, depicted in an aureole of light, floats above an actual window that illuminates the space. The contrast with the rigid artistic world of the painted statues and reliefs makes the excited figures of the Ascension seem that much more real

44252-nieuwe2.jpg	When Delft painters depicted the tomb of William the Silent from various angles, they were often concerned with which of its sculptural figures fell into view. In this panel De Witte uses the columns, the curtain, and the narrow limits of view to focus attention upon the rear of the monument, which from this vantage point frames the bronze figure of Fame perched at the foot of the bier. The gentleman's red cape, his gesturing hand, and a beam of light draw attention to the martyred prince. Two boys and the man's attractive companion appear to absorb his words.Although this panel dates from a period when Gerard Houckgeest, Hendrick van Vliet, and de Witte were continuously discovering new views of the Delft church interiors and their monuments, it still stands out as an extraordinary invention.The painting is signed and dated lower right, on the column: E. De Witte A 1653

17803-707goya.jpg	Wellington is the only Englishman, and one of very few foreigners, to have had their portraits painted by Goya. As victor of the Battle of Salamanca, the Earl of Wellington and Lieutenant-General, as he then was, had liberated Madrid from the French, entering the city in August 1812, when he sat for Goya. He is shown with the decorations of three Orders, the Bath (topmost star), the Tower and Sword of Portugal (lower left), and San Fernando of Spain (lower right). The insignia of the Golden Fleece was probably added to the costume later in the month, and the uniform altered to an approximation of Wellington's dress uniform as general. Originally he had been painted wearing the oval Peninsular Medallion; Goya retouched the portrait two years later, when Wellington returned as ambassador to the restored King Ferdinand VII and the medallion had been replaced by the Military Gold Cross.Arthur Wellesley, first Duke of Wellington, 43 when the portrait was made and greying at the temples, looks out from above his medals with an alert and good-humoured air. Goya often gave his sitters an animated expression by showing them with their mouths slightly open; even the Queen of Spain, Mar�a Luisa, shows her teeth in a famous group portrait of 1800 - an unthinkable breach of etiquette in any earlier age. Here, the duke's short upper lip is drawn up over two large English front teeth, a 'speaking likeness'. He is unlikely to have been speaking to Goya, who was totally deaf as a result of an illness in 1792 and could communicate only in sign language and by writing.'He painted only in one session, sometimes of ten hours, but never in the [late] afternoon. The last touches for the better effect of a picture he gave at night, by artificial light', wrote Goya's son, Francisco Javier, in his biography of the artist. The liveliness of this portrait suggests it is painted from life (although it is doubtful that 'Senor Willington', as Goya called him, sat for the full ten hours). The glitter of the decorations, so much bolder than the highlights on the flesh or the catchlights in the eyes, equally suggests that they may have been touched up at night. We know that both uniform and decorations were altered by Goya after the first sitting.There are two known portraits in oils of Wellington by Goya, one large equestrian portrait (Apsley House, London) and this bust as well as two drawings. A third painting of Wellington with hat and cloak (National Gallery of Art, Washington) is no longer considered to be by Goya. All are related, but the order of their execution and their precise interrelations are difficult to determine. It has been suggested that the drawings may have been made in preparation for an etching that was never executed. The British Museum drawing, in which the head most closely resembles the head in the paintings, may, however, have served as a study for these. An inscription on this drawing says that it was a study for the equestrian portrait and an accompanying note (said to be in the hand either of Goya's grandson or of his friend Carderera), that it was made at Alba de Tormes after the Battle of Ar�piles (i.e. Salamanca). The battle was fought on 22 July 1812 and Wellington was at Alba de Tormes on the following day, but it is unlikely that he was able to sit to Goya before he entered Madrid on 12 August. The equestrian portrait, the only one for which documents exist, must have been painted between 12 August and 2 September, when it was to be exhibited in the Academy of San Fernando.The National Gallery painting was probably painted before he left Madrid on 1 September 1812, at the same time as the equestrian composition, when Wellington was still Earl of Wellington and Lieutenant-General. Of the two paintings, the head in the National Gallery version is the most animated and the most likely to have been taken from life. It is also the only one that represents Wellington in full military costume and the most ceremonial in appearance. Some of the decorations that he wears were received after he left Madrid in 1812 and the alterations that are visible in the painting may have been made in May 1814, when Wellington returned there as Ambassador to Ferdinand VII

18228-0409grec.jpg	The signature appears on the paper held in the mouth of a serpent (the spirit of evil, or of the Earth). The large painting was commissioned by Philip II, late 1570 or early 1580, for the chapel of the Saint in the church of the Escorial. The earliest reference is the King's order to the Prior, dated 25th April 1580 to provide the artist with materials, 'especially ultramarine', to enable him to carry out the commission given some time ago. El Greco had clearly already decided upon the dominant colour for the painting. The painting was completed by 16th November 1582, when it was delivered to the Escorial. The commission was probably prompted by the death of Navarrete in 1579, who left unfulfilled the greater part of his commission to provide paintings for the thirty-six altars of the church. The painting did not satisfy the King, Cincinato was commissioned to paint a substitute for the chapel and El Greco received no further commissions from the King.The story of St Maurice (a legendary warrior saint, the commander of the 'Theban Legion', Roman troops from Thebes in Egypt, who served at Agaunum in Gaul (St-Maurice en Valais) in the 3rd century) relates that the soldiers, at the instigation of Maurice, refused to participate in certain pagan rites. They were punished by the Emperor Maximian Herculeus first by decimation and finally by the wholesale massacre of the legion. Maurice and his fellow officers were executed in A.D. 287. The authenticity ot the story is debated.The subject of the martyrdom of the soldier Saint with his legions, for his refusal to worship the pagan gods. was appropriate for the Escorial, the real centre of the crusade for the Faith. This subject expresses the conviction of faith that inspired the crusade; the Allegory of the Holy League, the militant spirit of the crusade itself. The ecstatic character of this 'invitation to death' (Ortega y Gasset) is expressed. The physical side of the martyrdom is not emphasised, is no more than symbolised by the small group on the left comprising the one martyred figure, the figure, in the pose of his Christ of the Baptism, awaiting martyrdom and the grand figure in back-view of the executioner. The impression of the ranks of the Saint's army awaiting martyrdom is similar to that of the multitude in adoration in the Adoration of the Name of Jesus. The two paintings are related in composition, and in their expression of devotional fervour.The grand group of Saint Maurice and his companions owes much to the heroic figure style of Rome. There is however no emphasis on weight or volume. There is also no emphasis on spatial depth

05845-0altar.jpg	The central panel of the altarpiece is given over to The Last Supper. It is one of the key works in the history of Flemish art. Here, Bouts breaks with the tradition according to which Christ is always represented in the act of announcing the betrayal of Judas. Instead, he chooses to show the moment at which he institutes the Eucharist. On the four side panels are biblical episodes which prefigure the sacrament, namely: The Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek, The Gathering of the Manna, Elijah in the Desert and The Feast of the Passover. We know now that this innovation was not accidental. Two professors of theology at Leuven University, Master Jan Varenecker and Master Aegidius Ballawel, were asked to provide the painter with precise instructions as to the subjects he should represent.The four scenes depicted on the side panels are drawn from the Old Testament, and are more plainly narrative in character. They set small figures within vast natural landscapes. Only Elijah in the desert and the angel who bends over him with his enormous wings come anywhere near the monumental scale of the central panel

23224-annuncia.jpg	This painting, signed and dated 1371, is the central panel of a polyptych. Here we can see clearly how Lorenzo Veneziano, in his mature work moved increasingly towards the musical expressiveness of colour shot through with Gothic accents. The iconographical scheme of this Annunciation is radically different from that of the Lion polyptych. The figures of the Virgin and the herald angel inhabit the space of the picture in a much more substantial sense, are in much solider bodily contact with the grass and flowers. Indeed this is the first example in Venice of a naturalistic motif which was dear to the hearts of the refined artists working in the International Gothic style. This style too is exemplified in the elaborate linear cadences and the way the figures are presented in curving compositional rhythms

19677-rarities.jpg	Jan van der Heyden was one of the leading architectural painters of his generation and a man of more parts than most Dutch painters. When he was a boy of thirteen his parents settled in Amsterdam; apart from trips to the Rhineland, the northern, and the southern Netherlands he spent his life there. He painted some imaginary cityscapes based on studies done in Germany, which at first blush appear to be true-to-life views, and lovely capriccios which show expert knowledge of the principles of classical architecture. His oeuvre also includes about forty landscapes that reveal a debt to Adriaen van de Velde, who is credited with painting figures in some of his pictures, and a few intriguing still-lifes that can be justifiably categorized as interiors. Van der Heyden is best known for his views of Amsterdam.Most of van der Heyden's paintings were done in the sixties and seventies - his work as inventor, entrepreneur, and city official probably slacked his pace. But he continued to paint until the very end. His latest firmly datable picture, Still-life with Rarities, now in Budapest, shows the corner of a 'Kunstkamer' in strong even light with meticulous depictions of rarities from the natural and man-made world, but not the collector who assembled them. It is proudly inscribed with his monogram and states he painted it when he was seventy-five years old; he attained that age in 1712, the year he died.Among the objects displayed in the Kunstkamer, which is most probably a fictive one, are a hanging armour of an armadillo, a copy after an etching of Pietro Testa's Suicide of Dido above the marble mantle, an inlaid cabinet used for housing treasured coins and natural specimens, oriental weapons, and on the bright red Chinese embroidered cloth that covers the table globes, one terrestrial and the other celestial, and an open Blaeu atlas. Next to the table there is a red damask covered chair that supports a folio Bible open at the favourite passage of Dutch moralists: Ecclesiastes, Chapter I, which begins with 'The words of the Preacher . . . vanity of vanities; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?' The biblical reference to transience is reinforced by Testa's Suicide of Dido, a subject taken from Virgil's Aeneid which can be read as an exemplum of love's ephemeral nature.Van der Heyden's message is obvious and familiar. It is one we have heard from other still-life specialists: preparation for salvation is of greater importance than all the treasures, pleasures, and knowledge that can be derived from this world

This reference is no coincidence.

09649-01barber.jpg	The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the Salone in the Palazzo Barberini. It depicts the Triumph of Divina Providentia - Apotheosis of the House of Barberini and the Papacy of Urban VIII.It was the decision of Pope Urban VIII to assign the task of painting the Salone to Pietro da Cortona, who was formally commissioned by Francesco Barberini, the nephew of Urban VIII. The allegorization of the pope and his reign is the dominant idea in the painting of the Salone, the large hall that forms the public centre of the palace. The divinely ordained rule of Urban VIII and the apotheosis of his Tuscan family whose roots could be traced back to antiquity, are cleverly incorporated into a timeless and universal perspective by Pietro da Cortona.The ceiling vault depicts the Triumph of Divina Providentia - Apotheosis of the House of Barberini and the Papacy of Urban VIII. To study the four compartments of the vault with their teeming figures it is necessary, after beginning with the centre, to change one's position four times. The best view of the centre of the ceiling is from the oval vestibule that served as an entryway. From there the triumphant personification of Divina Providentia appears to crown a pyramidal structure. The four frieze-like panels of the side walls present a compositional unity for the pictorial program.The Palazzo Barberini, residence of the papal family Barberini, set a new standard for Roman palace architecture and its painted decoration. It can be stated that Cortona's ceiling is the key work in Baroque ceiling painting

24038-1sposi1.jpg	In their attempts to interpret the group portrait on the north (fireplace) wall, commonly referred as La Corte dei Gonzaga (The Court of Gonzaga), a number of scholars have sought to identify it as a specific historical event, much as they have the one on the west wall, conventionally called L'Incontro (The Meeting). However, there is no indication in the paintings themselves that these are crucial events, no hint of their historical significance, something that may have been incorporated into the background. Therefore increasing numbers of scholars have tended to doubt that the pictures represent actual historical events.The identity of some of the portraits has been clarified based on existing documents. The girls beside the marchesa are her two daughters Paola and Barbara. Ludovico Gonzaga is seated on a chair by the left pilaster. He turns to the side to speak with a man who has just entered from the left. To Gonzaga's right sits his wife, Barbara von Hohenzollern-Brandenburg, surrounded by her sons and daughters, a nurse, and a female dwarf. Beneath the right arcade, which is closed by a curtain that is drawn aside only slightly at the outside corner, stand a number of noblemen in elegant and colourful costumes. This procession of courtiers, identified by the colours of their leggings as adherents of the Gonzaga, is led by a young blond man who, like the presumed secretary at the left edge of the picture, stands in front of the painted pilaster. He is flanked by associates who are in part obscured by the same pilaster. The blond youth with a dagger at his waist was identified as Rodolfo Gonzaga.Although many scholars tried to identify the figures in the painting, the only ones that can be considered confirmed are those of the marchese's immediate family

Evidence of this are the portraits commissioned from him by artists, like this double portrait of Frans Snyders, a painter of animals and still-lifes, and his wife Margaretha de Vos.The depiction of both spouses on a single panel makes it possible to portray a more intimate relationship, and this was the format that Anthony van Dyck tended to prefer, especially for his fellow artists.

41316-02cruci0.jpg	This painting, one of the oldest in the Uffizi, was for many years given a general attribution to the Italian school of the twelfth century. Later, a close study of the clear, bright colours used in the small stories revealed the influence of miniature painting and the Byzantine taste of the composition, although with personal touches in the amusing narration which in places verges on the grotesque. The work is seen as significant evidence of the early influence of Pisan-Oriental art in Florence.The painting follows the Western iconographic formula of Christus triumphans. In the scenes of the Passion the artist has emphasized the most essential and dramatic moment of the action which unfolds itself in a single rapid movement of an expressionistic and popular tone.

42977-2music2.jpg	This tondo belongs to a series of 21 such circular pictures adorning the ceiling of the great room of the Libreria Vecchia. Sansovino and Titian awarded the work a golden chain as the best painting, the chain being later recorded in the estate of Veronese's heirs. The Libreria Vecchia housed not only reading and lecture rooms but also the offices of the procurators. It is not known whether a specific program and defined sequence underlay the decoration. Even the iconography of most of the pictures throws up puzzles.Corresponding to the purpose of the room and function of the building, the pictures illustrate allegories of education, the arts and sciences. Contemporary commentators related the decoration to the good conduct of government and its foundations, which required not just a virtuous, but also an erudite ruler.

37985-cowes.jpg	Whistler's followers included Theodore Roussel, Paul Maitland, Walter Richard Sickert and the young Philip Wilson Steer - that is, the artists widely considered the leading British Impressionists. With Sidney Starr they split off from the New English Art Club. This sub-group used the label London Impressionists. The driving force was Sickert who outlined the task facing British Impressionism: to record the magic and poesy that lay all around in everyday life. London, the great metropolis, provided all the stimulating subject-matter that was necessary.Like many other English painter of his generation, Philip Wilson Steer, who enrolled at the Acad�mie Julian in Paris in 1882, was initially under the sway of Bastien-Lepage. back in England, he settled in London, and from 1884 tended to paint at Walberswick on the Suffolk coast. There he painted fresh, outstanding pictures, which he showed at the first London Impressionists exhibition. The fluid style echoed Whistler, while Steer's pastose brushwork (or, indeed, palette knife work) sometimes recalled Courbet or Manet. Subsequently Steer, under the growing influence of French Impressionism, lightened his colours to the point of luminosity, using a technique if visibly separate brush-strokes reminiscent of Monet's boat pictures at Argenteuil

25912-stimelon.jpg	Luis Egidio Mel�ndez is the most important Spanish still-life painter of the 18th century. He saw his bodegones as part of an ambitious project. In a petition addressed to King Charles III in 1772, he wrote that he was planning a series of paintings for a cabinet that would illustrate all the different foodstuffs produced by the Spanish climate over the four seasons in the four elements. Up to this point he had only finished those showing the fruits of the earth. He had the means neither to continue the project, however, nor indeed to feed himself.It seems somewhat unlikely that Mel�ndez planned his still-lifes as a coherent programme right from the outset; rather, he must have arrived at this idea as time went by and he found himself in possession of a sizeable stock of unsold pictures of food and household utensils. During these years he supplied 44 still-lifes to Prince Carlos of Asturia, the later King Charles IV. The paintings went first to the newly built Casita del Pr�ncipe, a country villa near the Escorial de Abajo. Around 1800 they hung in the dining room in the royal palace in Aranjuez

43600-03diana.jpg	Signed and dated on the quiver in the lower right corner: Simon Vouet F. Paris 1637 (the date has previously been incorrectly read as 1627).The artist had been a leading painter in Rome and in 1624 was elected President of the Accademia di San Luca. His style there oscillated between the Caravaggesque, Roman baroque and Bolognese classicism. On his return to Paris he gained a reputation as a decorative artist, indulging in skilful displays of illusionistic painting including the ceiling of the principal room in the ch&#226;teau at Colombes where Henrietta Maria (the wife of Charles I) lived from 1657. Vouet was undoubtedly the most influential artist of his generation in France (beside Poussin who spent much of his life in Rome) and was active in establishing the Acad�mie des Beaux-Arts in 1648, one year before his death.Diana is in Vouet's late, more classical style. The idealised expression of the face with its widely spaced features, the languid gesture, and the slow, ponderous rhythms combined with the pale flesh tones and light colours of the drapery are typical of the artist's decorative work. The composition was originally oval, as seen in an engraving of 1638 by Vouet's son-in-law, Michel Dorigny. With this knowledge the internal rhythms of the painting become more comprehensible, with the curve created by the reclining figure of the goddess of hunting continued in the muzzles of the two dogs pointing in opposite directions.Dorigny also engraved two other oval compositions in 1638, Venus and Adonis and Mars and Venus, which could have formed a series with the present painting. The pose is reminiscent of Venetian painting (for example, Venus and Cupid by Palma Vecchio - Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum). Vouet had visited Venice in 1612/13, but evidence of his interest in Venetian art resurfaces in several of the decorative schemes undertaken after 1627, especially in his masterpiece in the Hotel Seguier, Paris. There is also an affinity with Primaticcio's work carried out at Fontainebleau for Francis I at the beginning of the sixteenth century, which was widely known through engravings

32811-38lamb.jpg	This small picture for private devotion belongs to Raphael's years in Florence, after he had moved from Umbria but before he went to Rome. There he was keen to absorb the style particularly of Leonardo, and of other artists such as the young Michelangelo. But the miniaturist delicacy and serenity of this work recall his early formation under the influence of the Umbrian master Perugino, and there is definitely also a knowledge of Netherlandish painting, particularly clear in the landscape.There are several versions of this picture, which all show the Virgin holding Christ riding on a lamb while the elderly Joseph presides over the family. This version, in Madrid, was later marked with the words RAPHAEL URBINAS MDVII on the Virgin's d�collet�. As Pedretti has pointed out, the version in Vaduz is dated 1504, and signed, so that it may be considered the original

17988-11scene.jpg	"Benozzo connected the small lunette above the window to the Stigmatisation of St Francis on the right south wall. The lunette shows the winged Cross floating over a rock formation. Rays emanate from the Cross surrounded by seraphs; they converge on the bordering picture field and the kneeling saint whose hands are raised. It is the five wounds of Christ that St Francis is receiving. Due to the chosen sequence of the scenes, the stigmatisation is given particular prominence. The rays do not hit the saint directly, as they change their direction while en route.Receiving the stigmata was the most important event in the life of the saint and happened in 1224 on the mountain of La Verna in Tuscany. Gozzoli has depicted this scene across two wall fields: the direction in which Francis and the sitting monk are looking, as well as the cluster of rays, lead us across to a second picture field above the central lunette of the choir, which is bordered by the window jamb. Here the Crucifix and seraphs appear, surrounded by a shining mandorla.The inscription reads: QUANDO BEATUS FRA(N)CISCUS IN MO(NTE) ALVERNE RECEPIT STIGMATA YHV XRI - ""How St Francis received the wounds of Jesus Christ on the mountain of La Verna."

It is considered to be a workshop production.In the paintings attributed to this master, the principal figure, passive and occupying a large part of the picture space, is contrasted with other more dynamic figures: putti in the Triumph, servants in the Birth and children in the Abundance. As in the work of Nicolo dell'Abate, but in a more anecdotal way, nature is very much present, particularly in the flowers strewn around in such profusion that they could almost be seen as the signature of the artist

24610-moneylen.jpg	To a certain degree in opposition to the Romanists amongst his contemporaries, Massys held fast to the traditions established by Early Netherlandish art. Italian influences, to which he was only indirectly exposed, nevertheless make themselves felt in the monumentalization of his figures.The Money-changer and his Wife is an early example of the genre painting which would flourish in Flanders and the northern Netherlands over the course of the 16th century. Seated behind the table, and each sliced on one side by the frame, the figures are set back from the front edge of the painting. Although sophisticated in their nuances of colour, the faces wear an expression of relative indifference. Full of their own life, on the other hand, are the still-life details - the lavishly illuminated codex through which the wife is leafing, the angled mirror, which reflects the outer world into the picture in masterly foreshortening, and the glass, accessories and coins gleaming on the table and on the shelves against the far wall. In the dominant role which it grants to these objects, the painting marks an important step along the path towards the pure still life.By inserting his own likeness into the painting - reflected in the convex mirror Massys recalls the use of this device by Jan van Eyck in The Arnolfini Marriage of 1434.There exists several, partly different copies of the painting

15589-07tornab.jpg	"Ghirlandaio incorporated portraits of his contemporaries in many biblical scenes. It is probably for precisely that reason that he was so popular among the rich Florentines, who were particularly keen on self portrayal. This makes it all the more astonishing that so few secular portraits by Ghirlandaio have survived.There are two paintings dating from about 1490, in the Paris Mus�e du Louvre and in Madrid, that are masterpieces of his art and yet fundamentally different: Giovanna Tornabuoni is idealized to the extent of becoming an ""icon"" of beauty for young Florentine girls, while the old man with the boy is painted with a pitiless degree of realism. Ghirlandaio does not shrink even from depicting his nose in all its disfigurement.The painting in Madrid depicts Giovanna degli Albizzi in a magnificent garment made of gold brocade with tight, slitted silk sleeves. She came from one of the most important Florentine families and in 1486 married Lorenzo Tornabuoni. After her early death Ghirlandaio created two portraits, and it is possible that he was able to produce the cartoon for them while she was still alive.In a fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel, Giovanna is depicted as an entire figure witnessing the Visitation. The artist used that portrait in his panel painting with a new background, though he unfortunately cut the arms and hands off rather awkwardly. The delightful young woman now stands out, in a clear contrast of light against dark, from the black niche in the background. The reserved beauty of the young woman is fittingly expressed in the formal clarity of the composition.She is wearing a valuable piece of jewelry, comprising a ruby in a gold setting with three silky shining pearls, hanging from her neck by a delicate cord. There is a very similar item of jewelry on the shelf behind her, and this, combined with red coral beads against the black background, gives the work a noble elegance. These beads are part of a rosary, and the section that is hanging straight down emphasizes the vertical line of her back, and also directs our gaze to the prayer book. Between these two ""pious"" objects is a little note alluding to the beautiful soul of the portrayed woman by means of an epigram written by the Roman poet Martial in the first century A.D.: Ars utinam mores animumque effigere posses pulchrior in terris nulla tabella foret. (Art, if only you could portray mores and spirit, there would be no more beautiful picture on earth).This outstanding portrait, one of the most famous of the Quattrocento, makes it clear that portraits of women were one of Ghirlandaio's ideal subjects"

31392-paolina1.jpg	"Between 1542 and 1548 Pope Paul III transformed a series of rooms on the two upper levels of the Castel Sant'Angelo into a comfortable and at the same time impressive apartment. Time and again this castle had provided protection to popes against the incursions of secular powers, and it continued to have a military function. His predecessors had commissioned various decorations, although these have been lost. The newly decorated rooms were to provide leisure and spiritual rest - the typical purpose of a country house or villa. The mythological subjects with which some of the rooms were painted thus correspond to what one would expect in a villa, but hardly in papal apartments.The largest room of these apartments, the great hall today called the Sala Paolina after the pope who commissioned it, surprises the visitor with its festive exuberance. Most important is the impression of the whole which presents itself to the eye and aims to overpower visitors to the room with the sheer display of riches, splendour, and bounty. This impression is the  result of the decorative system designed by Perino del Vaga.The seemingly plastic organization of the walls features bronze chiaroscuri framed in stone; round-headed niches flanked by columns, with ""living"" figures of the Virtues; overdoor paintings with female personifications; and pairs of putti holding bronze tondi. The plastic organization of the walls enters into competition with the fully plastic, partially gilded stucco of the ceiling and its colourful paintings.The six ceiling paintings and the large wall areas were reserved for scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, while the act of Apostle Paul - from his conversion to martyrdom - were depicted in the six tondi above the doors of the room. The selection of these two protagonists was clearly intended to play on the two names of the pope (Alessandro Farnese having become Paul III).Perino del Vaga painted just a part of the frescoes, the other parts being done by collaborators following his cartoons. Marco Pino from Siena, a student of Beccafumi, painted the six Alexander scenes on the vault.1. Alexander the Great before the High Priest2. Alexander the Great in the Temple of Jerusalem3. Alexander the Great Burns His Own Train4. Alexander the Great Battles the Indian King Porus5. Alexander the Great Has Ships Built6. Alexander the Great's Entry into Babylon.The picture shows the first scene of the Alexander cycle, which starts on the vault above the Archangel Michael: Alexander the Great before the High Priest. The scene depicts Alexander the Great meeting the high priest of Israel before the gates of Jerusalem. This ancient event served to illustrate the supremacy of ecclesiastical over secular authority. The theme of the subordination of secular rulers to spiritual authority was naturally suited to papal residences"

31239-montefe7.jpg	The Montefeltro family in Urbino was Piero's most generous patron towards 1465. The diptich with the portraits of Battista Sforza and Federico da Montefeltro can be dated at the beginning of this period. In these two relatively small panels Piero attempts a very difficult compositional construction, that had never been attempted before. Behind the profile portrait of the two rulers, which is iconographically related to the heraldic tradition of medallion portraits, the artist adds an extraordinary landscape that extends so far that its boundaries are lost in the misty distance. Yet the relationship between the landscape and the portraits in the foreground is very close, also in meaning: for the portraits, with the imposing hieratic profiles, dominate the painting just as the power of the rulers portrayed dominates over the expanse of their territories. The daringness of the composition lies in this sudden switch between such distant perspective planes.Piero's ability in rendering volumes is accompanied by his attention to detail. Through his use of light, he gives us a miniaturistic description of Sforza's jewels, of the wrinkles, moles and blemishes on Federico's olive-coloured skin

The technique probably derives from the work of Hendrick Goltzius, but for the Mannerist painter it was a bravura demonstration of technical virtuosity, a means of astounding his viewers with his extraordinary dexterity, while for Willem van de Velde the Elder, it was more a means to an end.

12271-verso15.jpg	The picture shows one of the 26 narrative scenes from the Stories of the Passion on the reverse side of the Maest&#224;. It is situated in the upper row on the left side above the scene of Christ Before King Herod.Pilate, on learning that Jesus belonged to the jurisdiction of Herod, sent the prisoner to the king to be judged by him. After questioning Jesus and treating him with ridicule and contempt, Herod sent him back to the Roman governor dressed in a conspicuous garment, the white robe that distinguished lunatics. Action proceeds from the bottom upwards; in the lower scene a servant is holding out to Christ the robe which in the upper scene he is already wearing.Although placed in different architectural surroundings (the governor's palace present in the last compartment on the lower row appears again), the arrangement of the two scenes is almost identical, both in the distribution of the characters and in their movements. Christ, gazing with extreme sadness at the onlooker, is withdrawn in total silence.

39670-09magdal.jpg	In 1561 Titian executed a painting of Mary Magdalen for Philip II, king of Spain. It is lost but several other compositions, based on this painting, survived; probably the best version is that in the Hermitage. This painting is signed on the rock on the left side. In his final period Titian handled his various versions of the Penitent Mary Magdalene with a dramatic intensity. This is particularly evident in a comparison of the St Petersburg canvas &#151; considered the prototype for the series &#151; with the early Mary Magdalene (in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence) painted for the Duke of Urbino in 1533.Despite the religious subject matter, there is a strong erotic quality in this picture of Mary Magdalene, who has sunk down in a posture of pious penitence, tears in her eyes as she gazes up to heaven. In contrast to the version painted for Francesco Maria della Rovere (now in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence), in this version her breasts are covered, but the extremely skimpy covering is if anything more provocative.The painting was kept by Titian, and remained in his own house until he died. In 1581 his son Pomponio sold his entire remaining works to Cristoforo Barbarigo. In 1850, the Barbarigo collection was moved to the Hermitage. The work is particularly impressive because of the beauty of the colours and the wonderful play of the light - Titian depicts the changes of colour it creates right down to the shadows cast on Magdalene's breast by the cloth

39559-pasture.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.This is an early work by Tivoli, who was to become the 'spiritual' leader of the Macchiaioli movement. The artist, who later spent nearly two decades in Paris, seems already to have absorbed the influence of the French Barbizon School, combining its themes with Tuscan landscape traditions characterized by simplicity of topic and atmospheric effects. Earthy colours and solid structure of composition are the dominating elements in this pastoral scene

07937-dead_chr.jpg	In this Lamentation, a late work executed in 1606, Carracci has achieved a degree of monumentality in his narration of an episode from the Passion of Christ that certainly bears comparison with Caravaggio's Entombment in the Vatican. As in the work of the Lombard artist, it is a profound sense of gravity that determines the character of the composition here. None of the figures, not even the woman standing in the centre, is fully upright. Stooping, she stretches her arms out towards Mary, who has fallen backwards in a swoon. The composition is structured by the portrayal of reclining, crouching, bent and stooping positions and by the unusual motif of the three figures in staggered graduation behind one another. The upper edge of the painting seems to be drawn down low so that not one of the figures is able to stand in an upright full-length position. All of this contributes towards conveying the gravity and heaviness of the dead Christ, not only physically, but also psychologically: the view of Christ's dead body does not call for an upright statuary figure as in a memorial, but seeks an equivalent to the deep sense of melancholy, as expressed in the gestures and body language of the grieving women.Other compositional devices would also suggest that the artist intended to trigger a similar mood in the spectator. The grouping of the figures can hardly be called beautiful or harmonious. A deep rift has been torn between the two Marys with the dead Christ and the two mourners, and although the body of Christ is the common bond between the mourning women, he is also presented as an isolated figure in the eyes of the spectator. The pallor of his body stands out against the full and heavy colority of the robes and the gloomy silhouette of the tomb

42121-05vecchi.jpg	Giorgio Vasari and assistants decorated the ceiling of the Sala di Cosimo il Vecchio in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. In the centre the scene of Cosimo's Return from Exile in 1434 is depicted, while other episodes from the life of Cosimo the Elder are around.The decoration of large halls with the deeds of the nobility and their ancestors was intended to inspire the viewer's admiration. The depiction of such events from the recent past has a long tradition. Most such cycles in the first half of the sixteenth century, however, are dedicated to a single person or event. By contrast, from the middle of the century onward this genre was increasingly devoted to the representation of dynasties. The first steps in this direction were taken by a family that did not belonged to the old aristocracy, but knew enough to exploit skillfully the memory of its ancestors for propaganda purposes - namely the Medici in Florence during the years of that city's transition from a republic to a principate. Duke Cosimo I openly exploited the depiction of the history of the older Medici in the Palazzo Vecchio to justify his own position. This decoration occupied Vasari and his workshop from 1556 to 1571, with interruptions, and its final version comprised more than a hundred individual depictions of historical themes

15779-reverse.jpg	Illusionist, deceiving effects were intended by a number of 17th-century Dutch still-life painters with their 'paintings of paintings' where e.g. a curtain, draped aside, seems to be hanging in front of a painting. This genre of still-life was known as a 'betriegertje (little trickster).Gijsbrechts' betriegertje is meant to lead the viewer astray by thinking that he ought to turn the picture the right way round. The scrap of paper with the number 36 on it gives the impression that this deceptive illusionist painting is actually meant for sale. It is therefore likely that the painting was originally put up at a sales exhibition as a practical joke. The salability which is associated with the picture probably also explains why it appears so abstract. At first sight, the painting certainly seems modern to today's viewer. However, it is not an abstract painting like Malevich's two-dimensional Suprematist colour configurations. The accurate rendering of the stretching frame and its borders, as well as the canvas, show that the basic intention is totally different: it is meant to emphasize plasticity, thus functioning as a substitute for a real object

22378-oratory.jpg	The Oratorio di San Giovanni Decollato in Rome houses the most important fresco cycle executed in the difficult decades after he Sack of Rome. It was commissioned by the Florentine confraternity of the Misericordia, founded in 1488, whose members had set themselves the task of helping those sentenced to death by providing them with spiritual support. Shortly after its founding the confraternity began the construction of the church and oratory next door. The completion of the church was delayed until 1553. By around 1536, on the other hand, the oratory had been completed to the extent that the painted decoration of the room could begin.The subject chosen for the fresco cycle, which covers the upper half of all four walls, was the story of the patron saint of the brotherhood, John the Baptist. For the execution of the cycle they selected Florentine (or Tuscan) artists working in Rome at the time. The most renowned Florentine painter active in Rome was Perino del Vaga, and several preparatory drawings for the frescoes by him have been preserved. Perino's designs were executed by younger Florentine artists, Jacopino del Conte and Cecchino (Francesco) del Salviati. Pirro Ligorio also contributed to the decoration, he painted on the left wall the Feast of Herod with the Dance of Salome

44754-agatha.jpg	Born in Catania, Sicily, at the foot of Mount Etna, Agatha decided to remain a virgin and dedicate her life to Christ. The Prefect of Sicily, Quintian, hearing of her great beauty, tried to seduce her. Faced with her rejection, he sent her into a brothel, but even there she miraculously preserved her virgin state. She was then subjected to a singularly cruel torture. She was attached head down to a column, and her breasts twisted or torn off with a pair of pincers. The next day, St Peter visited her in her dungeon and healed her wounds. She was then brought before a court and hauled over hot coals until she died, crying out her thanks to God.Protector of Sicily, Agatha is invoked against the eruption of Etna and other volcanoes, as well as against lightning, fires and earthquakes. Her cult quickly gained the mainland and is strong in central and northern Italy (Cremona, for example) and as far as eastern France, Germany and Spain, where she protects against fire.

07628-77tooth.jpg	This painting presents a plebeian and vulgar aspect of Caravaggio that we encounter in his life but not in his works. Consequently, the proposed attribution of this painting to Caravaggio met with much opposition. It must be pointed out, however, that even in the painting's unsatisfactory state of preservation (it was restored in an incompetent and harmful way, making it more difficult to study) an original quality of execution transpires that corresponds to the epitomized achievements of the late Caravaggio. It is also to be thought that there must have been a prototype, as so many of the works of Caravaggio's followers deal with this type of genre scene. The presence of a prototype in Naples would help explain some of the returns to this theme, including the late and striking works of the 18th century Neapolitan painter, Gaspare Traversi.The attribution of this painting to Caravaggio is not unanimous

03617-90madonn.jpg	Art historians have dated this unfinished work to between the late 1530's and the early 1540's on the basis of close stylistic correspondences between it and the Nativity of the Virgin (now in the Pinacoteca in Siena), one of Beccafumi's most famous paintings. The connections between this painting and the influence of Leonardo da Vinci have been pointed out. In the seventeenth-century Barberini art inventories it was listed as a Madonna Lactans alternately attributed to Leonardo or to one of his followers, an error that indicates the importance of Leonardo as an influence on Beccafumi. The correct attribution appears only in the nineteenth-century inventories (1817)

34149-captain.jpg	Joshua Reynolds, third son and seventh child of the Reverend Samuel Reynolds, was apprenticed at seventeen in London to the portrait painter Thomas Hudson, a Devonshire man like himself. Despite the uninspired example of Hudson, Reynolds succeeded in his ambition to become no 'ordinary' craftsman-painter: he established himself as a fashionable portrait painter, became friends with the most eminent men of letters in England, first president of the newly formed Royal Academy in 1768, and was knighted in 1769. Although he did not achieve greatness as a 'history painter', he invested his innumerable portraits of the privileged men and women of English society with the wit, poetic resonance and nobility of heroic narrative. His fifteen Discourses on Art, delivered at the Academy between 1769 and 1790, remain the most cogent and most moving tribute in English to the ideals of Western art grounded in the Italian Renaissance.We now tend to prefer the fresher brush of his rival Gainsborough to Reynolds's contrivances. A restless and indiscriminate experimenter with media and pigments, imitating the surface effects of Old Master paintings without an understanding of their methods, he saw his pictures fade, flake and crack, so that portraits 'died' before their sitters. Even his contemporaries protested at his technical shortcomings. Yet the more we look at Reynolds, in the prodigious variety which Gainsborough rightly envied, the more we see that he indeed achieved what he defined as 'that one great idea, which gives to painting its true dignity...of speaking to the heart'. More than any English painter before him, in the 'great design' of 'captivating the imagination', Reynolds participated in 'that friendly intercourse which ought to exist among Artists, of receiving from the dead and giving to the living, and perhaps to those who are yet unborn' (Discourse Twelve).Captain Robert Orme is one of the great romantic military portraits, painted soon after Reynolds established his London practice. When it was exhibited in 1761 at the Society of Artists, a visitor described it as 'an officer of the [Coldstream] Guards with a letter in his hand, ready to mount his horse with all that fire mixed with rage that war and the love of his country can give'. The sitter, Robert Orme (1725-90), served in America as aide-de-camp to General Braddock. When Braddock was killed in 1755 in an ambush by the French, Orme returned to England and resigned from the army. Some time in 1756 he sat for Reynolds.Orme never purchased the portrait from the artist, in whose studio it attracted much notice 'by its boldness and singularity'. The composition may be freely adapted from drawings of Italian frescoes and Roman sculpture brought back by Reynolds from his journey to Italy in 1750-2; it may also allude to a portrait of Charles I by Van Dyck, now in Paris. But the effect is splendidly dramatic and immediate: the thunderous sky and extravagant lighting, Orme's windswept hair, the highlighted despatches in his hand, his foaming steed, the red coat pushed open by the ready sword - all suggest a heroic and transient moment in the life of the young officer

03978-bello206.jpg	Bernardo Bellotto's views of Dresden demonstrate astonishing precision both in their topographical detailing and their mastery of perspective. Such precision has frequently been attributed to the use of a camera obscura. Bellotto's paintings allow the viewer to walk around the city; the various locations of his vedute complement each other and forever provide new angles on already familiar sights.This painting is part of an exceptional series of views of Dresden commissioned by the Elector of Saxony. A number of things are of interest: the large size of the paintings; the unfailingly splendid light; the clarity of the views; and finally the variety of different angles from which Bellotto framed the city. They supply fascinating views of a great Baroque city in its prime. The subject and composition seem particularly unusual in this view. The Zwinger, one of the masterpieces of Baroque architecture, has been placed to one side where it is obscured by trees; indeed, buildings only occupy a small amount of the picture's centre, for the focus of the composition is the moat.

17136-arles58.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 451, JH 1629.Van Gogh has painted an autumnal scene of sowing. The motif of the peasant sowing had fascinated him since his earliest months as an artist. In 1880-81 he had made many copies of an etching he owned after one of the most famous paintings of a sower by Jean Fran�ois Millet, as well as composing his own drawings of the theme by posing local Brabant models as sowers. He returned to the subject in June 1888 when he painted a landscape with a small figure of a sower in a field, dominated by a huge sun. In letters written in June he referred directly to Millet's Sower but he complained that it lacked colour. It was one of van Gogh's aims to correct this, in a sense to update the subject Millet had made so famous, and which was for van Gogh so resonant, by repainting the motif using modern colour theory. The canvas was planned in yellows and violets, though it did not finally conform to that scheme.In the autumn he resumed The Sower, making two paintings, of which this one is a smaller and probably later version. He has used violet and yellow. The appeal of the sower motif for van Gogh was complex. It signified Millet, and van Gogh's allegiance to what he had stood for - rural themes in modern art; it signified the seasons and cycles of life and work. But it also referred to the Bible, especially the parable, a particular way of using a commonplace story to convey allegorical meaning.In July 1889 van Gogh painted the complement to his sower, The Reaper, also in violet and yellow tones

12508-3paumg.jpg	The altar has the traditional shape of a winged altarpiece. The outside, the weekday side, displays a workshop production of an Annunciation and the former standing figures of saints Catherine and Barbara. When opened, the magnificent colours of the Nativity are visible, framed by saints George and Eustace.This triptych was commissioned by the brothers Stephan and Lukas Paumgartner for St Catherine's Church in Nuremberg. It may well have been ordered after Stephan's safe return from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1498. The main panel depicts the Nativity, set in an architectural ruin. The left wing shows St George with a fearsome dragon and the right wing St Eustace, with both saints dressed as knights and holding identifying banners. A seventeenth-century manuscript records that the side panels were painted in 1498 and that the two saints were given the features of the Paumgartner brothers (with Stephan on the left and Lukas on the right). This is the earliest occasion on which an artist is known to have used the facial features of a donor in depicting a saint. The exteriors of the wing panels were of the Annunciation, although only the figure of the Virgin on the left panel has survived.On stylistic grounds, the Nativity was painted a few years later than the wings, probably in 1502 or soon afterwards. The tiny body of Christ is almost lost in the composition, surrounded by a swarm of little angels. Peering out from behind the Romanesque columns on the right are the ox and the ass, while opposite them on the left side are the faces of two shepherds. The composition, formed by the ruins of a palatial building, draws the eye towards the archway. Two other shepherds step up into the courtyard, the red and blue of their clothes echoing the colours of Joseph and the Virgin Mary. In the sky, an angel descends to reveal news of Christ's birth to another pair of shepherds tending their flock on the distant hillside. Although traditionally a night-time scene, it is brightly illuminated by a ball of light in the sky.The small figures at the bottom corners of the central panel are the Paumgartner family with their coats of arms. They were painted over in the seventeenth century, when donor portraits went out of favour, and were only uncovered during restoration in 1903. On the left behind Joseph are the male members of the family, Martin Paumgartner, followed by his two sons Lukas and Stephan and an elderly bearded figure who may be Hans Sch�nbach, second husband of Barbara Paumgartner. On the far right is Barbara Paumgartner (n�e Volckamer), with her daughters Maria and Barbara.In 1988 this painting was seriously damaged by a vandal, along with the Lamentation for Christ and the central panel of The Seven Sorrows of the Virgin depicting the grieving Mary. Restoration of the Paumgartner Altarpiece and the Lamentation for Christ was completed in 1998 and work then began on the panel of the Virgin

18419-2007grec.jpg	The Visitation was made for the Oballe Chapel in the Church of San Vicente in Toledo. It was intended to be framed and attached to the ceiling above The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception of the high altar. The intended location explains the dramatic sotto-in-su perspective of the scene, the curved rendering of the floor, and the absence of a horizon line. It does seem that the painting was originally within a circle, and that the canvas has been cut at the left and right.The scene shows the meeting of Mary, on the right, pregnant with Jesus, and her cousin Elizabeth, who was in her sixth month awaiting the child who would become St John the Baptist. The meeting took place at the entrance to the house of Zachariah, the husband of Elizabeth. El Greco shows a classicising doorway with a heavy cornice and consoles on the left.Like other works for the Oballe Chapel, The Visitation is painted with great force and dynamism. The process of de materialisation is complete. There are only shapes, colour and light and the strange quality of the movement - of the 'meeting of two celestial bodies'. Comparison has often been made with The Opening of the Fifth Seal, with reference to the handling of the draperies, the jagged outline of Mary and the flashing white lights everywhere in the painting

32200-05bacch2.jpg	"There are two Bacchanals by Poussin in the Rome museum that are not actually pendants, as they are of different sizes. They are dated to 1626, on the basis of the interest that Poussin had at this time for the Bacchanals of Titian (the painter's enthusiasm is recorded by both Sandrart and Bellori). In both compositions Poussin ""animates"" putti borrowed from antique reliefs and shows them playing with objects also taken from antique friezes. The execution of these two paintings fits perfectly with Poussin's interests and production during his first Roman years in Rome. Along with his colleagues Sandrart, Duquesnoy, Pietro da Cortona, Claude Lorrain and others, Poussin studied and drew from the Bacchanals of Titian at the Palazzo Aldobrandini and the Villa Ludovisi. Poussin actually copied certain details directly from Titian's famous Bacchanal of the Andrians, for example the ""putto mingens"" at the left of the larger picture. Other motifs echo the style of Poussin's fellow Frenchman Duquesnoy, with whom the painter shared Roman living quarters in 1626"

14518-annunci.jpg	The golden period of Salzburg painting in the last years of the 15th century - surpassing Vienna itself in artistic standards - was dominated by the Elder and the Younger Rueland Frueauf. The start of the elder's career went back to Konrad Laib, but his artistic principles prepared the forms of the Renaissance.The action takes place in a simple environment; neither the golden surface of the background nor the puritan stone seat or the Virgin's praying-desk play any considerable role. The spectator's eyes are thus attracted by the figures, the angel floating above in the image field, and the Virgin, listening humbly to the tidings of the divine messenger, her face lit up by a glad smile, bending gently towards her visitor. The two figures fill almost the whole space, hardly any help comes from the folds of the garments, here the bodies themselves have come into their own. The interplay of the creases in the folds, though exceedingly important, fail to hold the spectator's eyes, and the decorative effect which lies dormant in the right-and-left curves of the scroll of inscription is not much exploited either

35397-07desce.jpg	After the termination of the Calvinist regime in Antwerp in 1585, the city's churches were gradually decorated once again with works of art. The process continued and intensified in the early part of the 17th century, when the Southern Netherlands enjoyed a period of stability and prosperity thanks to the peace policies pursued by the Archdukes Albert and Isabella. Art and artists were major beneficiaries. Antwerp was a wealthy city, whose churches were decorated with unusual splendour: Catholic worship had to be especially glorious in this place where the Protestants head recently held sway.In 1611, the Arquebusiers - Antwerp's civic guard - commissioned a Descent from the Cross by their illustrious townsman Rubens for their altar in the cathedral. The dean of the guild at that time was Burgomaster Nicolaas Rockox, who appear in the painting. The Descent from the Cross is the second of Rubens's great altarpieces for the Antwerp Cathedral. It shows the Visitation, and the Presentation of the Temple on either side of the Descent from the Cross. (The first triptych of the Raising of the Cross was executed in 1611-12.) His rich painterly Baroque technique incorporated both elements of Venetian design and also the composition and lighting of the Roman period of Caravaggio. But the result is purely Flemish.Although at first sight the themes presented in the triptych seem extremely wide-ranging, they are actually linked, for St Christopher was the Arquebusiers' patron saint. When the triptych was closed, all that worshippers could see was this scene from the legend of St Christopher, whose Greek name 'Christophorus' means 'Christ-bearer'. This fact forms the key to the entire painting, in which the friends and holy women in the centre panel, and Mary and Simeon in the wings are also 'Christ-bearers'

14605-1medici1.jpg	After purchasing in 1659 the Palazzo Medici from Ferdinando II de' Medici by Gabriello Riccardi, a number of architects contributed to the remodeling of the palace which took thirty years. The most spectacular intervention into the original fabric was the construction, beginning in 1670, an east-west gallery wing. In 1676 the library was built directly beside the gallery. In 1684-89 another new wing was built to the north.Anton Domenico Gabbiani painted three ceilings in the new rooms, the Allegory of the Fine Arts under the Protection of Wisdom and Nature; the Fall of Icarus; and the Triumph over Error. The painted decoration of two additional rooms complete the pictorial program of Gabbiani's ceilings.

38656-curiosit.jpg	Terborch painted a significant number of letter readers and writers. Depictions of this sort enjoyed immense popularity during this period. Since letter writing was primarily (though not exclusively) a leisure activity among the well-to-do it is not surprising that paintings of this theme were so prevalent during the decades in which the Dutch economy expanded greatly.The Curiosity, completed around 1660, features three young women in an ornate interior. One sporting an ermine-trimmed jacket attentively writes a letter as another woman, identifiable as a maid because of her comparatively simple attire, peers inquisitively over her shoulder. To their right stands a young lady of extraordinary beauty and bearing. Her station and propriety are connoted not only by her luxurious garments but also by her long handkerchief.

25105-0ursula.jpg	The two large wings are each composed of four small panels painted on both sides. On the front side the legend of St Ursula and the eleven thousand virgins is related. The order follows as in an open book:1. In the foreground the heathen king of England hands a message to a herald. It contains the request to marry his son Etherius (with falcon) to the pious Ursula, daughter of Deonotus, king of Brittany. The herald's tunic bears the coat-of-arms of Edward IX (king of England at the time the painting was made). In the middle ground he leaves for Brittany. In the background he hands the message to King Deonotus, in Ursula's presence.2. With divine inspiration Ursula accepts, on condition that she may first be sent eleven thousand virgins with whom she would make a pilgrimage to Rome. The scene shows the embarkation of the virgins, under the watchful eye of the king and queen of England and the prince.3. Ursula also embarks and bids farewell to her parents on the rocky shore. The ship carries coats-of-arms with the blazon of the dukes of Brittany. In the background the belfry of Bruges can be seen, though without its octagonal crown, which was built from 1482 to 1486.4. The pilgrims disembark in Cologne, whose city arms can be seen over the city gate. An angel predicts to Ursula that on her return from Rome she will die a martyr's death here in Cologne.5. The journey reaches Basel, after which it continues on foot to Rome, which is portrayed in the foreground. At the back the pope and his retinue advance towards the pilgrims. On the coat-of-arms: S[enatus] P[opulus] Q[ue] R[omanus].6. On leaving Rome Ursula is accompanied by the pope, Cardinal Vincentius and James, archbishop of Antioch, who wished to join her on the return journey.7. In Cologne the whole party is murdered by the Huns who had meanwhile occupied the city under their leader Julius (in a long tunic on the quayside). In the ship above left we can make out Prince Etherius, who had obeyed a heavenly voice and come to Cologne to die as a martyr with Ursula.8. In a chapel the faithful venerate the relics of St Ursula and the eleven thousand virgins. They belong to different social classes: there are aristocrats and burghers. On the left kneels a pilgrim with insignia and a box of provisions. A priest prays at the altar. Candles and wax ex-votos are sold at the entrance. Above left a nun in a black habit kneels unobtrusively. Without being intended as a portrait, she may represent an augustine nun.The two small wings, which probably belonged to the same altarpiece, show the Church or the New Testament and the Synagogue or the Old Testament. The Church holds the chalice and the cross-shaped staff. The Synagogue is blindfolded and holds in her right hand a broken lance while the old tables of the law are slipping from her left hand.For the history of Ursula the thirteenth-century Legenda Aurea has been followed fairly faithfully.The original form of the altarpiece can only be guessed at. The central panel may have resembled the altarpiece portrayed on the eighth panel, although it should not be identified with it. It is, however, likely that it too showed the figure of Ursula protecting the eleven thousand virgins under her cape, either in painted or sculpted form. Judging by their common provenance and style the small panels with Church and Synagogue apparently also belonged to this retable. They were probably the upper wings of the panels with the Ursula legend which, when closed, were intended to cover a central panel with a raised centrepiece. The painter is unknown. The panels were attributed to Dieric Bouts in the nineteenth century but later to a contemporary of Memling, designated the Master of the Legend of St Ursula. Since the belfry is shown without its octagonal superstructure, built from 1482 to 1486, the altarpiece definitely predates Memling's Ursula Shrine (completed 1489), it was painted before 1482

05089-venlover.jpg	One of Bordone's most celebrated works, this painting represents a favourite subject of early sixteenth-century Venetian art. Its Giorgionesque reminiscences, here reduced to a sort of bourgeois languor, date it around 1525-30. Yet it also shows a Mannerist restlessness that relates it to contemporary work by Palma il Vecchio. The scene is one of venal love (note the pallor of the man embracing the woman). Although the mysterious third figure with the swaggering air may portray a procurer, his artist's beret suggests that it may be a self-portrait. In that case the meaning of the work would be allegorical rather than specific

15894-gerolami.jpg	The new church type, developed in the Baroque period, offered large format vertical picture surfaces on the inner fa�ade and on the dividing wall between the nave and the choir, which were used both for oil paintings and for frescoes. It was not as easy to see the pictures on the inner fa�ade because of the light from the windows, yet it was costumary to incorporate these surfaces into the iconographic program. The most magnificent solutions for this space were found in Naples. Luca Giordano came up with the most ingenious way of reinterpreting this surface through painting. His multifigured and highly animated Expulsion of the Moneychangers from the Temple on the entrance wall of the Chiesa degli Gerolamini, a composition perfectly adapted to the architectural situation with its large centre doorway, would become one of his most celebrated works.The scene can be understood as a reminder to viewers, in the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, that respectful behaviour was expected in sacred spaces, which explains why such scenes are so common on entrance walls in the Baroque period

32303-01healin.jpg	The painting, which was executed for a silk and brocade manufacturer from Lyons, formed the subject of a lecture at the Academic Royale in Paris in 1668, when the painter Sebastien Bourdon argued that Poussin had here treated the essential aspects of painting &#151; light, composition, proportion, colour and harmony &#151; in an exemplary manner and had fused them into a perfect whole, and concluded that Poussin's art should be considered the supreme example for all artists			
18255-0703grec.jpg	In formal portraiture of the period, it is characteristic that the individuality of the sitter is subservient to the manifestation of virtue. El Greco's portrait of an unknown knight with his hand on his breast is an example. He is shown solemnly committing his whole being to a higher principle, for the gesture of placing the right hand on the heart signalled not only pious respect but also a declaration of intent that would be upheld as a matter of honour. Since the knight directly faces and presents himself to the viewer, exactly as if he were making a vow, the viewer becomes a witness to his solemn act.Formerly the painting was supposed to be a portrait of Juan da Silva, Marques de Montmayor, 'Notario Mayor' of Toledo.

21139-sodring.jpg	A plant is a significant presence in the portrait that the leading Danish painter of the age, Christen K&#248;bke, painted of his friend Frederik S&#248;dring (1809-62) on his birthday in 1832. The smiling, ruddy cheeked landscape painter is seated palette in hand. The vigorous ivy in a pot behind him has a multiple purpose, standing for the friendship that binds artist and sitter, and the creativity that enables him to mediate between nature and the ideal - represented respectively by the pictures of a cow and of Roman ruins pinned to the wall. Once again, while adopting the organic image of creativity common to Romanticism, K&#248;bke's picture presents a wholesome, outgoing impression of the artist's life

44078-03stivo1.jpg	This picture, with its portrait-like close-up view of a man reading, is unique in early Netherlandish painting. However, it is not really a portrait. A 16th-century inscription, now removed, described the man as St Ivo. As a lawyer, he was particularly active on behalf of the poor, but since the figure does not have the saint's specific attributes, this identification is not certain. The painting is very much in Rogier van der Weyden's style, but shows weaknesses in the drawing of the hands and the foreshortening of the face, and is therefore probably from his workshop

24039-1sposi2.jpg	The fresco decorates the north wall of the Camera degli Sposi in the north tower of the Castel San Giorgio in Mantua.The north wall of the Camera degli Sposi contains a remarkable assemblage of all the members of the Gonzaga family and court, including various officials, a dwarf, and the pet dog. The duke, Ludovico, is seated near the extreme left, with his wife, Barbara, occupying a prominent position beside him. This group portrait also contains an element of narrative, because it depicts the delivery of an important letter. In this manner Mantegna avoids a static and posed series of likenesses.Lifted from the overall narrative context and considered as a family group portrait, the Court must rank among the finest examples of that genre, rivaling those by Velazquez and Goya. Unfortunately, the fresco has suffered from humidity, injury, and poor restoration so that the polished refinement of the original can only be partially appreciated today

06079-gallantc.jpg	At the beginning of the 1660s, van Brekelenkam turned to representations of courtship and related themes and consequently introduced a hitherto unseen level of elegance and finesse into his work. The Sentimental Conversation of around 1663 shows elaborate furnishings as is fitting for its subject: polite conversation between a smartly dressed couple. The interactions of the figures in this picture (and related ones by the master) owe much to the art of Terborch, the foremost contemporary Dutch painter of courtship themes. The presence of a musical instrument and wine, time-honored motifs of love, suggest that the young pair converse about amorous matters. And consider as well the presence of a large, rocky landscape on the wall behind them. This landscape, with its traveler ascending a steep and arduous path, possibly comments upon the nature of the couple's relationship and loves travail in general

34648-avenue.jpg	"This small, finely executed painting is a good example of Hubert Robert's refined art. Robert, a French painter of the second half of the 18th century, is known mainly for his landscapes decorated with imaginary architecture and little figures, in which happiness, reality and fiction, archaeological taste and sense of decoration are all mingled. Avenue in a Park is a late work in the painter's career, testifying to the permanence of his style and to his taste for a nature that has been disciplined and made decorative by man.The subject matter still reflects the ""douceur de vivre"" so dear to the 18th century. An avenue lined with trees with their tops intertwined leads the spectator towards the bottom of the garden. In the centre, a young girl is playing on a swing, activated by two companions. A group of people to the right are looking on. The whole painting bathes in a soft harmony of browns, greys and greens against a bluish sky background. The red coat of the man leaning against the pedestal catches the viewer's eye. The antique statues - reposing satyr and faun playing a flute - flanking the tree-lined opening in the foreground had been earlier captured by Robert in a red chalk drawing of various Graeco-Roman sculptures conserved in the Capitol (Valence, Mus�e des Beaux Arts). The artist has repeated them here the other way round. The young musician in turn had appeared in several of Robert's paintings.Arriving in Rome in 1754, Robert stayed there for over 10 years. It is there that he met the Abb� de Saint-Non, Giovanni Battista Piranesi and in particular Gian Paolo Panini, who was to have a lasting influence on him. He also became friends with Fragonard. The little painting in Brussels confirms the close links between the art of ""Robert of the Ruins"" and Fragonard's poetic universe. The avenue of trees also refers to the many parks and gardens in Italy and the Ile-de-France which were to nourish his imagination throughout his long and successful career. Robert exhibited at every salon from 1767 to 1798, becoming ""designer of the King's gardens"" in 1777 and much later, after the revolutionary tumult, producing plans for converting the Grande Galerie of the Louvre into a museum."

01126-portrait.jpg	In the last centuries this painting was attributed to different painters based on the initials to be found in the lower part of the picture. Since these initials were resolved as A. F(errariensis) P(ixit), the painting was mentioned for a long time as the work of A.F. Master from Ferrara. Later it was attributed to Baldassare Estense, the natural son of Niccol&#242; III d'Este. Finally, the attribution to the Bolognese painter Antonio Leonelli da Crevalcore (Crevalcore is north of Bologna) seems to be final. The painting shows a carefully coifed, tight-lipped sitter in sharp profile behind an elaborate window casement of luxurious marbles. Matrimonial objects, a pearl and a gold ring set with a ruby are displayed on a breviary that projects into the viewer's space.The identity of the young man on the picture is not established. Constanzo Sforza, Antonio Ordelaffi or somebody from the Fugger family are usually mentioned as possible identification.This portrait is the artist's earliest surviving work and the one that most reveals his indebtedness to the example of Francesco del Cossa

19242-stillif1.jpg	The pair of paintings, the Still-Life with Flowers and a Dog, and the Still-Life with a Puppy formed part of the interior decoration of Jean de Croy's palace in Madrid. This Flemish nobleman, Count of Soire and Captain of the Flemish Guard of Archers, was also the owner of Van der Hamen's Offering to Flora. The paintings, which were probably commissioned by De Croy (d. 1638), hung unframed on either side of the doorway of a room that led on to the picture gallery. Here, they probably served as illusionistic extensions of real space, perhaps by reproducing the actual floor of the room. The dog and its playful puppy may well have portrayed actual animals owned by the patron. The theme of the pictures is related to the culture of aristocratic hospitality, that was such a necessary part of the refined lifestyle of the occupants of the house. In one of the pictures, a wine cooler stands on the floor and the side tables covered with green velvet damask display sweetmeats and a glass ewer with aloja, an aromatic drink popular at the time, while the clock shows that it is just before five o'clock, an appropriate time for such treats.The major motifs in these pictures are two large gilt ormolu and glass vases with floral arrangements. These vessels represent a type of luxury decorative object that suited the status of Van der Hamen s patron, and the flowers they contain stand out for the copiousness and variety of their blooms. They doubtlessly evoke real arrangements of flowers that formed a part of the rich decor of Soire's house. However, these were not painted from life and are artificial images in representing blooms in such perfect condition and in bringing together flowers that bloom at different times of the year.

Upon his arrival, however, the city gate closes itself up before him, and an angel indicates that the Emperor must enter the city not on horseback but rather - in remembrance of Christ - in a humble manner, whereupon Heraclius carries the Cross into the city on foot wearing only his shirt.There is no difference in the size of the figures, thus no spatial perspective.The majority of the figures are illustrated in profile. Traditionally it is believed that the man standing beside the executioner is the painter himself

40016-3bed2.jpg	Towards the end of 1892 Lautrec was commissioned to produce decorations for the salon walls of the Rue d'Amboise brothel, and he decided to design 16 panels in the style of Louis XV, each one centring on an oval portraits of one of the girls. It was during this time that Lautrec had the opportunity to study their lifestyle at close quarters.He was fascinated to discover that many of them were deeply in love with each other, and he frequently made these couples the subjects of his paintings. He thereby succeeded in portraying the genuine depth of these lesbian relationships without exposing the girls' tenderness and helplessness to voyeurism

13331-28margar.jpg	The small, intimate picture is the portrait of Margaret van Eyck, the painter's wife. The portrait is transparently shadowed and its white hood subtly modelled. Until the French Revolution, the painters' corporation kept this work in its chambers, treating it almost like a holy relic. How it came to be there remains unknown, especially since its creator, a court painter, had never been a guildsman. Completed in 1439, just two years before his death, Van Eyck may have intended the work for his home. Perhaps he gave it to his wife as a birthday present, as the panel incorporates the mock-chiselled 'speaking' inscription - my husband Johannes finished painting me in the year 1439 on 15 June / my age was thirty-three. This is followed by the artist's own motto in Greek characters, als ikh kan (to the best of my ability), probably an anagram of his name based on the traditional closing formula used by manuscript copyists. Van Eyck was, after all, a copier of reality

06896-madonna.jpg	The form of this painting is almost harsh, as if hammered out rather than modeled, and the contours are as incisive as if they had been scratched into the surface. In part, colour dominates the form and has a perspective function, giving the planes their  distance in depth. The overall effect is that of a painted bas-relief, in which the colour is subtle rather than bold. Accordingly, the work reflects the two major influences on Boutonniere: Mantegna and Foppa. At the same time, Butinone reveals his taste for virtuoso detail in the Child's pleated shirt, the hair filleted with red-gold and the mannered gesture of the Madonna's hands as they leaf through the book

12517-1jabach1.jpg	The panel is a wing of the Jabach Altarpiece, named after one of its previous owners. Originally, however, it was commissioned by Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony. Another panel in Cologne, depicting two musicians, belongs to this altar, too. It is conceivable that these two pictures are the results of sawing a larger one in two. Even though their conditions differ, it is clearly visible that the background and the horizon in both pictures match, and portions of the clothes of Job's wife may be found in the picture of the two musicians. There is even a sixteenth-century drawing which shows the two paintings as one composition. The two pictures together may have constituted the centre panel of a Job altar commissioned by Frederick the Wise to commemorate the plague which ravaged the German lands in 1503.It should be noted that there are scholars who have proposed that these two pictures used to form the two wing-panels of a triptych showing the Adoration of the Magi (now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence).The altar, besides depicting Job as the patron saint of people suffering skin diseases, also points to his connection with music. On the first part of the painting we see the suffering Job cowering on a refuse heap while his wife drenches him with water. On the second part, the musicians are certainly the representatives of healing music. According to the medieval melotherapy, Job, who was devoted to music when he was healthy, should recover upon hearing the melody

22471-01virgin.jpg	Filippino was the son of the artist Fra Filippo Lippi. His father, however, died when the boy was only twelve, about the age when he would have begun his artistic training. Filippino's education was taken over by his father's pupil, Botticelli, and their association lasted many years.This painting is probably a very early work by Filippino  - some, in fact, believe it to be his earliest one to survive. At this point in his career, Filippino was still strongly under Botticelli's influence. The lyrical and graceful line - the rippling cascades of drapery and the fanlike fall of cloth at the Virgin's hem - show Filippino's debt to his teacher, but the confident colours are the artist's own. As his style matured, Filippino moved away from the linearity of Botticelli. The diaphanous shimmer of fabric and sad delicacy of his faces give his works an elusive and poetic quality.The half-round shape of this painting, called a lunette, was used most often over doorways. Probably this one was placed over the entrance to a private chapel or sacristy, but its original location remains unknown

14154-08didero.jpg	"At the time this portrait was painted, Denis Diderot was one of the most famous literati in Paris. As the editor and publisher of the Encyclop�die, and author of many articles, novels and pieces of art criticism, he had great reputation. His competence as a critic was founded on immense reading. From aristocratic Rococo culture to the bourgeois ethic of virtue, his books and articles accompanied the whole of French art production under the ancien regime.Fragonard's portrait of Diderot is part of his series of 'figures des fantaisies,' which was being built up at this time and depicts people in particularly inspired moments. Diderot himself had, on the occasion of another portrait, demanded the ""grace of action"". He wanted an action appropriate to the activity of the sitter, one which characterized him. The supreme commandment here was truth and naturalness of presentation. The action and pose were to be demonstrated with natural gestures. The ideal, for Diderot, was solitude in an unobserved moment, and the portrait was to simulate this. And as an unobserved genius in a state of inspired thought-production is also how Fragonard depicts him. This is a familiar enough genre, but Fragonard stages the enthusiasm of literary ideas with his impulsive painting technique and this combines the interest of the sitter with that of the beholder, a central concept in Diderot's theory of art"

17723-210goya.jpg	Painted at the same time as La Ca�da, La Cucana is described in Goya's account: 'a maypole, as in a village square, with boys climbing up it to win a prize of chickens and roscas [ring-shaped biscuits] that are hanging on top, and several people watching, with a background to correspond'. The small scale of the figures in relation to the background is a feature of all the paintings of this series.

Although begun in Rome, the painting was actually completed a little later in Paris.Potocki came from one of the most celebrated Polish families, and had recently become very wealthy thanks to his wife's dowry. He was also a scholar, and translated and commented on the work of Winckelmann. Obviously his portrait had to be impressive and suggestive of his status.

31393-paolina2.jpg	"The seemingly plastic organization of the walls features bronze chiaroscuri framed in stone; round-headed niches flanked by columns, with ""living"" figures of the Virtues; overdoor paintings with female personifications; and pairs of putti holding bronze tondi. The plastic organization of the walls enters into competition with the fully plastic, partially gilded stucco of the ceiling and its colourful paintings.The six ceiling paintings and the large wall areas were reserved for scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, while the act of Apostle Paul - from his conversion to martyrdom - were depicted in the six tondi above the doors of the room. The selection of these two protagonists was clearly intended to play on the two names of the pope (Alessandro Farnese having become Paul III).Perino del Vaga painted just a part of the frescoes, the other parts being done by collaborators following his cartoons. Marco Pino from Siena, a student of Beccafumi, painted the six Alexander scenes on the vault:1. Alexander the Great before the High Priest2. Alexander the Great in the Temple of Jerusalem3.

14456-302fried.jpg	This large-format painting was probably purchased by the future Alexander II of Russia, whose collection also included Moonrise by the Sea (also in the Hermitage). Its vast panorama has often been interpreted as a vision of the hereafter, although the pastoral staffage in the foreground lends the whole the quality of an idyll and the rocky terrain can in fact be accessed via the path that runs at least as far as the steep cliffs in the middle ground. Opening up in front of the tiny shepherds on the rocky pinnacle, so we assume, is a view down into the dizzying depths below and beyond the track and cliffs into the infinite distance - a view yielding an impression of the sublime.

21265-2youngma.jpg	A book of engravings of Kupecky's paintings published in Nuremberg in 1745, contains an engraved copy of this picture, made by Bernhard Vogel in 1736. This mezzotint engraving identifies the represented person as: R. Donauer, Pict. Moscov. Thus the painting depicts the painter Gottfried Donauer or Danhauer who, according to the contemporary writer von Hagedorn, was of Swabian origin and a clockmaker like his father. Kupecky, who according to his biographer F�ssli, while returning from Rome, became acquainted in Venice with the portrait painter Sebastiano Bombelli, may have met Donauer in Venice. Thus the picture probably was made at the beginning of Kupecky's career, in Italy and then taken by him to Vienna and to Nuremberg. However, some copies of Vogel's engraving call the picture The Allegory of Hearing. Hence it is possible, that the painting, which for a time was attributed also to �d�m M�nyoki, belonged to a series representing The Five Senses. As we do not know any authentic portrait of Donauer, and Kupecky's authentic Italian works have hardly survived, the identification and dating must remain open to question

The action in them was carried out by a limited number of figures placed in the foreground and clearly highlighted, giving these paintings an almost relief-like appearance; it may well have been his intention to suggest a comparison with antique relief sculpture.The Jupiter and Callisto is one of the many secular subjects Rubens painted in this relief style. The subject of the painting is taken from Ovid. Diana's nymphs were expected to be as chaste as the goddess herself. One of them, Callisto, was seduced by Jupiter who first disguised himself as Diana in order to gain the nymphs presence. Her pregnancy was eventually noticed by Diana who punished Callisto by changing her into a a bear and setting the dogs on her. But Jupiter snatched her up to heaven just in time.

18703-3caesar.jpg	Girolamo Godi, organizer of a Vicenzan literary salon and friend of Pietro Bembo and Alvise Cornaro, engaged Gualtiero around 1550 to decorate the villa. In addition to the loggia, the decoration of four rooms in the right wing of the villa can be ascribed to Gualtiero: the Hall of the Gods or the Putto, the Hall of the Triumphs, the Hall of the Caesars, and the Hall of the Sacrifices. Gualtiero's sudden death in 1552 prevented him from completing the work which was taken over by Battista Zelotti and Battista del Moro, who created the frescoes in the other rooms.The Hall of the Caesars owes its name to the busts of Roman emperors, painted to imitate bronzes, located above the doors inside faux frames that are richly decorated  and inhabited by playful putti. Landscapes, framed by large, arched faux windows, punctuate the long walls. The landscapes are clearly influenced by Flemish painting

24483-st_agnes.jpg	In Valencia, the Italian Renaissance was established on firmer foundations than elsewhere in Spain. Valencian painting from about 1520 to the end of the century revolves around the dynasty created by Vicente Masip whose style was formed in the period just before Fernando Llanos and Fernando Yanez arrived in Valencia, bringing Italian Renaissance influences to Valencian painting. Masip subsequently assimilated the style of these more advanced artists. In his art, Masip embodied four distinct stages of Italian painting, beginning with the Emilia-Paduan style of the later Quattrocento and passing through Leonardo and early Sebastiano del Piombo to Raphael. Although he lived until 1550, his interest in Italian art seems to have ended with Raphael; there are no traces of Mannerism in his work.The Martyrdom of St Agnes, executed for the Convent Church of San Juli�n, Valencia, incorporates motifs from Raphael's Stanza d'Eliodoro and the tapestries of the Acts of the Apostles, woven for the Sistine Chapel

17816-720goya.jpg	The tilt of the head and concentrated expression of the eyes suggest that the artist has portrayed himself looking in a mirror or at the easel on which he is painting. Of the numerous self-portraits that Goya made during the course of his life, this painting, made when he was 69 years old, is perhaps the most intimate, with the exception of the likeness on his sick bed, frail and suffering, made five years later. A Self-Portrait in the Prado, signed and bearing the same date (discovered during recent cleaning), is similar in style and general appearance but there are slight variations in the pose and costume and in the expression of the face, which seems to reflect a more melancholy mood.The portrait remained in Goya's possession until his death, when it passed to his son. He presented it to the Academy in 1829 when the debt for the equestrian portrait of Ferdinand VII, commissioned by the Academy and painted by Goya in 1808, was finally liquidated. Because of the unusual position of the head it was once suggested that this was a sketch for the Self-Portrait with Dr Arrieta but the direction of the head is different and this is the face of a 69-year-old, looking weary perhaps but with no sign of the ravages of illness that were to transform it

11703-7madonna.jpg	The Madonna and Child in Washington and the Saints John the Baptist and Francis in the Santa Croce Museum in Florence both belong to Domenico's late period and are closely related stylistically to the Magnoli Altarpiece.The Washington Madonna is the same elegant and gentle figure typical of all Veneziano's female characters. The background is taken up by a flowering hedge, a motif that by this time had become quite common in mid-Quattrocento Florentine painting.The dating of this painting is a matter of controversy: some scholars think that it must have been painted just before the Magnoli Altarpiece, while others consider it an early work. But the most convincing theory dates it at after 1447: the argument is that certain elements present in this Madonna, such as the pale colours and the strongly sculptural modelling of the figures, are typical of Domenico's late works

24441-shadow.jpg	"In the Acts of the Apostles (5: 12-14) this episode is recounted immediately after the story of Ananias, illustrated in the fresco to the right.Scholars have never doubted that this scene is entirely by Masaccio. Starting with Vasari (1568), who used the man with the hood as the portrait of Masolino he put on the frontispiece of his biography of the artist, all later scholars have tried to identify the contemporary characters portrayed in the scene. It was noticed that the bearded man holding his hands together in prayer is the same person as one of the Magi in the predella of the Pisa Polyptych, now in Berlin; furthermoree it has been suggested that it may be a portrait of Donatello, while others think that Donatello is the old man with a beard between St Peter and St John. According to another view this character is Giovanni, nicknamed Lo Scheggia, Masaccio's brother; while some believe that he is a self-portrait.The removal of the altar has uncovered a section of the painting, at the far right, which is of fundamental importance in understanding the episode: this section includes the facade of a church, a bell tower, a stretch of blue sky and a column with a Corinthian capital behind St John. Also extremely important is the way Masaccio conceived the right-hand margin of the composition. To give the space a more regular geometrical construction, Masaccio has created ""a complex play of optical effects and of perspective, as we can see in the lower section of the window jamb, where he has solved graphically an architectural problem, pictorially adjusting the faulty plumb-line of the edge of the jamb and the end wall; he makes the story, and therefore some of the background constructions, continue on the jamb.""The street, depicted in accurate perspective, is lined with typically mediaeval Florentine houses; in fact, the scene appears to be set near San Felice in Piazza, which had a commemorative column standing in front of it. But the splendid palace in rusticated stone looks like Palazzo Vecchio in the lower section (the high socle that we can still see on the facade along Via della Ninna, with the small built-in door), although it is much more similar to Palazzo Pitti in the upper part (the windows with their rusticated stone frames). And in some details, such as the exact geometrical scansion of the ashlars, it is an anticipation of later facades, first and foremost Palazzo Antinori"

24896-stigmatb.jpg	This is a portable Franciscan diptych which critics variously associated with the Luccan school of the Berlinghieri. In actual fact the work seems to characterize admirably a period of Florentine art represented by the master mosaicists of the cupola of the Baptistery and Coppo di Marcovaldo.Characteristic of this master, who may reasonably be considered pre-Giottesque, was a direct and vehement insistence on the significance of the scene. Note, for example, the naturalness of the surroundings, with the hill and the temple rising above and almost holding up the kneeling saint as if to emphasize his bodily weight. This concreteness, a quality at the heart of Florentine painting from these very early times, might explain why Vasari attributed the work to Cimabue.

19762-water_mi.jpg	"No one landscape painter of the Northern Low Countries has repeated the motif of water mills as often as Meindert Hobbema. More than 30 paintings treating this theme are known and are considered to represent some of his finest work. This theme, which was finally to become a sort of trade mark of Hobbema's work, was not, however, his own discovery, but that of his teacher Jacob van Ruisdael. Of the latter it is known with certainty that in the 1650s he travelled through the eastern provinces of Gelderland and Overijssel. There he made four drawings of the overhead water mills with the water brought along an elevated wooden gulley that are typical for the region, as also depicted here by Hobbema. Two similar drawings by Hobbema are preserved, but it remains unclear whether these were made in situ or based on Ruisdael's observations. With the exception of one painting, the world-famous  Alley at Middelharnis, the origin of which remains swathed in mystery, Hobbema produced all his masterpieces within a very short period between 1663 and 1668.The present unsigned and undated panel fits into this series. Following his appointment to the well-paid function of wine-gauger of the city of Amsterdam, Hobbema in 1668 largely or totally gave up his painter's career: no dated work is known after 1669. Hobbema is frequently portrayed as the highly gifted but more superficial and less imaginative successor to Ruisdael and who, in his Amsterdam studio, specialised in wooded landscapes built up around a pond or a winding pathway. Invariably vistas between the tree allow us to see through to sun-drenched areas. Hobbema developed carefully balanced views of rural sites of the kind that became very popular with 19th century English and French romantic artists and in this way escaped oblivion. The definition ""picturesque landscape"" appears very appropriate for views like those of Hobbema"

31995-3tondo2.jpg	Four tondos with the Evangelists still adorn the pendentives that once supported the old cupola of the Cappella Capponi in the church of Santa Felicit&#224; in Florence. Except for the painting of St John, the precise authorship of the other three portraits has posed considerable problems for scholars. As Vasari only attributes two of the tondi to Bronzino, without specifying which, scholars are still divided over which and how many of them were painted by Bronzino, the apprentice to Pontormo. Probably Bronzino was responsible for the St Matthew with an intense gaze, half-closed mouth, and tousled red hair, painted with thickly laid-on and glowing brushstrokes and enlivened by the strong light that falls on the figure with a swirling crimson cloak, set against the dark background. Probably also Bronzino's is the St Mark with its palette of yellow and red tones contrasting with the green of the mantle wrapped around the figure, which looks as if it is peering through a window, an idea drawn from the Gospel.The bald St John with a long beard seems to share the same uneasy and sorrowful humanity lavished on the body of Christ in the Deposition by Pontormo in the same chapel, this tondo can certainly be attributed to Pontormo. St Luke is probably also a contribution by Pontormo.The figures of the Evangelists, with their distinctly Michelangiolesque flavour, have a vigour deriving from the way their heads are twisted and pushed forward. They are wrapped in ample robes, whose bold colours stand out against the dark backgrounds. This play of strong contrasts, which exalts the delicate outlines of the coloured surfaces, is in keeping with the refined style of the entire decoration of the chapel

31206-03jerome.jpg	"In 1451 Piero was in Rimini. Before that he painted two small panels, St Jerome and a Donor (in Venice) and Penance in St Jerome (in the Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Berlin). We do not know exactly for whom these were painted, but they are probably to be included amongst the ""many of small figures"" mentioned by Vasari as being commissioned by several rulers during the artist's journeys in the Marches and Emilia-Romagna.In this small panel we can see for the first time Piero's signature, on the tree trunk that forms the base of the Crucifix in the left-hand corner. On the ground, in the foreground, there is also an inscription indicating that the panel was commissioned by Gerolamo Amadi ""veneziano"" who is shown kneeling in prayer before the saint. The donor and his protecting saint appear to be conversing as equals, for it was obviously Piero's intention to exalt the human dignity of his patron, as he was to do again in the case of Sigismondo Malatesta in Rimini. The bright hues of colour are similar to the clear sunlit atmosphere of the London Baptism of Christ, and even the background, with its rolling hills and steep country paths, confirms a vision of landscape that was first anticipated in the London painting.Compared to Paolo Uccelo's nighttime, rather abstract and fairytale landscapes, or Fra Angelico's gentle and precious ones, Piero's are closer to Veneziano's, or even Masaccio's, with bare hills, partially covered with vegetation. And Piero makes his landscapes even more real and alive, for the vegetation is burnt out by a Mediterranean sun, the city walls are made of white lime and the water of the river is transparent"

00884-40north.jpg	Below the lunette two scenes are represented: St Sixtus Entrusts the Church Treasures to Lawrence; St Lawrence Distributing Alms.St Lawrence, a third-century Roman who, like St Stephen, suffered a violent death for his faith, was venerated as one of the most famous martyrs of the city of Rome. This fresco panel is divided in two, without any attempt to give the neighbouring scenes any architectural or spatial cohesion. The architecture employed by Angelico in both scenes is of a distinctly Roman splendour and dignity. The two events from the life of the saint are simply told. They are rich in detail but none is superfluous to the narrative.On the left he kneels to receive the treasures of the Church from Pope St Sixtus II, who is given the features of Angelico's patron, Nicholas V. It has been suggested that the depiction of the two soldiers preparing to break open a bricked-up door, is a reference to Pope Nicholas's decision to declare 1450 a Jubilee Year.On the right, St Lawrence is shown framed in the entrance to a colonnaded basilica of great monumentality. The distant apse further frames and gives emphasis to the saint. He is attended by the poor, blind and lame, and hands money to a legless man in the immediate foreground. His scarlet vestment is scattered with golden flames and hints at his future death by burning

07773-50dream.jpg	"Canvas No. 5 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".Carpaccio's masterful ability at grasping each detail while still preserving the unity of the scene and its symbolic value reaches its peak in this cycle in the painting of the Dream. In the preparatory drawings, now in the Drawings Collection in the Uffizi in Florence, there is an intensely lyrical feeling of space, which in the painting becomes even more magical and enchanted. The elements of reality are arranged in perfect perspective constructions, creating scenes that will remain part of our memory for the rest of time: he is capable of describing a late Quattrocento Venetian bedroom with an objectivity that reminds one of Vermeer.Below a canopy supported by tall thin rods, the sleeping Ursula is visited in her dreams by the angel (notice the sharp shadow he casts on the ground) who tells her of her imminent martyrdom. The light shines brightly behind the angel and penetrates into the room from the roundels below the beams, from the windows and from the half-open door leading into the next room; but it does not succeed in dispelling all the shadows in the bedroom.In this chiaroscuro atmosphere, every detail is rendered with subdued light and soft shadows: the little slippers, the gold crown and the little dog at the foot of the bed; the little table with the hourglass on it and the book, still open at the page where Ursula stopped reading; the pots on the window ledge with carnations and myrtle growing in them, plants that symbolize earthly and heavenly love; the holy image lit by the smoking candle that we can see through the elaborately carved frame and the equally richly carved chair below it; the antique gilded bronze statuettes of Hercules and Venus above the door-frames; the cupboard with its doors ajar so that we can see its contents"

03916-208bacch.jpg	"The Young Bacchus is a small panel work transferred onto canvas, formerly assigned to Basaiti, though now accepted as one of Bellini's last works; also accepted is its identification with the Young Bacchus Holding a Vase attributed to Giorgione, which Ridolfi saw in the property of Bartolo Dolfini in Venice in the middle of the 17th century. A metaphorical rapport is suggested between the representation of the child god and the alternation of the seasons, in the same way in which it is drawn in Macrobio's Saturnalia, which was printed with commentaries in the humanistic age. The idea of the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, would correspond with the smallness of Bacchus.Certainly the small Bacchus must be seen as very close to the Feast of the Gods, the masterpiece of Bellini's last years. Indeed, the resemblance between the Bacchus of the Feast and the Young Bacchus has been pointed out several times. In the small canvas, however, we witness yet again the incredible openness that the almost ninety year-old artist succeeded in advancing in his affirmation of a new profane sensibility, the same that ran through the Naked Woman 'in front af the Mirror of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and the Drunkenness of Noah of the Mus�e des Beaux Arts in Besan�on. The same landscape background against which the young Bacchus is seated was by now an image that was so essentialized and reduced to pure ideal substance that it seems referable only to the other foreshortening, similarly idealized and eternal, of the Viennese Naked Woman. Also in addressing himself to and portraying nature Bellini had covered a considerable distance. One might say, indeed, that he no longer needed to look at it or represent it with elements that were in some way real or recognizable; nor did he need to animate it in any way. He gave only its pure structure, the inner and ""philosophical"" vision"

40996-06wilton.jpg	This is the left panel of the Wilton Diptych (named after the house in which it was preserved), the finest work in England in the International Gothic style. Although it is a painting of extraordinary beauty and must be from the hand of an artist of the highest rank, critics disagree as to whether  he was English, French or Italian.St Edmund, king and martyr, St Edward the Confessor and St John the Baptist present the kneeling monarch Richard II of England in the left panel to the azure assembly of the Virgin and Child, attended by angels, on the right panel. The left scene is set in an earthly forest, the right in the flowering garden of heaven.The artist, who was probably one of the king's painters, has lavished more care on the delineation of the personal emblems and insignia of the king than on his actual personality. There was no need for the latter, since this donor image was meant for the eyes of the donor himself. The monarch wears around his neck the white hart badge which Richard adopted in 1390 as his personal insignia. It reappears on the reverse of the left panel. Both it and the French insignia of broom-cods (seed-pods) are woven into the king's iridescent gold mantle. The white hart badge is also worn by each of the eleven angels, who thus become royal retainers. One of them holds the banner of St George. The event commemorated here has been conjectured as Richard's coronation in 1377, his seeking divine sanction for a crusade in the mid-1990s, or his meeting with the French king in 1396.But need it refer to a specific historical moment? Surely it is an outstanding example of a private image, a portable diptych that would follow the king on his travels. Every time he knelt before it he would be transported among the timeless company of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the angels

Its fettering symbolises the soul caged in the body. Only with the Resurrection is the soul set free. Thus, the bird also becomes a symbol of resurrection.

23599-perseus.jpg	After studying in Vicenza under Maganza, a late Mannerist painter of limited importance, Francesco Maffei turned to the paintings of Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese and Jacopo Bassano and soon achieved a personal style based on a Baroque reworking of the lessons taught by the great artists of the sixteenth century. Maffei moved to Venice in 1638, was attracted by the painters Liss, Fetti and Strozzi and developed his own version of their free and fanciful modern painting with a gifted, exuberant dreamlike quality. Amongst the most significant examples of this period is the painting of Perseus cutting the head off the Medusa.The figures, painted with impetuous, disdainful passion, crowd on the surface of the picture and are completely lacking in perspective relationship and in precise setting in their surroundings. The bright tones seem to swell as if as the result of some internal pressure, offering themselves as incandescent magma to the light which breaks them up into iridescent chromatic ornamental units. The sensual brightness of the colours underlines the emphatic strain on the links between the figures, lending the whole an emotional theatricality which was amongst the most visionary and unbiased of the Baroque age in Venice

15736-poseidon.jpg	"Felice Giani had studied Raphael and Albani as well as the newly-discovered frescoes at Pompeii. He represented the most fresh and attractive aspect of Neo-Classicism, a style often thought to be cold or monotonous. Despite being tucked away in a provincial town, the Palazzo Milzetti frescos arc continually full of surprises.They make light-hearted use of refined and always well-chosen colours. At the same time, the themes from classical mythology are not treated with pedantic crudition but with imaginative narrative freedom. It is only recently that critics rescued Giani from years of neglect. Today he is considered one of the most interesting figures on the official art scene during the Napoleonic era. Thanks to his never-failing good taste, he managed to cope with even the most difficult subjects. Nor did he limit himself to imitating classical art. On the contrary, he came up with new solutions which were definitely daring.This mural is in the ante-chamber to a bathroom ""along the lines of the Baths of Titus."

11017-411david.jpg	With The Distribution of the Eagle Standards, David's official work for Napoleon ended, and now he undertook private commissions. The painting Sappho and Phaon was commissioned by the wealthy Russian diplomat and art collector Prince Nicolas Yusupov, who lived in Paris from 1808 to 1811.Sappho was a poetess on the Greek island of Lesbos and her affection for the young women of the cult of Aphrodite was the origin of the word 'lesbian'. However, she fell in love with the beautiful youth Phaon, the prot�g� of Venus, and when he only briefly reciprocated her love, she leapt to her death from the rocks at Leucadia.Though this theme of legendary or mythological lovers was similar to that of The Loves of Paris and Helen of 1788, in this painting the couple are not totally self-absorbed and instead look out at the viewer, Phaon staring intensely and Sappho intoxicated with delight at her lover's touch. Indeed, so transported is she that she still believes herself to be playing the lyre that is now held by Cupid. For this picture about the power of physical love and its effect on the individual, David gave his lovers an almost portrait-like degree of characterization, placing them very close to the edge of the picture plane and near to the spectator. To add to the almost unreal sense of mythology come to life he also bathed the scene in harsh daylight and used bright colours and hard contours

12115-family.jpg	The portrait depicts the unidentified members of a family decked out in finery that denotes their wealth, rank, and relatively high social status: a mother and father in their early thirties and their six- or seven-year-old daughter. The theme of a mother and daughter performing the rituals of the morning toilette was fairly common in eighteen-century French portraiture. Jean-Marc Nattier exploited if in his Madame Marsollier and her Daughter, which was sent to the Salon of 1750 and surely had an impact on Drouais.

20544-nolime.jpg	This painting was one of the pinnacle panels of an altarpiece, probably painted for Santa Maria degli Angeli, the Camaldolese church of Florence, perhaps for the chapel founded in 1365 and dedicated to Ognissanti (All Saints). The altarpiece and its components have been variously attributed to members of the renowned family of Florentine painters: the brothers Andrea (known as Orcagna), Nardo, and Jacopo di Cione. The commission may have been given to Nardo in 1365 and taken over by Jacopo, following Nardo's death in 1366. The Cione brothers, especially Nardo, were involved in multiple commissions for Santa Maria degli Angeli.The central pinnacle panel depicting The Crucifixion is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York

06920-comtesse.jpg	Cabanel is inseparably associated with 'art pompier' - late French academicism that got its name from one or more of three sources: the similarity between the ancient helmets shown in its exponents' canvases and those worn by Parisian firemen (pompiers); its servile devotion to antiquity, one of whose symbols was Pompeii; or simply its tendency to treat any subject pompously. In this portrait of a Russian aristocrat, Comtesse de Keller (n�e Maria Ivanovna Riznich), the dramatic use of light and shade stresses the paleness of the model's skin and heightens her facial features, giving her the look of an actress strongly lit on stage			
05437-09fortit.jpg	The painting was commissioned for the Tribunale della Mercatanzia (a court where crimes of an economic nature were judged) and it was Botticelli's most prestigious work of the 1470s. The entire series of Virtues had been ordered from Piero del Pollaiolo.The figure of Fortitude is placed on a high throne with elaborately carved arms, a piece clearly traceable to Verocchio, but the feeling of tension that this thoughtful figure gives off surely comes from Antonio del Pollaiolo. The blue enamel work on the armour and the highlights on the metal are particularly interesting as they indicate a thorough knowledge of the goldsmith's art. The way in which the cloth is portrayed comes from Verocchio. The energy and vitality of the girl in armour, expressed in her face and her pose, is an original creation of Botticelli and shows clearly the very personal way in which he developed and enriched the styles of his contemporaries

11011-405david.jpg	The exact title of the painting is: Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon I and Coronation of the Empress Josephine in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris on 2 Dec 1804.David was commissioned by Napoleon to paint a large composition commemorating his consecration, which had taken place in Notre Dame in Paris, on 2 December 1804. The picture was exhibited in the Salon Carr� in the Louvre in 1808, then in the Salon of that year; it was next placed in the Tuileries, in the Salle des Gardes. Under Louis Philippe it was installed at Versailles in a room decorated in imitation of the Empire style, together with David's Distribution of the Eagles and Gros' Battle of Aboukir; in 1889 it was transferred to the Louvre, and its place at Versailles was taken by Roll's Marseillaise. In 1947 this latter picture was replaced by a replica of David's Consecration of Napoleon, begun by the painter in 1808 and not finished till 1822, in Brussels; this replica was bought by the Mus�es de France in England, in 1946.David seems to have derived his general composition from Rubens' Coronation of Queen Marie de Medici.In accordance with David's usual method, numerous studies, both painted and drawn, preceded the actual execution of the work. The best-known of these is the portrait of Pius VII, now in the Louvre. The painter then made a model, where he arranged dolls in costume.David had originally intended to portray the event faithfully, showing Napoleon crowning himself. The Emperor, remembering the quarrels between the Pope and the Holy Roman Empire, placed the crown on his own head to avoid giving a pledge of obedience of the temporal power to the Pontiff. But he evidently felt that it would not be desirable to perpetuate this somewhat disrespectful action in paint; so David painted the coronation of Josephine by Napoleon, with the Pope blessing the Empress.Grouped round the altar, near Napoleon, are the chief dignitaries &#151; Camb�c�res, the Lord Chancellor, Marshal Berthier, Grand Veneur, Talleyrand, the Lord Chamberlain, and Lebrun, the Chief Treasurer. Madame de la Rochefoucauld carries the Empress's train; behind her are the Emperor's sisters, and his brothers Louis and Joseph. In front of the central stand are some of the marshals, and in it is Marie Laetitia, Madame M�re (the Emperor's mother), who was in fact not present at the ceremony.

03752-011madon.jpg	"The series of ""Madonna and Child"" paintings, which constitute one of the most distinctive themes in Bellini's art, was started in his youthful years. Their execution and multiplication in the decades to come was the fruit of a considerable contribution by the busy workshop that would collaborate with the painter and to which some of the Madonnas, signed with the master's name for reasons of prestige, must be at least partially attributed. The incidence of this type of work was not peculiar to Bellini alone. Small and medium-small devotional images destined for private and family ownership were a distinctive feature of late 15th-century Venetian painting.Bellini's paintings are distinguished however by a strange, subtle tension that always binds the mother and child in a relationship of profound pathos. The models for these Madonnas were the numerous Byzantine and Graeco-Cretan icons which circulated in Venice, and which Bellini occasionally transposed with absolute precision. Yet the static stereotypes of the Eastern images were radically altered and reinterpreted by him with a lyricism and poetic sensibility that unmistakably animates the figures and puts them in intimate contact with the spectator.The still harsh Madonna and Child of the Museo Civico Malaspina in Pavia must be ascribed to around 1450-55. Originally assigned to Bartolomeo Vivarini, then to Bellini , then attributed to Lazzaro Bastiani, and finally to Bellini, this small panel is very closely related to the less disputed Madonna and Child of the John G. Johnson Collection in Philadelphia. The slender hands and iconic immobility still reveal the influence of Jacopo and the Vivarini family, while the boldy delineated line of the Child's figure and his transparent garment possibly derive from Squarcione, who was undoubtedly an inspiration to the young Bellini."

07484-14basket.jpg	"Caravaggio is reported to have claimed that he put as much effort into painting a vase of flowers as he did into painting human figures. Such an attitude not only calls into question the hierarchy of pictorial genres that had prevailed since Alberti, but also marks the beginning of a tradition of European still-life painting that was to develop continuously from then on.Whereas, until then, there had only been occasional cases of ""pure"" object paintings one by Carpaccio, a hunting trophy by Barbari and a message (1506) about one Antonio da Crevalcore, who is said to have made a ""painting full of fruit"" - from Caravaggio onwards, still-life was to be the most popular of genres. It is a response to the increase of private art collections and their demand for profane and virtuoso painting.Caravaggio compensated for the apparent loss of contentual gravity in an astonishing way. The basket is at eye level and juts out over the edge of the table into the real space of the spectator.In this formal exaggeration and with a viewpoint liberated from all attributive connotations, the otherwise trivial object takes on an unheard of monumentality that renders the secret lives of objects, the play of light on their surfaces and the variety of their textures worthy of such painting"

12278-verso20.jpg	The picture shows one of the 26 narrative scenes from the Stories of the Passion on the reverse side of the Maest&#224;. It is situated in the centre of the upper row.The emotional intensity of the Stories of the Passion, from Christ Taken Prisoner to the Way to Calvary, reaches its most dramatic moment in the Crucifixion which, placed in the middle of the upper row, dominates the whole of the back section. The slender cross stands out against the gold ground, dividing the crowd into two separate groups. On the left are Christ's followers, subdued and orderly, their faces drawn with grief, amongst whom are Mary of Clopas, Mary Mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene (dressed in red with her long hair unbound) and John the Evangelist. On the right, the priests and soldiers are shown mocking and insulting, with rough movements. The fine modelling of the figure of Christ is reminiscent of the plasticism of Gothic ivories, while the strong contrast of movement which opposes the characters has evident connections with the Crucifixion on the Cathedral pulpit, carved by Nicola Pisano from 1266-68. The surroundings are bare and scanty, the jagged rocks clearly alluding to Golgotha.

42312-1003vela.jpg	Vel�zquez stayed in Rome in 1649-50. Philip IV wanted his favourite court painter, now enjoying such a triumph in Rome, to paint his second wife, Queen Mariana, and to give his advice on the renovation of the old royal palace in Madrid, the Alc�zar. Consequently, he wished Vel�zquez to come back to court as soon as possible, but none the less the artist delayed his return for another whole year.The portrait of Queen Mariana required by the king was not completed until 1653. The queen was the daughter of Emperor Ferdinand III and Philip's sister the Infanta Maria, and had married her widowed uncle in 1649. She was nineteen at the time of this portrait, which shows her full length, wearing a black dress with silver braid, and of course adorned with much valuable jewellery: gold necklaces and bracelets, and a large gold brooch on her close-fitting bodice. Her right hand rests on the back of a chair, and she holds a delicate lace scarf in her left hand. The picture is bathed in harmonious shades of black and red, although the dramatically drawn curtain has been painted over by another hand.The composition turns on the focal point of the queen's alabaster skin and rouged face, small and almost doll-like under her hair, which is dressed very wide. Her bust, tightly encased in the bodice, her stiff farthingale and all her fashionable magnificence are rendered true to life by Vel�zquez, and at the same time he reveals them as a theatrical show concealing the girl's natural physical nature beneath the armour of courtly constraint

As one of the evangelists his attribute is a winged person resembling an angel, one of the 'apocalyptic beasts'. It may be seen dictating as Matthew writes. He has book, pen and inkhorn, the attributes of the writer. As an apostle he holds a purse, a reminder of his previous occupation. According to legend he was martyred by beheading and may therefore have an axe or halberd. Among Matthew's several inscriptions are 'Sanctam ecclesiam catholicam; sanctorum communionem' - 'The Holy Catholic Church; the communion of saints', from the Apostles' Creed; 'Primum querite regnum dei' - 'Set your mind on God's kingdom before everything else' (Matt. 6:33); 'Liber generationis Jesu Christi' - 'A table of the descent of Jesus Christ' (Matt. 1:1).

34300-theassum.jpg	Like many of his contemporaries, Sebastiano Ricci spent a large part of his life in travelling about Europe, painting works commissioned by secular and ecclesiastical authorities. After studying in Venice Ricci worked in Bologna, Parma and Rome, Milan and Florence, and was invited to the Imperial court in Vienna, where he worked on the Sch�nbrunn Palace. In 1712 he went to England where he decorated Chelsea Hospital Chapel and began work on Burlington House. The latter was finished by Kent when in 1716, reputedly angered at failing to obtain the commissions for decorating St Paul's Cathedral and Hampton Court, Ricci returned to Venice. He worked there for the rest of his life, embellishing the churches, religious houses and villas of the city and surrounding countryside with lavish works in gay colours.The Assumption is one of Ricci's latest works, painted shortly before his death in 1734 for the Karlskirche, the most beautiful Baroque church in Vienna. The sketch for this composition, also acquired by the Budapest Museum, is an exquisite and poetic work, delicately executed with light strokes of the brush

The man to the left, seated in a chair next to what are presumably his mason's tools, is showing his cards confidently to his opponent, but in fact he is looking directly and calmly at the viewer, tilting his cards in our direction, as if to involve us in his imminently awaited triumph.

13460-self_por.jpg	This resolute likeness most probably represents Carel Fabritius only months before he was fatally wounded in his studio in Delft by the explosion of a gunpowder magazine on 12 October 1654. (The aftermath of the disaster is recorded in a painting by Egbert van der Poel also in the National Gallery.) The son of a schoolmaster and Sunday painter who may have taught him the rudiments of the art, Fabritius studied with Rembrandt between around 1641 and 1643. Only eight certainly authentic works by him survive. The National Gallery is fortunate in owning two: this portrait, and a curious small View of Delft which may have formed part of a perspective box or peepshow. Fabritius is also recorded as having made illusionistic perspective wallpaintings, but none is known.Fabritius proved to be Rembrandt's most gifted and original pupil. At the time of his death at 32 he had already evolved a style and technique at variance with his teacher's. While Rembrandt normally - although not invariably - set his sitters in light against a dark background, Fabritius's silhouette looms starkly against a cloudy sky impastoed white highlights on the metal thrusting the cuirass forward in space. His preparation of the canvas was also quite different. Rembrandt preferred a double ground, a cool grey superimposed over orange-red; analysis has shown that the single ground of this picture is a light cream colour.Rembrandt had painted himself wearing a military breastplate or gorget - a collarlike piece of armour - in the late 1620s and 1630s, and this became a popular type of self portrait among his pupils. Its significance has been much debated, some scholars arguing that it suggests Dutch patriotism, a readiness to champion the homeland's hard-won independence, others denying that any such topical meaning could have been intended. Military armour, like pastoral costume, Italian Renaissance or Burgundian dress, was thought to be less susceptible to the vagaries of fashion than civilian outdoor wear, and thus more 'timeless'. Fabritius's fur cap also seems anachronistic, its shape closer to the outline of sixteenth-century headgear than to contemporary hats. But perhaps Rembrandt's invention of a timeless or heroic type of portrait had a more personal significance for Fabritius.His surname, sometimes used by his father and adopted by the artist by 1641, is derived from the Latin word faber, meaning manual workman, and was applied to smiths, building workers and carpenters. Fabritius worked as a carpenter before entering Rembrandt's studio, and a probable self portrait of about 1648-9 showing him in coarse working dress (now in Rotterdam) has been interpreted as alluding both to his former occupation and to his name. 'Fabritius' has, however, another, altogether grander significance. C(aius) Fabritius or Fabricius was a soldier and consul of the Roman republic, celebrated for frugality, courage and integrity. His story was familiar from Plutarch's account, and a fellow student in Rembrandt's studio was later to paint an episode from his life in Amsterdam Town Hall. The last records of C(arel) Fabritius in Delft speak of mounting debts but growing professional recognition. If the Rotterdam picture depicts Fabritius/faber the craftsman-painter, might not the National Gallery portrait recall the man of whom Virgil wrote 'Fabricius, poor, yet a prince'

37205-3mercy.jpg	The Madonna of Mercy from Vertine is a splendid tempera painting only recently attributed (and not unanimously) to Simone. Here, we can still clearly see the influence of Duccio, especially in the positioning and typology of the characters sheltered under Mary's cloak. But a new spirit prevails: a sense of real space between the heads and a feeling of life and movement in the imposing figure of the Virgin (the drapery folds do not conceal the position of her legs and she is quite noticeably turning in order to embrace all her prot�g�s) are evidence of the evolution of the artist's more archaic ideas towards new forms of expression.The effect of rich and precious ornamentation (a striking feature of the Maest&#224;) is reproduced in the use of gold and silver, colourful gems set in the surface, and transparent varnishes. Although we cannot be sure that this Madonna was actually painted by Simone, no one can deny the analogies, both in technique and style, with Madonna no. 583

18925-2dido_ae.jpg	Dido was, in Roman mythology, the queen of Carthage. She was the daughter of a king of Tyre. After her brother Pygmalion murdered her husband, she fled to Libya, where she founded and ruled Carthage.

36409-virgin_p.jpg	Like Carlo Dolci, Giovanni Battista Salvi, called Sassoferrato from his birthplace in the Marches, had close ties with the Benedictines. Their motto, ora et labora, 'pray and work', seems as fitting to him as it does to his devout Florentine contemporary. Like Dolci, he relied on the compositional inventions of others: fifteenth- and sixteenth-century artists such as Perugino, D�rer, Tintoretto, Lo Spagna; contemporaries, above all Reni; and the fashionable Madonnas painted in Rome by the Frenchman Mignard. His work has often been mistaken for that of a follower of Raphael, so closely did he model himself on the 'pure' style of an earlier age. After he had copied some pictures for the Benedictine monastery in Perugia at the age of 21, he was introduced to a reformed Franciscan friary in Rome, the city in which he lived for some forty years and where he died. A pious princess commissioned his one famous altarpiece, for the Dominican church of Santa Sabina in Rome, to replace a precious Raphael which the Dominicans unwisely sold to a collector.With the exception of some portraits of devout ecclesiastics, and a self portrait commissioned by a cardinal in 1683 for Duke Cosimo III de' Medici's gallery of artists' likenesses, Sassoferrato made his living from devotional pictures such as this one. Most were made in 'multiple originals', on commission and for sale to pilgrims. This popular composition, based on an engraving purported to be after Reni, is known in over fifteen variants.Sassoferrato suffers in our estimation partly for being the kind of self-abnegating artist we least admire, and partly because his pictures directly influenced the pious art of the nineteenth century in all its sentimental excess. Yet his own work is too robust to be sentimental, and too well painted. The enamel-like finish, the jewel brightness of white, red, costly ultramarine blue on black, preclude neither vigorous modelling of form nor acute observation - as of the pale reflections of the Virgin's veil in the shadows on her face and cheek.Sassoferrato is catering to the Counter-Reformation reaffirmation of the cult of the Virgin and of the efficacy of her images, in the same spirit in which histories and atlases of these miracle-working icons were being compiled and published throughout Europe. The Virgin in Prayer, her veil leaning out of the painting into our space, is praying over us, for us, as an example to us, in submission to the will of the Father, to the Son. She has been abstracted from narratives of the Annunciation, the Adoration, the Nativity, so that we may pray through her, lose our fretful egoism in her infinite mercy and humility, as the artist has submerged his handwriting in the icon. Her eyes are lowered, but if we look up at her from a hassock or a prie-dieu, a sickbed or a deathbed, her tender glance will fall on us. She is alone, without the Child, our mother, our nurse, intercessor on our behalf, and Sassoferrato's message is that to submit to her is to reclaim our strength, our freedom and our dignity

17751-403goya.jpg	This belongs to a series of representations of the four Doctors of the Church, of which the St Augustine and St Ambrose are also extant. They are not documented but are reasonably assumed to have been painted after Goya's visit to Andalusia in 1796-97 both on stylistic grounds and because of their resemblance to Murillo's seated figures of St Isidore and St Leander in Seville Cathedral. In style and colour they also reflect Goya's earlier studies of Tiepolo.Goya's St Gregory, seated on a platform like Murillo's saints, is a monumental figure in an undefined space, without decor or attributes other than the large book and papal tiara to identify him as the pope said to have left the greatest number of writings.

08021-mass_mat.jpg	In 1664 the Trinitarian order in Pamplona completed a new monastic complex and turned Carre&#241;o and Francisco Rizi to paint the altarpiece for the church. The Trinitarian order had been founded in the late twelfth century by the Frenchman John of Matha, and the altarpiece illustrates a key moment in his career. As St John of Matha raised the host during his first mass, he saw a vision of a young boy dressed in white (here converted into an angel), with arms crossed and hands resting on the heads of two prisoners, one a Christian, one a Moor. From this vision the saint divined his earthly mission, to establish a religious order devoted to the redemption of Christian prisoners.The composition was designed by Rizi but it is signed and dated only by Carre&#241;o. The composition is set within a monumental space, opening at the right on a serene, luminous landscape.

His right hand, part of the banderole, his wings and the fluttering ends of his belt are all cut off by the edge of the picture.

He persuaded him to sit for three paintings and two drawings, and in return gave him advice on his painting. Van Gogh painted his friend in full Zouave uniform, brilliant in colour and exotic in style. He wrote to his brother of the difficulties he had encountered in managing the harsh and incongruous colours of the uniform, but explained that he liked to be working on vulgar, loud portraits such as this one. The appeal of the Zouave as a subject for a modern portrait lay not only in his non-bourgeois and non-urban crudity but also in his association with the South.

35333-edgefore.jpg	The tame mode of Th�odore Rousseau's landscapes disconcerted both the public and the critics. From 1835 to 1848 his pictures were rejected by the jury of the Salon.Rousseau painted nature for its own sake, pursuing realism and expressiveness, endowing an otherwise dull landscape with poetic feeling, eschewing anecdotal devices or literary references. After scouring the French countryside, he found ideal spots to paint in the forest of Fontainebleau, near the village of Barbizon, which allowed him to fully express his feelings and emotions.

He was, in short, a man of his time.The art of Dossi gives us images of expanded masses, bright colours, and abstruse, bizarre light effects. This painting, however, which at first sight looks classical and traditional, requires individual explanation. The figure portrayed here with the emblems of a man at arms, reminds us of Giorgione, it is true - which may cause confusion in the attribution of the painting because of the male face stricken with a suffused melancholy - yet the metallic flashing of the light makes the figure alive and at the same time rather disturbing: a strange assemblage of reality and fantasy

18276-0815grec.jpg	There are many versions of The Agony in the Garden painted by El Greco and his workshop, it was one of his most successful inventions. He painted the subject both as a horizontal and as a vertical composition. The version in the Ohio museum is probably the prototype, or at least the best autograph version of the horizontal type.The Agony in the Garden testifies to an astonishing development of the artist. The Italian influences recede to the same degree as El Greco frees himself from his obligation to nature. The figures lose their sense of substance, while their expressiveness is amplified by the unreal shapes assumed by the landscape. Thus Christ is literally heightened by the rock behind him, while the disciples are seen in a sheltering cave as a symbol of sleep. The figures are absolved from logical relationships of scale. The falling diagonal which leads from an angel, through Christ, to the soldiers on the right-hand edge of the painting is a visual statement of the inevitability of Christ's fate. Such departures from the natural model, also evident in the visionary apparition of the moon, were one of the major reasons for the revival of interest in El Greco's work around 1900

38497-artemisi.jpg	The love between Artemisia II and her brother Mausolus was so profound, they became symbols of love and devotion. Mausolus was a rich Greek vassal of the Persian Empire in what is now Turkey. Under the reign of he and his sister, their territory flourished, and they built many monuments. Their final monument was so glorious, it became known as one of the seven wonders of the world: a giant tomb, to house their ashes. When her brother Mausolus died, Artemisia's grief was so great that she ritually drank a bit of his ashes every day.

18321-1209grec.jpg	Christ on the Cross, at the moment of expiration, with the Virgin and Saint John, and at the foot of the Cross, the Magdalene. Probably originally above the Annunciation, in the retable of the Colegio of Do&#241;a Mar�a. This painting and the Annunciation are the two widest of the series.Already, in Santo Domingo el Antiguo, the artist had sensibly related together in composition the two central paintings of the high altar, the Assumption and Trinity. Again, there is this compositional relationship of the two paintings, but there is also something more in this bringing together of the two so diverse yet intimately related themes of the Virgin's reception of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's giving up of the Holy Ghost. One subject represents one of the Joys of the Virgin, and the other incorporates one of Her Griefs. Each painting is divided horizontally in three. The figure of Christ of the Expiration is a continuation upwards of the central zone of the Annunciation with the Flames and the Dove; the figure of the Archangel Gabriel has its counterpart in the figure of Saint John; and the Virgin of Joy appears above as the Virgin of Grief.This painting of the Crucifixion is one of the great interpretations of the subject in painting and almost inevitably brings to mind two other great Crucifixions, Gr�newald's of the Isenheim Altar and Giotto's of the Arena Chapel. El Greco has introduced more of those symbols embodying spiritual emotions: the clamouring angels with outstretched arms encircling the Body of Christ - strangely recalling Giotto's painting - and the remarkable figure of the angel at the foot of the Cross.

07501-272y_ram.jpg	In this picture the totally naked boy sits leaning far back, like one of the 'ignudi' who adorn Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling. Here, he is propping his left elbow on some white drapery, has straightened out his left leg behind him, and is supporting his bent right leg by gripping the toes. A magnificent piece of red fabric provides pictorial ornament, at the bottom on the left. The Baptist's body is so firmly embedded in the yielding hide of his coarse garment that the energetically black contours from his upper thigh to his back stand out in a clear flow of lines. With his right arm, the boy is reaching for a ram which has suddenly materialized from the depth of the picture. Its nose and mouth are nearly touching the smiling boy's cheek.Caravaggio clearly based the figure on Michelangelo's example, though he painted it according to his own principles of working direct from a living model. The figure does not reveal the great Florentine's feeling for musculature, but the vigorous contouring of his back shows his influence. Caravaggio is likely to have used a study here. With great skill and his instinct for dynamic action, Caravaggio has placed the carefully built-up body in such a way that the figure's left elbow almost bumps against the edge of the picture. Otherwise, however, the figure is completely free. This enables the apparition in the light to develop dynamically from top left towards the right
