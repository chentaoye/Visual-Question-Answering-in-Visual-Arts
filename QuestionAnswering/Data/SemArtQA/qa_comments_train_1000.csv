42249-0317vela.jpg	In the eighteenth century this painting was attributed either to Rubens or his pupil Van Dyck. The mistaken attribution is not surprising. Through their close study of Titian, the naturalness of their approach, the immediacy of their portrayals, and their depth of psychological penetration, the portraits of the mature Vel�zquez come far closer to Van Dyck than to any of his Spanish contemporaries. The parallels extend even to the thin, almost sketchy manner in which the two artists applied their paint.In this portrait, the man's hair hangs over his ears like a veil, and Vel�zquez has deliberately incorporated the ground here as part of the effect. He is content with economical strokes, dashed off lightly but with the utmost confidence, to indicate the details of the garments

12158-maest_01.jpg	The Madonna appears on the panel as the Queen of the Heaven and Siena. In the foreground the four patron saints of Siena are kneeling: Sts Ansanus, Savinus, Crescentius and Victor. The Latin inscription on the base of the throne contains the name of the painter.The movements of the heavenly court are articulated with subtle symmetry: the characters surrounding the Virgin are divided into two ranks by the throne, which is the central axis of the entire composition. The mirror-like correspondence of the two sides is broken up by tiny details (the gestures of the saints or the glance of an angel).Next to the angels, from left to right, are saints Catherine of Alexandria, Paul, John the Evangelist (left side), John the Baptist, Peter, and Agnes (right side), recognizable by their symbols and names painted on the lower edge (the inscriptions are missing only for Paul and Peter). On the bottom row are the four patron saints, also identifiable by their names: Ansano, baptizer of the Sienese and decapitated in the Val d'Arbia in the fourth century; Savino, a martyred bishop (left side); Crescenzio, a boy martyred under Diocletian, whose remains were transferred to the Cathedral in 1058; Victor, a Christian soldier, native of Syria, proclaimed patron after 1288 (right side).Above, in little arches whose frames have been lost, are the apostles distinguished by their abbreviated names against the gold background. Again from left, they are, Thaddeus, Simon, Philip, James the Great, Andrew (left side), Matthew, James the Less, Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthias (right side). The use of gold as a precious complement to the glorification of Mary is essential. The background, the haloes, the garments of the Child, of Catherine, Savino, and Agnes, the cloth covering the back of the throne and the Cosmatesque inlays of the latter, all dazzle the onlooker with their splendid glitter. The fabric of the garments and the backcloth axe embroidered with a continuous small golden pattern which gives the effect of real material. Little space is left for the use of other colours

31984-1deposa.jpg	The Deposition can perhaps justly be described as the artist's masterpiece. The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and drapes that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background. This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Piet&#224; or Lamentation over the Dead Christ. The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap. The Virgin, visibly distraught, and perhaps on the point of fainting, still glazes longingly towards her Son, and gestures with her right arm in the same direction. In the centre of the painting, the moment of the separation is underlined by the subtle contact of Mary's legs with those of Christ, now freed from his Mother's last pathetic embrace. The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Piet&#224; (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin. Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father. The general direction of the movement is, in fact, a rising one, and is created by the ethereal quality of the weightless figures, and their slow, almost dance-like rhythm. The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens. The transparent shadows do not annul the colours, but actually become them, in the flesh tones invested with subtle shades of pink and green.The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself. Staring at something beyond the confines of the painting and looking as though he were about to leave the pictorial space, he presents us with this complex and refined decoration of colours, forms

23344-08madon.jpg	This painting shows the influence of Palma Vecchio. In the 15th century Venetian painting Giovanni Bellini and Antonello da Messina developed the perfect and much followed type of the subject of  Madonna with a group of saints. The group was alway composed symmetrically in an architectural setting. At the beginning of the next century this composition scheme was loosened and the group was frequently set in a landscape.The represented saints are Catherine of Alexandria and Thomas. The latter is usually called James the Greater, whose attribute is a pilgrim's staff. However, the object depicted is a spear, therefore the saint must be the apostle Thomas. Indeed, he was identified as such in a catalogue of the Austrian imperial collection of 1783

29858-holyfami.jpg	The infant running to his mother initiates a diagonal train of movement which leads through Mary to the kindly, ageing Joseph behind. The grouping of the main figures thus introduces both asymmetry and depth to the pictorial plane. With great artistic intelligence, Orley balances this on the left by means of the two angels parallel to the plane, one approaching with a wicker basket of flowers and one hovering overhead and bearing a golden crown. Christ serves to link together the various elements of the painting. His left hand reaches up to his mother's shoulder, his eyes are raised towards the crown with which he will one day make Mary Queen of Heaven, while his right arm gestures towards the apple in Joseph's hand - a symbol of the sin which Jesus has come to conquer.Orley can here be seen as a painter mediating between two stylistic eras. While lovingly executed details of material and texture remain the prominent focus of his interest, he also acknowledges the masters of the High Renaissance in his skilful balancing of depth and plane and in his delicate gradation of colour in the receding landscape. Orley is known both as a painter of large altarpieces and as a portraitist

05710-extensi1.jpg	This painting shows an extensive river landscape with figures around a village with a town in the distance. A group of figures in the foreground stop to converse on a well-travelled road. Beyond them, two people make their way along the path leading towards a lake, where more figures and two horses are faintly identifiable. Near the lake, the edge of a town can be seen and in the centre of the painting, a building is nestled within the landscape in front of which stand a herd of cows and a farmer. To their right, a river meanders its way through the craggy landscape where further buildings are situated. This painting and its pair, the Extensive Mountainous Landscape, are examples of the Flemish landscape genre.

07261-canal711.jpg	The Order of the Bath is one of the oldest English chivalric orders; it is thought to have been founded in 1399. Canaletto here has painted the procession of newly installed Knights of the Order from Westminster Abbey to the House of Lords which took place on 20 June 1749. He was commissioned to paint the picture by Joseph Wilcocks, Dean of Westminster, and it has remained since it was executed in the Deanery.The knights have emerged from the west end of the Abbey and walk round past St Margaret's church, beyond which can be seen the roof of Westminster Hall. The Abbey is shown after its recent restoration and the construction of the two west towers, an undertaking which was carried out by the architects Nicholas Hawksmoor and Sir Christopher Wren, and the picture in many ways acts as much as a commemoration of their achievements, as of the ceremony.Canaletto may have based his depiction of the event on descriptions, rather than actually having witnessed it: the resplendent knights are impressive, but they are rather stilted in arrangement, and their scale in relation to the architecture is not completely convincing

19916-03denmar.jpg	Holbein's painting of the sixteen-year-old Christina of Denmark, widowed Duchess of Milan, is his only surviving full-length portrait of a woman. Remarkably for a work of this period, we know precisely how and when it came to be made. The younger daughter of King Christian II of Denmark, an early Lutheran sympathiser who lost his throne in 1523, she had been brought up in the Netherlands at the courts of her great-aunt, Margaret of Austria, Governess of the Netherlands until her death in 1530, and her aunt, Mary of Hungary, Margaret's successor and sister of the Emperor Charles V. After her husband's death in 1535, Christina returned to Brussels. Henry VIII of England attempted, unsuccessfully in the event, to marry her as his fourth wife after the death of Jane Seymour. On 12 March 1538 she agreed to sit for Holbein for three hours, and the English envoy judged the resulting drawing or drawings to be `very perfect'. Holbein must have worked up the painted portrait after his return to London, and the king was said to be `in love' with Christina, whom of course he had never met except through Holbein's art. It has been suggested that the full-face pose, characteristic of Holbein's other portraits of Henry's prospective brides, was chosen on instructions from the king, who may have felt that any other view might allow blemishes to be concealed from him.The figure stands out isolated against the plain but brightly coloured background relieved only by shadows, cast not merely by Christina herself but by an unseen window frame. Since the black mourning dress carried no ornament, Holbein stressed the three-dimensional modelling, creating enlivening patterns from the reflection of light on the folds of the silken robe. Not known as a great beauty, Christina was, however, much praised for the elegance of her hands, and in this area of the painting Holbein suggests the different textures of linen, velvet, fur, leather, gold and gemstone to set off the delicate beauty of the flesh. Christina's faint smile seems at once demure and intimate. Generations of viewers have shared Henry's infatuation with this engaging portrait

21539-family.jpg	Largilli�re's normal handling of paint is matched by a freedom and naturalness in the settings of many of his portraits, with often gracefully rustic, open-air scenery anticipatory more of Gainsborough's portraits than of any vein of later French portraiture. The Portrait of a Family has about it an informality and relaxation which the rich costume of the mother and daughter cannot disguise, unsuitable though it appears for such a deeply countrified location. The father, with his gun, dead game, and lively-eyed hound, is more suitably set. But all this is a tribute to the sensitivity of Largilli�re's response - to the setting as much as to his human sitters. He 'portrays' the rugged bark of the oak tree at the right of the composition and the curling shapes of its russet-tinted leaves with a directness unprepared for in French painting

Most striking is a sizable turbot with head and tail tied together with a thread to keep it fresh.Painting fish in a lifelike manner was an exceptional challenge for a painter. Depicting the shiny skin in a convincing manner was not simple.

31830-mercury.jpg	Ovid (Met. 2:708-832) tells how three sisters, returning from the festival of Minerva and carrying her sacred baskets on their heads, were espied by Mercury who immediately fell in love with the most beautiful of them, Herse. Another of the sisters, Aglauros, was consumed with envy, and tried to prevent Mercury entering Herse's chamber when he came to her one night. He touched Aglauros with his wand and she turned to black stone, the colour of her thoughts.This painting depicts the scene when the maidens are walking outdoors, Mercury flying above them. In the background is Minerva's temple. The small painting was formerly attributed to Bartholomeus Breenbergh, a contemporary of Poelenburgh.

In the centre of the polyptych is God the Father in Glory with the Lamb, between the symbols of the four Evangelists.The ineffably expressive naturalness which makes the central panel of Alberegno's signed triptych so admirable appears again in the panels of the Polyptych with five episodes from the Apocalypse, originally placed in the church of St. John the Evangelist at Torcello. In the central panel for example, where St. John the Evangelist looks up from his writing to admire the Eternal in glory with the Lamb of God, surrounded by the symbols of the four Evangelists with wings covered with eyes, being worshipped by twenty-four venerable old men, here too the theme, though very complex, comes through with exemplary clarity because of the subtle expressiveness of the details which frees the sacred vision of every transcendent abstraction

17986-09scene.jpg	"The concluding four pictures start in the third row of the right north wall. The picture fields become narrower towards the top, as they are the lunettes of the individual walls. For this reason, and because of the greater distance from the viewer, Benozzo only depicts one event in each picture in the upper row. There is, however, one exception: the stigmatisation takes place in two picture fields. In this way, Benozzo honours St Francis of Assisi as the most important of the saints bearing the stigmata.The picture shows the birth of Christ being celebrated in the monastery of Greccio. St Francis, who is kneeling in the foreground inside a church, is lovingly cradling the crib figure of the Christ Child in his arms, thus bringing it to life. The faithful who have gathered to celebrate mass notice the miracle and are gazing in reverence and astonishment at the scene.The Establishment of the Manger at Greccio, probably the most impressive picture in the cycle, takes place in a church interior that is constructed according to the laws of central perspective. The vanishing point lies behind the third pilaster in the rear wall. The perspective, therefore, is not used in the sense of a ""symbolic form"", according to which the central motif of the picture - the spiritual closeness of the saint and the Christ Child - would have to appear at the vanishing point. The motionless figures of the faithful and St Francis and the animals resting in the stable in Bethlehem support the static composition of the picture and give the event an air of sacred solemnity. The architecture of the church interior is composed of two different stylistic epochs: the tracery windows and pointed arches are Gothic architectural forms, while the fluted pilasters, straight cornices and oculus windows are architectural elements typical of the Early Renaissance.The legend of St Francis written by St Bonaventure tells us about the Christmas celebrations in Greccio. It has been shown that Greccio, which lies a little beyond the southern border of Umbria, near Rieti in northern Latium, was the first place where a manger was set up.The inscription added beneath the picture reads: QUANDO BS. F. FECIT REPRESENTATIONEM NATIVITATIS ET AP(P)ARVIT SIBI CHRISTUS IN BRACHIIS - ""How St. Francis arranged for a representation of Christmas and the Christ Child appeared in his arms."

23161-reliquar.jpg	In 1402 the city fathers of San Gimignano commissioned from the Florentine painter Lorenzo di Niccol&#242; di Martino a wooden shrine to receive the head of the young local saint St Fina. On the walls of this reliquary the girl's life and the miracles attributed to her after her death are recounted in eight scenes. Fina is here shown with a saint's halo and carrying a model of San Gimignano on her arm, indicating that at that time she was already venerated as one of the city's patron saints. The episodes from the life of the saint painted on the outside of the reliquary are based on a narrative written by Fra Giovanni del Coppo as early as roughly 1310. On the front of the reliquary Pope Gregory the Great is represented beside St Fina

32946-05farne.jpg	"The Sienese Banker, Agostini Chigi, played a very important role in the cultural and artistic activities which flourished around Julius II. His house was built on the outskirts of Rome in 1509-1510, and was designed as a model of luxury and elegance. He commissioned the most famous artists of the time, Baldassare Peruzzi, Sebastiano Luciani (later called Sebastiano del Piombo) and Raphael himself to decorate it. All three painted frescoes based on classical mythology in Chigi's house (which was later acquired by the Farnese family and came to be known as ""La Farnesina"").As subject Raphael chose a verse from a poem by the Florentine Angelo Poliziano which had also helped to inspire Botticelli's 'Birth of Venus'. These lines describe how the clumsy giant Polyphemus sings a love song to the fair sea-nymph Galatea and how she rides across the waves in a chariot drawn by two dolphins, laughing at his uncouth song, while the gay company of other sea-gods and nymphs is milling round her.Raphael's fresco shows Galatea with her gay companions; the giant is depicted in a fresco by Sebastiano del Piombo which stands to the left of Raphael's Galatea. However long one looks at this lovely and cheerful picture, one will always discover new beauties in its rich and intricate composition. Every figure seems to correspond to some other figure, every movement to answer a counter-movement.To start with the small boys with Cupid's bows and arrows who aim at the heart of the nymph: not only do those to right and left echo each other's movements, but the boy swimming beside the chariot corresponds to the one flying at the top of the picture. It is the same with the group of sea-gods which seems to be 'wheeling' round the nymph. There are two on the margins, who blow on their sea-shells, and two pairs in front and behind, who are making love to each other. But what is more admirable is that all these diverse movements are somehow reflected and taken up in the figure of Galatea herself. Her chariot had been driving from left to right with her veil blowing backwards, but, hearing the strange love song, she turns round and smiles, and all the lines in the picture, from the love-gods' arrows to the reins she holds, converge on her beautiful face in the very centre of the picture.By these artistic means Raphael has achieved constant movement throughout the picture, without letting it become restless or unbalanced. It is for this supreme mastery of arranging his figures, this consummate skill in composition, that artists have admired Raphael ever since. Just as Michelangelo was found to have reached the highest peak in the mastery of the human body, Raphael was seen to have accomplished what the older generation had striven so hard to achieve: the perfect and harmonious composition of freely moving figures.There was another quality in Raphael's work that was admired by his contemporaries and by subsequent generations - the sheer beauty of his figures. When he had finished the 'Galatea', Raphael was asked by a courtier where in all the world he had found a model of such beauty. He replied that he did not copy any specific model but rather followed ""a certain idea"" he had formed in his mind. To some extent, then, Raphael, like his teacher Perugino, had abandoned the faithful portrayal of nature which had been the ambition of so many Quattrocento artists. He deliberately used an imagined type of regular beauty. If we look back to the time of Praxiteles, we remember how what we call an ""ideal"" beauty grew out of a slow approximation of schematic forms to nature. Now the process was reversed. Artists tried to modify nature according to the idea of beauty they had formed when looking at classical statues - they ""idealized"" the model. It was a tendency not without its dangers, for, if the artist deliberately ""improves on"" nature, his work may easily look mannered or insipid. But if we look once more at Raphael's work, we see that he, at any rate, could idealize without any loss of vitality and sincerity in the result. There is nothing schematic or calculated in Galatea's loveliness. She is an inmate of a brighter world of love and beauty - the world of the classics as it appeared to its admirers in sixteenth-century Italy"

The oblique wooden ceiling of the mansard room forms the strongest diagonal accent in a composition that is otherwise determined by a quiet contrast of horizontals and verticals. On the back wall of the room, there is a full bookcase, and books are piled on the desk at the left. A number of other everyday things are distributed picturesquely around the room. Light falls into the interior from two windows on opposite walls whose shutters open into the room.

43742-marengo.jpg	The English painter could not have given a more apt or dramatic depiction of Napoleon's fall from power than in this psychological image of his tragic fate. Marengo was Napoleon's horse. We see it fretting to and fro, trembling on the brink, as it looks out over the see for its lost rider. The animal's emotional state mirrors the catastrophic events. Lonely, riderless, and unsaddled, the stallion's fear is visible in its eyes, the restless unease expressed in every muscle of its body. The distant horizon present under the darkening evening sky, into which the former wold conqueror has had to flee, leaving his faithful steed behind, is the metaphor in the painting for the historic event

33893-08noremb.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 435.Rembrandt, born in Leiden, was not only a giant of seventeenth-century painting - he remains one of the supreme painters of the world. He never left Holland, never visited Italy, and sought no favours from foreign rulers. In his dark, simple landscapes the emphasis may fall on a windmill, the ruins of a castle, a few trees, and in the paintings with Old Testament themes, on ancient prophets, or Biblical heroines, men at war with the divine commandments, or with themselves, or with their fate. He painted the faces of eternal human tragedy: the return of the Prodigal Son, Bathsheba surrendering to her inevitable fate, Saul moved by David's psalms, and the figure of Dana&#235; offering herself to the shower of gold.The enfeebled rabbi is sitting among his books, hands clasped, gazing into space. Wise and timeless, he can no longer feel the mortality of his body, the weight of age. He is bound to this world solely by the strength of his spirit.This painting was probably executed by a painter in Rembrandt's circle

28744-angler.jpg	De Moor's genre pictures partake of Leiden traditions, though not exclusively those of the fijnschilders. However, his Angler of about 1700 is virtually unique among his limited number of genre works and, indeed, among seventeenth-century Dutch genre paintings in general. In a bucolic setting, a barefoot youth reclining beside a pond or canal gazes at his fishing line whilst observed by a milkmaid - identifiable as such by her attire &#151; and her pipe-smoking companion who lean upon a rough-hewn rail. De Moor's relatively precise application of paint enhances the physical refinement of the protagonists who exhibit porcelain-like skin and, in the case of the fisherboy, an aquiline nose. His urchin's tattered garments and rustic hat seem incongruous with his smooth, pure form almost as if he were an actor donning a costume for a stage production set in the country

13641-18ferenc.jpg	"Since Ferenczy had been appointed a teacher, he started to paint more and more studio genres, e.g. still lives, nudes and portraits, and before very long,  his interest turned to portraits. ""Double Portrait""  is a good example which demonstrates his decorative skills. Ferenczy enjoyed painting portraits of groups, some of his works from his late period were portraits of two or three people. His portraits were not just elaborate character portrayals, but compositions: he realized his ideas on composition. ""Double Portrait"" shows his 18-year-old twins, No�mi and B�ni. The picture is rich in authentic details of character. He painted the clothes of his children, No�mi's dress with lace and B�ni's grey pullover, with delicate care. No�mi's white dress is a warm patch in front of the blue background. Greys and blacks of B�ni's clothes might  fade the picture, but the white and red folk art cushion restores balance. The composition is based on silhouette: a blue curtain closes space behind the figures, thus their silhouettes become more definite"

03517-samsonde.jpg	Batoni painted relatively few Old Testament subjects during his career - less than a dozen over a fifty year stretch. One of these, Samson and Delilah exemplifies Batoni's style in the third quarter of the century as he gradually progressed toward the pictorial qualities of his last years. The deliberate prettiness, opulent finish and brilliant colour of the early history paintings have yielded to a manner of expression in which the forms are more faintly coloured, the opulence and sumptuousness are restrained, and the handling is drier and less rich. The composition is typical of the later work, simpler and narrower in depth and dominated by verticality, and the figures are considerably elongated

18123-theorbo.jpg	Like many Carraveggesque works, The Theorbo Player was once attributed to the master himself, but it is now recognised as one of the masterpieces of Antiveduto Gramatica. In the painting, a musician, looking over his left shoulder, is seated in front of a table upon which a Spanish guitar, tambourine and musical score rest. The rich density of the palette and the keen rendering of the instruments reflect Caravaggio's naturalism, while the composition itself is obviously based directly on his Lute Player. Gramatica's painting is a fragment of a larger Concert (known through photographs of a copy, now lost), in which the theorbo player turns towards a woman playing the harpsichord and a young boy playing the flute. The musicians' intense concentration and sideways glances become clear once their original context within the larger Concert is understood. There are clear traces of overpaint on the left-hand side of the Turin picture, covering the area where the woman's shoulder and arm once were.A painting of a concert 'by the hand of Antiveduto' is listed in the 1627 inventory of Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte's collection. The dimensions given in the inventory correspond to those of the lost copy, making it probable that the Turin picture was cut from Cardinal Del Monte's Concert. The picture has been placed early in Gramatica's career, around 1605. However, the combination of a theorbo and Spanish guitar suggest that the picture should be dated in the second decade of the seventeenth century, after these two instruments had become more fashionable.

30726-cyrus.jpg	Cyrus was, according to the writings of Herodotus, the founder of the Persian Empire in the 6th Century BCE. Astyages, the king of Media, and grandfather of Cyrus, ordered that his infant grandchild be slain in an attempt to thwart a prophecy that his grandson would one day overthrow him. A kinsman, Harpagus, was entrusted with the murder, but unable to kill the child, instead left the baby with a local shepherd to be exposed on a mountainside. The shepherd's wife substituted her own stillborn child for the infant Cyrus and raised Cyrus as her own.Recognized and returned to his true parents after being brought before the king, his grandfather, as a poor shepherd for insulting a nobleman's son, Astyages at the same time punished Harpagus for disobeying his order to kill the child. Harpagus as a result plotted with Cyrus to overthrow Astyages, eventually succeeding in the conquest of Media and the formation of the Persian Empire

19702-view_dog.jpg	Among the wide range of still-life and flower painting formats that Tom�s Hiepes developed were garden scenes, showing figures and animals in the corner of a garden courtyard. The setting of this painting with cultivated flowers in pots in the corner of a paved garden, and with its distinctive tiled bench, appears in other paintings by Hiepes and suggests that it represents a corner of a real garden in Valencia, perhaps his own. Hiepes appears to have been alone among Spanish flower painters in representing flowers growing in such pots. It is likely that this format was his own invention, possibly arrived at in response to his own particular circumstances in Valencia, a city famous in the 17th century for its gardens, flowers and fruits

00892-10east.jpg	The lunette represents two scenes: St Stephen being led to His Martyrdom; Stoning of St Stephen.Stephen had been blessed by the Apostles and was the first to be ordained as deacon. Accused of blasphemy, he was stoned to death in Jerusalem. According to legend his remains were taken to Rome in the fifth century and buried beside those of St Lawrence.This lunette is divided in two by the monumental city wall which forms a natural part of both the scenes portrayed. The soft hills strewn with collections of towers and houses are in Angelico's familiar landscape style. All lit from the same source, the lunette has a complete spatial unity.On the left St Stephen, having incurred the wrath of the council, is dragged to the city gate and meets his fate outside it as the first Christian martyr. On the right he is portrayed at prayer. Around him are the stones which have bloodied his face; two more bounce off the back of his head; one of his executioners raises another one high, about to strike again, and holds more in his robe. Saul, who was a consenting witness to the execution, is shown, following the details given in the Acts of the Apostles, as a young man holding part of Stephen's clothes which had been laid at his feet by the witnesses

15593-10heaven.jpg	"The compositional scheme of a central figure surrounded by saints is used by Ghirlandaio in a work dating from about 1492: he depicts Christ, with his hand raised in blessing, enthroned on a cloud bank and surrounded by angels. The main lines of the garments, the contours of the figures, and their gazes all lead the eye to Christ, who crowns the composition of the picture. In the bottom right hand corner kneels the donor Fra Giusto Bonvicini, the abbot of a Camaldolese monastery. He is wearing the habit of the order of the so-called ""white Benedictines"", an order of hermits founded by Saint Romuald. Ghirlandaio structured this composition in an unusual manner, for the figures appear to be circling an empty central space. Here, however, we can see one of the most successful landscapes Ghirlandaio ever painted.The bald-headed donor with the striking profile humbly takes his place among the saints worshipping Christ. These are arranged in a rigid symmetry. Two local female saints in shining red are kneeling, seen from behind, in the foreground. The two male saints, similar to the point of confusion, are standing like columns on either side.The altarpiece was painted for the Camaldolite abbot Buonvicini of the Badia di San Giusto, outside Volterra, and now it is in the Civic Picture Gallery of that town"

32813-40tempi.jpg	The sentiment of anxious motherhood, enriched by great awareness, is fully expressed in the Tempi Madonna. The Virgin is holding the Christ Child closely and tenderly. She has eyes only for him, but the Child is looking at the observer, and so draws us into the intimate scene. The rapidly applied colour on the veil, where the paint has been modelled by brush strokes while still wet, shows Raphael using his materials much more freely than in his earlier panel paintings.The two figures are conceived as a single group, and this fact dominates the scene's visual impact. The only natural elements are a small strip of landscape and the light blue sky in the background. The Madonna's swollen mantle is meant to indicate movement. The extreme synthesis of the colour fields indicates Raphael's idealization of the subject. But the painter's need for formal beauty and the emotional reality of the subject matter are reconciled above all through the tender relationship between Mother and Child.This panel, which critics place in the year 1508, is included among the works executed after Raphael's contact with Florentine art

This fresco reveals that he was no longer concerned with including as many figures as could possibly fit in such a scene. Instead, Salviati concentrated on fewer forms - Elizabeth and Zachariah, as well as the dove-bearing maid at the left and the women bathing the child at the right - and even dispensed with the important subject of Zachariah naming John, a subject that he had still included in his early drawing. In the figure of the newborn child, Salviati quotes Michelangelo's Jonah

44696-bacchana.jpg	The Tuscan painter Francesco Zuccarelli came to Venice in 1732. He was familiar with trends in European painting, having visited London and Paris. His ideal pastoral landscapes are characterized by an arcadian grace in the use of colour, by a harmonious rhythm of gesture, a softness of tone and a hazy atmosphere filling the spacious vistas. In the idyllic countryside, pastoral or mythological scenes are set against a brilliant green or water-side background. The paintings are sentimental, sometimes achieving a refined lyricism in keeping with the light-hearted ideals of the time.

33539-50portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 179.A possible suggestion for the subject of this painting is King Uzziah. The story, 'Uzziah stricken with leprosy', is related in 2 Chronicles, Chapter XXVI, vv. 18-19, and also told in greater detail by Flavius Josephus in his Jewish Antiquities, Book IX, paragraph 222. King Uzziah of Judah, who brought great prosperity to his realm, became so puffed up with pride that he entered the temple of Jerusalem and tried to burn incense at the altar, which only priests were permitted to do. As a punishment for his presumption he was struck down with leprosy. In Rembrandt's painting, the face of the man is tense with rage or fear, which would be suitable for Uzziah or some other Old Testament figure. Moreover, the face is blotched with greyish-white flecks, which are not due to discolouration of the paint, and can hardly be anything other than the marks of leprosy

Only the principal painting, The Triumph of St Hermengild, remains, but it is a brilliant work of art.

42593-17lute.jpg	Signature: Indistinct remainders of a signature(?) on the wall below the tablecloth.Provenance: Sale Amsterdam, 1817, with the attribution to Vermeer van Delft, for fl 65; collection Collis B. Huntington, New York (bought in England). Bequeathed to the museum in 1897.We have here a much skinned and damaged painting, to the point where it is possible that we are in the presence of a copy only. Very little in this work seems to indicate Vermeer's original technique, brush stroke, and savoir faire. The composition seems to belong to Vermeer. The left part (from the viewer's perspective) of the lady's figure is bathed in strong light, whereas the rest falls abruptly into penumbra, in concordance with the chiaroscuro pattern derived from the master of Leyden by many of his disciples, such as Leonard Bramer. On the back wall, a large map on which the word EUROPA can be made out. According to Blankert, this map was first published by J. Hondius in 1613 and republished by J. Blaeu in 1659. The artist obviously made use in this work of an optical instrument such as the inverted Galilean telescope, to obtain the emphasized foreground, set against the recession of the lute player into space.

42175-founding.jpg	This fresco is located on the east wall of the Pellegrinaio in the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala. The Pellegrinaio is a fourteenth-century room took the form of a long vaulted hall situated on the ground floor of the hospital.Vecchietta was entrusted with painting the first in the series of paintings on the east wall that illustrated scenes in the Spedale's history. This was the Vision of St Sorore (The Founding of the Spedale di Santa Maria della Scala).In this painting Vecchietta set the complex scene in what appears to be a vaulted church. This allowed him to place the central narrative event within the nave of this church. Here the cobbler, Sorore, the mythical founder of the Spedale, is shown describing to one of the canons of the cathedral the vision that his mother was alleged to have experienced before his birth. Behind these two figures, in the space of the domed crossing, appears the vision itself - the Virgin welcoming infants who have reached heaven by climbing up the hospital's emblem of a ladder. The right-hand aisle of the church, meanwhile, acts as the setting for the first occasion when Sorore brought a foundling to one of the cathedral canons and received money for the upkeep of the child. The entire edifice is fronted by an impressive fa�ade whose style with its antique detail of fluted piers, ornate capitals and frieze is unequivocally Renaissance. Perspective has been employed to great effect, both on the pavement of the church and in the recession of the building itself.The complete description of the frescoes in the Pellegrinaio can be found in the section of Domenico di Bartolo, who executed six of the surviving eight frescoes of the hall

37328-3orsini.jpg	"The altarpiece known as Passion Polyptych (or Orsini Polyptych), with panels now in a number of European museums (Angel of the Annunciation and Virgin of Annunciation, as well as Crucifixion and Deposition in Antwerp, the Road to Calvary in Paris and the Entombment in Berlin) is signed ""Pinxit Symon"" on the two panels of the Crucifixion and the Deposition. It presents several problems, both in terms of stylistic analysis and dating.Some scholars, stressing the fact that it is so different stylistically from all the other works of Simone's Avignon period (nervous lines and expressions), think that it may have been painted earlier and then transported to France; others believe that it may be a late work, commissioned by Napoleone Orsini, who died in the Curia in Avignon in 1342. Orsini's coat-of-arms appears in the background of the Road to Calvary. The polyptych was probably transferred to the charterhouse of Champmol, near Dijon, in the late 14th century."

03329-godfathe.jpg	Following his trip to Venice, Fra Bartolomeo produced the God the Father with Sts Catherine of Siena and Mary Magdalen in which critics have observed that the colour and especially the light have points in common with the art of Giovanni Bellini. The figures are restrained in their gestures but fully evolved physically, as are the fine nude children who encircle the blessing Father. The women down below are arranged to provide a central void articulated by a low-lying landscape. They float above the ground, but their solidity is unchallenged.Here, too, is a trompe l'oeil element, this time a book close to the bottom of the picture; on it rests Catherine's attribute, lilies. The two saints are perfectly balanced yet sufficiently differentiated to offer diversity without discord. God the Father is stark, awesome, blatant, rhetorical.The formal structure of this altarpiece is rather simple. The number of figures is held to a minimum both in the zone of the two unaccompanied saints and in that of God the Father, whose heavenly company is limited to a few puttis. The low horizon silhouettes the figures of the saints almost entirely against the pale sky

00779-3predel2.jpg	In the predella below the Annunciation, near the two farthest edges, two scenes are painted (23 x 14 cm each). The first represent the Birth of the Virgin, the other The Virgin Consigns the Habit to St Dominic. There are five central scenes of the life of the Virgin, one after the other without interruption (23 x 183 cm), namely (from the left). Marriage of the Virgin, The Visitation, Adoration of the Magi, Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Death of the Virgin.This picture shows the scene of the Visitation. The event shown here is described in the Gospel of Luke. Immediately following the Annunciation, Mary 'went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth' (Luke 1, v. 39-40). The Virgin and Elisabeth embrace, the straight folds of their gowns showing a simplicity and reserve alien to the curvilinear trecento influences of some ofAngelico's mentors and contemporaries. Elisabeth, six months pregnant with John the Baptist, is given a wider girth than her cousin. Juda is represented by a series of simple, geometric forms, sharply lit but slightly thin and awkward. A woman makes her way up the hill path which lies in shadow below her. Behind her the sky and earth meet in the haze of a Tuscan summer.This is the first identifiable landscape in Italian art. In the middle distance a lake, which no longer exists, spreads out in the Chiana Valley; beyond rises the town of Castigliona Florentino, and further distant the tower of Monterchi

12473-02father.jpg	D�rer's earliest surviving oil painting, done just after he finished his apprenticeship, is a portrait of his father, the goldsmith Albrecht the Elder (1427-1502). Dated 1490, it was painted early in the year, before D�rer left Nuremberg on his journeyman travels in April. Albrecht the Elder, then probably aged 62 (or 63 if he was born at the beginning of 1427), is depicted from the waist up, wearing a black hat and brown. cape lined with black fur. He holds a rosary. D�rer later wrote that his father `lived an honourable, Christian life, was a man patient of spirit, mild and peaceable to all, and very thankful towards God'.On the reverse of this portrait are the coats of arms of Albrecht the Elder and those of his wife Barbara Holper. The family name `D�rer' originated from the name of the birthplace of Albrecht the Elder's father, since the village of Ajt� where he came from means `door' in Hungarian and this was translated into German as `T�re' or `D�re'. The D�rer coat of arms therefore bears an emblematic, open double-door. The portrait of Albrecht the Elder may well have been the right wing of a diptych, with the other panel portraying his wife. A portrait believed to be of Barbara Holper, still in Nuremberg and attributed to D�rer, could well be the other half of the diptych, although it may be an early copy of a lost original

27012-luteplay.jpg	Parrasio Micheli (or Michieli) was Titian's pupil who later followed the style of Paolo Veronese. This work of him is an outstanding manifestation of contemporary thinking concerning the close connection between music and love.The ecstatic-looking young woman in the picture accompanies herself on the lute. Her identity as the goddess of love is obvious. Her clothes revealing her breasts and shoulder refer to sensuality, the pearls around her neck and wrists and in her ears remind the observer that she, too, was born of the sea, and finally, her child, the blonde Cupid holds the opened sheet music for her and garlands her arm with a laurel wreath.Venus's instrument is a well-formed lute with a beautiful rosette but with only seven strings, instead of the eleven to thirteen strings which were usual in the sixteenth century. The painter accurately observed the playful hand position of the lutenists.Elegance, charm and genteel eroticism characterize this late Renaissance piece of Venetian art. Its contemporary success is proven by the fact that several copies and variants of it exist.

The blooms - including two variegated tulips, narcissus, columbine, lily-of-the-valley, a carnation and a rose - are strewn on the ledge with the carnation and one of the tulips seeming to burst out of the picture plane.

18332-1306grec.jpg	This painting was made for the Capilla de San Jos� (Chapel of Saint Joseph) in Toledo, originally it was placed on the right-hand side of the high altar. The paintings for the high altar (still in place) were the Saint Joseph and the Christ Child, and above, the Coronation of the Virgin; and, for the side altars, the Saint Martin and the Beggar and the Virgin and Child with Saints were placed.Originally located on the side altar opposite Saint Martin and the Beggar, this painting shows the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus enthroned in the heavens, surrounded by angels and seraphim. The postures of the Virgin and Child are similar to those in The Holy family with Saint Mary Magdalen in Cleveland. Below two virgin martyrs are shown in adoration of the heavenly group: St Martina with the Lion and St Agnes with the lamb. Although the first is traditionally identified as St Martina (her inclusion could be a reference to the name of the founder, Mart�n Ram�rez), there are several reasons for suggesting that El Greco actually represented St Thecla who features in the legend of St Martin, who received frequent visits in his room from the Virgin Mary accompanied by Sts Agnes and Thecla. (The lion and palm branch are the standard attributes of both St Martina and St Thecla.

38657-dancing.jpg	This is one of an outstanding group of interior scenes with figures painted by ter Borch in Deventer in the years around 1660. He paints young men and women in elegant rooms, talking, dancing, drinking, making music and flirting. In addition to his skill in setting the scene, ter Borch possesses a remarkable technical gift, especially in the description of texture. No Dutch artist rendered satin more effectively than ter Borch nor was able to differentiate better in the medium of oil paint between the textures of a leather jerkin, a gleaming breastplate, a table carpet, a wooden lute and a brass candelabra.In 1658 ter Borch was in Delft where he witnessed a document with the young Vermeer. This recently discovered evidence of a direct contact between the two artists confirms what has long been suggested: that the simplicity and restraint of ter Borch's style exercised an important influence on the Delft painter.

34184-bartholo.jpg	This painting was traditionally considered to represent the martyrdom of St Bartholomew, who was crucified and flayed while alive. Based on the fact that the attribute of the saint, the knife is lacking  in the picture, recent research established that the painting represents the martyrdom of St Philip who was one of the first disciples to follow Jesus. He preached the Gospel in Phrygia and died at Hierapolis, first stoned that crucified.St Philip apostle was Philip IV's patron saint and presumably Ribera painted the canvas upon royal commission. Like Caravaggio in his Crucifixion of St Peter, Ribera contradicts the canonical concept of the heroic martyr who bears his torture with quiet patience and the serene assurance of salvation. Philip, apostle and preacher is portrayed by Ribera as a weak elderly man, whose fear of death and desperation are clearly written in his face. The louts dragging him up by a beam before the eyes of the curious onlookers are concentrating fully on their task. The question of guilt and innocence remains unanswered for the incident is still very much in the present

38261-lawrence.jpg	After moving to Venice, Strozzi was also successful in his later career when he produced large-scale paintings and altarpieces. This filled a gap that had opened in the local school. Strozzi's early fleshy and thick style was still present in his Venetian canvases with their clear references to Rubens. By this time, however, the opportunity of seeing the work of Titian and other great sixteenth-century Venetian masters had made Strozzi's work more spectacular.This painting is a later version of the subject that was repeated many times by the artist. Strozzi tackles an audacious lowered perspective, finding a satisfying point of equilibrium in the chromatic contrast of the beggars' coarse nakedness, indicative of their poverty, and the Dalmatian red of the young dean. The latter's grace and gentleness are the counterpoint to the supplicants' gesticulation

35566-14mariem.jpg	Marie de M�dicis (1573-1642), queen consort of King Henry IV of France (reigned 1589-1610) and, from 1610 to 1614, regent for her son, King Louis XIII (reigned 1610-43).Marie was the daughter of Francesco de' Medici, grand duke of Tuscany, and Joanna of Austria. Shortly after Henry IV divorced his wife, Margaret, he married Marie (October 1600) in order to obtain a large dowry that would help him pay his debts. In 1601 Marie gave birth to the dauphin Louis (the future Louis XIII), and during the following eight years she bore the king five more children. Nevertheless, their relationship was strained. Marie resented Henry's endless infidelities, and the king despised her unscrupulous Florentine favourites, Concino Concini and his wife Leonora. Upon the assassination of Henry IV (May 14, 1610) the Parlement of Paris proclaimed Marie regent for young King Louis XIII.Guided by Concino (now the Marquis d'Ancre), Marie reversed Henry's anti-Spanish policy. She squandered the state's revenues and made humiliating concessions to the rebellious nobles. Although Louis XIII came of age to rule in September 1614, Marie and Ancre ignored him and continued to govern in his name. On April 24, 1617, Louis's favourite, Charles d'Albert de Luynes, had Ancre assassinated. Marie was then exiled to Blois, but in February 1619 she escaped and raised a revolt. Her principal adviser, the future Cardinal de Richelieu, negotiated the peace by which she was allowed to set up her court at Angers. Richelieu again won favourable terms for her after the defeat of her second rebellion (August 1620). Readmitted to the king's council in 1622, Marie obtained a cardinal's hat for Richelieu, and in August 1624 she persuaded Louis to make him chief minister. Richelieu, however, did not intend to be dominated by Marie. He enraged her by rejecting the Franco-Spanish alliance and allying France with Protestant powers. By 1628 Marie was the cardinal's worst enemy. In the crisis known as the Day of the Dupes (Nov. 10, 1630), she demanded that Louis dismiss the minister. Louis stood by Richelieu and in February 1631 banished Marie to Compi�gne. She fled to Brussels in the Spanish Netherlands in July 1631 and never returned to France. Eleven years later she died destitute.Marie de M�dicis built the Luxembourg Palace in Paris, and in 1622-24 Peter Paul Rubens decorated its galleries with 21 paintings, portraying the events of her life, that rank among his finest work.

19906-04cleves.jpg	In 1539, Holbein was sent to D�ren, in the Duchy of Cleves, to paint a portrait of Anne as a possible candidate for marriage. Despite its bland, unprepossessing appearance, this royal commission is coloured by a controversial history. Holbein was placed in an impossible position: despatched to D�ren with orders to produce an instant likeness of Henry VIII's next intended bride, he needed to exercise diplomacy and tact - he would have had to show the results of his rapid sittings to the foreign officials. As it is, Anne's dress seems to have fascinated him more than the strangely lifeless symmetry of her features.As the Paris portrait is painted on parchment and not on a difficult-to-transport wooden panel, it could have been painted on the spot, or at least well prepared by Holbein. The point of the picture was to give Henry as close an idea of the woman's appearance as possible. This would explain the frontal position, in which every detail of the face can be examined.Henry's displeasure at finding Anne of Cleves more like a `fat flanders mare' when she arrived for the marriage ceremony in January 1540 cost Holbein dear in prestige, and he received no further important work from this quarter.Belying her appearance, Anne of Cleves, like Christina of Denmark, was no fool. Despite - or because of - the evident humiliation of the failed marriage she obtained a handsome settlement from Henry and lived in quiet comfort in England until 1555. Henry's two subsequent wives were English

As in Rembrandt's mature phase, which is approximately contemporaneous, this landscape shows classical elements which strengthen the compositional power. Horizontals and verticals are coordinated with the Baroque diagonals, which are still alive and help to create a mighty spaciousness. The atmospheric quality is as important as ever in uniting the whole impression. Light breaks now with greater intensity through the clouds and the clouds themselves gain in substance and volume.

15554-3birth.jpg	"The Birth of St John the Baptist and the Zacharias Writes Down the Name of his Son can be found on the second level of the right wall.The scene is described by Vasari. ""... the birth of St John, with a beautiful idea that, while Elisabeth is in bed and being visited by her neighbours and a nurse is suckling the child, a woman is eagerly calling the attention of the visitors to the wonder that has come to her mistress in her old age; and lastly there is a woman bringing fruit and wine from the city, in conformity with the Florentine custom. This is very fine"".In the Birth of Saint John the Baptist Ghirlandaio once again created a room flooded with light and air. We can well imagine that the palace rooms of Ghirlandaio's patrons being similar to this. In this picture he makes use of contrasting complementary colours by placing the red bedspread in front of the green wall hanging. In front of the wall hanging, a maid dressed in red and green is carrying a tray with carafes of water and wine for the refreshment of the woman in childbed. The golden orange hues of the pilasters and entablatures form a complementary contrast with the light blue of aged Elizabeth and the young maid coming in from at the far right. Such colour schemes help to create the captivating clarity that characterizes so much of Ghirlandaio's work.It is not just the age of Elizabeth and her maid that contrast, but also their respective auras of stillness and movement. Nowadays it is astonishing to think that Savonarola, the severe preacher of repentance, could have taken exception to this superb maid. She corresponds to the nurse on the far left, who is stretching out her arms eagerly. The two figures form an exciting frame for the quiet scene taking place in-between.In the Birth of John the Baptist, Elizabeth is visited by female representatives of the donor family - as is Anne in the birth scene on the opposite wall. The only figure that can be identified is that of the poet Lucrezia Tornabuoni, who was known for being very virtuous. She was the mother of Lorenzo de' Medici and a friend of the humanist Agnolo Poliziano and Luigi Pulci, portrayed in the Sassetti Chapel together with her son.There is actually nothing in this scene to suggest that it is depicting an event from the story of St John - with the sole exception of the severely weather-beaten halo surrounding Elizabeth's head. In this scene from everyday life, Ghirlandaio surpassed even his beautiful Birth of Mary. In addition to the marvelous basket of fruit, he added another two still-lifes to the picture in order to make it appear more home-like and realistic. On the far left two objects, a brass jug and bowl, that we are already familiar with from the fresco the Last Supper in the church of Ognissanti, and from the frescoes in the Santa Fina Chapel. At the top of the bed's headboard, next to the window, there is a symmetrical arrangement of a box, two pomegranates and a vase, reminiscent of both Saint Jerome's study and the frescoes in the Saint Fina Chapel. All these things once again bring Flemish painting to mind, which during this period made widespread use of everyday secular details as accessories. The miniature depicting the birth of Saint John the Baptist in the Turin/Milan Book of Hours is an outstanding example - a superb work that was most probably painted by Jan van Eyck himself, though its attribution is just as disputed as its date"

42285-0703vela.jpg	Vel�zquez painted the likenesses of some of the dwarfs of the Spanish court who were, in the words of Carl Justi, 'loved and treated as dogs'. These unfortunate cripples, sometimes weak-minded but sometimes wise, often attached themselves to the courts in the Middle Ages and later; there they found shelter in return for their services as court jesters, and they had to endure the rude remarks and practical jokes of the courtiers. Their feelings as human beings were generally ignored, but the portrait of the dwarf Sebasti�n de Morra (it was a form of mockery to give the dwarfs such grandiose names) is one of the most penetrating character studies ever made by the master.Although the dwarf Don Sebasti�n de Morra is portrayed in full figure, he is not standing in a self-confident pose or elegantly seated on a chair, but is sitting on the bare earth with his feet stretched out in front of him. This low position not only shows up the sumptuous clothing for the clownish apparel it is, but also heightens the intended effect: the court fool is at the mercy of the spectator. Such pictorial devices reveal the voyeurism with which the royal rulers made these people the objects of their shameless whimsy, caprice and power. At the same time, however, the artist is also making another statement: this court fool is giving nothing away, neither a smile, nor any buffoonery. Immobile, scrutinizing and impenetrable, his dark eyes are fixed on the spectator, who somehow feels caught out by such a gaze and turns away.Vel�zquez's greatest achievement as a portrait painter was certainly his highly pictorial portrait of Pope Innocent X, executed during his second visit to Rome; but already in this picture of the dwarf, especially in the expression of the eyes, there is evidence of the great gifts with which this artist was endowed

20069-07concer.jpg	This representation of a concert of music by the Flemish artist who was known in Italy as Gherardo delle Notti, has a moralizing message. Music, in fact, is a high and virtuous art, but also a fleeting one, leading to its association with vanity, symbolized by the old woman who, indicating her now toothless mouth, admonishes the young couple, singing to the accompaniment of a bass viol. There are further nuances to the significance of the image, if the work is to be identified with the painting entitled The Theft of the Amulet, owned by the painter's family and then sold by auction in Amsterdam in 1770 before entering the Borghese collection. In this case the subject should be recognized as a deception of the young man who, intent on his singing, does not realize that the girl is stealing his earring with the complicity of the old woman, ready to slip it into her bag, and of the musician in the foreground.

29616-virgin_c.jpg	In the second half of the fourteenth century there are many instances of well-established Sienese master-painters collaborating on single commissions. It may be that the development was precipitated by the fact that there was not much work to go round and it had to be shared among different painters. But it seems more likely that the reverse was the case and that too much was being demanded of fewer specialist craftworkers. This large altarpiece signed on its lower edge by both Niccol&#242; di Ser Sozzo and Luca di Tomm� in 1362 provides a striking example of such collaboration. Now divested of its original piers, pinnacle panels and predella, the altarpiece was painted probably for the high altar of San Tommaso, a church under the care of the religious order known as the Humiliati. Accordingly, the apostle Thomas is portrayed on the Virgin's right-hand side, a position conventionally understood as that of greatest honour. To his right appears Saint John the Baptist, while Saints Benedict and Stephen appear to the left of the Virgin. The general consensus among art historians is that Niccol&#242; di Ser Sozzo painted the Virgin and Christ Child, Saint Benedict and Saint Stephen while Luca di Tomm� painted Saints John the Baptist and Thomas

07235-canal604.jpg	This is one of a series of five impressive paintings of Roman subjects that Canaletto executed for Joseph Smith. It is not entirely clear whether they were based on a new visit to Rome, or sketches the artist had made there in 1720. It is possible that he could additionally have been inspired by prints of Roman subjects in Smith's collection.The arch was built by the Emperor Constantine in the fourth century, to commemorate his victory over Maxentius. The view is playfully manipulated; the friezes and inscriptions he chose to depict are those which can be seen on the north side, but it is painted as though looked at from the south. Through it can be seen the church of San Pietro in Vincoli, and to the right the edge of the Colosseum. The main group of figures in the foreground, one of whom points with his stick, are probably Grand Tourists who have come to admire the ancient glories of the city.The seated figure at the left, who has beside him a portfolio and ruler and is either writing or drawing, may well be intended as a self-portrait. This is particularly suggested by the figure's proximity to Canaletto's rather grand inscription asserting his authorship and the date of the painting, in a manner that replicates the carvings on the arch

Although Melozzo never completed the commission, which involved wall paintings as well, it is his only cycle that survives in its original spot unaltered.Melozzo has painted each face of the dome with ornamental paneling composed of his favourite elements - guilloches, acanthus, bead-and-reel, palmettes, and dolphins - converging on a central garland of Della Rovere oak leaves that embraces the cardinal's coat-of-arms.

29390-riccardi.jpg	After purchasing in 1659 the Palazzo Medici from Ferdinando II de' Medici by Gabriello Riccardi, a number of architects contributed to the remodeling of the palace which took thirty years. The most spectacular intervention into the original fabric was the construction, beginning in 1670, an east-west gallery wing. In 1676 the library was built directly beside the gallery. In 1684-89 another new wing was built to the north.Anton Domenico Gabbiani painted three ceilings in the new rooms, the Allegory of the Fine Arts under the Protection of Wisdom and Nature; the Fall of Icarus; and the Triumph over Error. The painted decoration of two additional rooms complete the pictorial program of Gabbiani's ceilings. The quadratura-framed ceilings of these rooms, depicting Hercules at the Crossroads, and Jupiter Subdues the Giants, were painted by Giuseppe Nicola Nasini and his cousin Tommaso Nasini.

00852-38_cruci.jpg	This is the fresco on the wall of Cell 38 of the Convento di San Marco in Florence.One cell at the end of the corridor for lay brothers was distinguished by its occupant and size. It was intended for Cosimo de' Medici, who belonged to the community by virtue of his patronage. His room, in fact, was a double cell (Cells 38 and 39), in which the superimposed chambers were joined by a short flight of stairs. Of all the cells along this corridor, Cosimo's was the most spacious and elaborately decorated. On the entrance wall of the lower room (Cell 38) Fra Angelico painted the crucified Christ against a ground of costly lapis lazuli, rather than the bare plaster background found in the other cells. The inscribed haloes identify the saints kneeling alongside the Virgin as Cosmas, Peter martyr and John the Evangelist, protectors of Cosimo, his oldest son, and his father, Giovanni di Bicci.The Adoration of the Magi and the image of Christ as Man of Sorrows in the recessed tabernacle below met Cosimo's gaze once he ascended the stairs to Cell 39. Benozzo Gozzoli, whose style closely resembled that of Angelico, and an assistant painted these frescoes, as shown by the slightly awkward stance and proportions of some of the figures as well as by their linear, closely spaced facial features

30692-paolina2.jpg	"Between 1542 and 1548 Pope Paul III transformed a series of rooms on the two upper levels of the Castel Sant'Angelo into a comfortable and at the same time impressive apartment. Time and again this castle had provided protection to popes against the incursions of secular powers, and it continued to have a military function. His predecessors had commissioned various decorations, although these have been lost. The newly decorated rooms were to provide leisure and spiritual rest - the typical purpose of a country house or villa. The mythological subjects with which some of the rooms were painted thus correspond to what one would expect in a villa, but hardly in papal apartments.The largest room of these apartments, the great hall today called the Sala Paolina after the pope who commissioned it, surprises the visitor with its festive exuberance. Most important is the impression of the whole which presents itself to the eye and aims to overpower visitors to the room with the sheer display of riches, splendour, and bounty. This impression is the  result of the decorative system designed by Perino del Vaga.The seemingly plastic organization of the walls features bronze chiaroscuri framed in stone; round-headed niches flanked by columns, with ""living"" figures of the Virtues; overdoor paintings with female personifications; and pairs of putti holding bronze tondi. The plastic organization of the walls enters into competition with the fully plastic, partially gilded stucco of the ceiling and its colourful paintings.The six ceiling paintings and the large wall areas were reserved for scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, while the act of Apostle Paul - from his conversion to martyrdom - were depicted in the six tondi above the doors of the room. The selection of these two protagonists was clearly intended to play on the two names of the pope (Alessandro Farnese having become Paul III).Perino del Vaga painted just a part of the frescoes, the other parts being done by collaborators following his cartoons. Marco Pino from Siena, a student of Beccafumi, painted the six Alexander scenes on the vault"

44332-resurrec.jpg	Hans Pleydenwurff died at the height of his career in 1472. Michael Wolgemut, his gifted assistant, married his widow and inherited Pleydenwurff's workshop. One of the last commissions that Pleydenwurff contracted was the so-called Hofer Altarpiece for the church of the Holy Trinity in Hof, which featured painted wings with the Life of Christ for a sculptured central shrine. It is generally assumed that Wolgemut and his shop were responsible for the paintings after the death of Pleydenwurff. The panel depicting the Resurrection has been attributed to Wolgemut's hand, and while the attribution is not certain, the style of this colourful panel represents the fine fusion of Flemish and Germanic that characterizes the heritage of Pleydenwurff. The composition is based on panels by Dieric Bouts, such as that on the right wing of altarpiece in Granada and the Resurrection in Pasadena.

24269-annunci.jpg	"""The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary...."" These words echo the beginning of one of the biblical narratives of Jesus' conception and birth. The story of the archangel Gabriel announcing to Mary that she, though a virgin, was to give birth to the Messiah depicts in a few verses the reality and the functions of angels.The angel was sent by God to this world to make the announcement. Since God's realm was thought of as ""above"" our world, angels are often visually represented with wings, much the way Jupiter's messenger, Mercury, had wings on his sandals, hat, and wand. How else but by flying could God's messengers get from heaven to earth and back?Angels in the Christian tradition are not gods like the pagan Mercury, but are special messengers of the one God. They are creatures whose being is above that of humans but not equal to that of God. Mary trusts the angel and responds to God's message because she recognizes Gabriel as a superior being used by God to make his message credible. Hence she responds, ""I am the handmaid of the Lord. Let what you have said be done to me."

32909-1borgo.jpg	"The Fire in the Borgo is the most complex of the four episodes in the Stanza dell'Incendio di Borgo. It is full of references to classical antiquity, to medieval architecture at the time of the affirmation of the Church, and to themes used by contemporary artists. It celebrates the intercession of Leo IV, by whose grace a fire which spread through the Borgo, a popular section of Rome near the Basilica of St Peter, was extinguished. The event depicted happened in AD 847 and is documented in the ""Liber Pontificalis"" (a collection of early papal biographies). Pope Leo IV managed miraculously to halt the raging fire, which was threatening an area of the city, by his benediction from the loggia of Old St Peter's.The structure of the composition is complex: two colonnades of clear classical derivation define a square. The Pope, who again bears the features of Leo X, blesses the frightened crowd from a gallery located beyond the colonnades. The fa�ade of old St Peter's appears behind him, in the background. While those in the foreground are desperately trying to put out the fire, the female figure in yellow with her back to us is begging them to look at the only effective source of help, the pope.The term `scenographic' can appropriately be applied to this painting. Clearly, Raphael was concentrating on richer, more varied, but less harmonious compositional solutions than those of his previous paintings. The figure groups express great formal beauty, but they lack harmonious relationships and remain pure examples of episodical representation. The group in the left foreground, for example (made up of an old man on the shoulders of a young man, and a child), may be drawn from the episode of the Aeneid in which Aeneas escapes with his father, Anchises and his son, Ascanius. The woman with children in the centre of the fresco and the water carrier at right, whose clothes blow in the wind, represent similar stereotypes. The nude descending from the wall at left recalls the heroic figures of Michelangelo. Notwithstanding these limitations, the scene is highly effective and demonstrates Raphael's skill as an illustrator, although, as the critics maintain, it was executed largely by his pupils"

11006-401david.jpg	This is a case where a comparison will give a good idea of how differently the same subject was handled by Jacques-Louis David and one of his numerous pupils. David started the portrait of Madame R�camier in 1800 which was never finished. (However, incidentally, this portrait helped a contemporary item of furniture to become known under her name.) When the master learned that the lady had also commissioned his pupil G�rard to paint her, he is said to have refused any further service.In David's portrait, noble simplicity, expressed by the simple dress and the Spartan decoration, is also eloquent in the open face. This might well appear more to the modern viewer than G�rard's version, which was judged to be more representative and flattering at the time. And comparisons with portraits of Madame R�camier by other artists suggest that G�rard had achieved a better likeness than David. The Spartan severity of David's composition, the Neoclassical sparseness of the arrangement, the cool handling of the room, the distanced pose, with the lady turning her shoulder to the viewer, were all elements with which Neoclassicism had operated for long enough.G�rard, by contrast, sets the lady in a noble park loggia, where she seems to be inviting to conversation. Her low-cut bodice is seductive, the red curtain flatters the subject and gives the flesh a rosy tint. Where David gave the beautiful woman a rather severe touch around the mouth, G�rard embellishes her features with the hint of a gentle smile, making her look younger. By contrast, David's portrait in the antique manner looks rather forced. Perhaps these were the reasons why his painting was never finished. Madame R�camier gave G�rard's portrait of her to her admirer Prince Augustus of Prussia, a nephew of Frederick II, who had met the French beauty at the salon of Madame de Sta&#235;l. For state reasons a marriage was impossible, but in the painting Madame R�camier was ever present in the palace which Schinkel furnished for the Prince in 1817

07786-01mirac0.jpg	The Confraternity of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista in Venice called upon the most respected Venetian painters of the period, including  Pietro Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Diana to paint nine canvases for the Great Hall of their headquarters showing the Miracles of the Holy Cross, the story of the miracles performed by the fragment of wood from the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. This fragment had been donated to the brotherhood in 1369 by Philip de Mezi�res, Chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and had soon become an object of great veneration and the symbol of the Scuola, one of the most important and wealthy Venetian confraternities.The canvas painted by Perugino has been lost, but the eight surviving paintings executed between 1496 and 1501, contain depictions of some of the most famous parts of Venice. Since the imposing series of pictures (known as 'teleri') are all in the Accademia now it is easy to compare them: we notice immediately the basic difference between the archaic choice of images, sometimes portrayed purely as a sort of inventory, offered by the older artists and the new, lively depictions of the city painted by Carpaccio.The subject of this 'telero' is the healing of a man possessed performed by Francesco Querini, the Patriarch of Grado, through the intercession of the relic of the Holy Cross in his palace at the Rialto. The actual miracle is relegated to a position in the upper left part of the picture and takes place in the wonderfully airy loggia of the palace. This allows attention to be centred on the view of Rialto Bridge and the banks on either side of the Grand Canal. The bridge depicted is the one built in 1458; at its sides can be seen the shops and in the centre the part which could be raised to allow the taller ships to pass. This construction, which was of wood, collapsed on 4th. August, 1524 and was replaced by the present stone bridge which was opened in 1592. On the left bank, amid the ancient structures can be seen the sign of the Storione Hotel, which stood in a side road, while in the background, behind the bridge, the 'loggia' of the Rialto can be made out, a much-used meeting-place for users of the market. On the right bank are visible the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, destroyed by fire in 1505, Ca' da Mosto with its open canal-side entrance which still exists, and the old campanile of the church of Santi Apostoli which was reconstructed in 1672.All the descriptive precision of the physical surroundings does not cause the work to degenerate into the merely documentary, but acts as a lively support to the scene. On the black waters of the Grand Canal and along its banks the intense daily life of the place runs its course while the noble-men and the very elegant 'compagni della Calza' cluster around below the loggia of the Palace of the Patriarch of Grado and the buildings with their round chimney-pots stand out against the pale blue and pink sky. Each manifestation of reality is caught in its truest aspect, its most accurate shade of colour, in this evocation of a relaxed and airy fifteenth century Venice, a representation which is a long way from the 'inventory' style adopted by the other contemporary 'ceremonial' painters

36810-lazarus.jpg	Giulio de' Medici commissioned a Raising of Lazarus from Sebastiano del Piombo to donate to the cathedral of Narbonne, which owned a relic relating to the story. In his Gospel, St John divided the story of the miracle into three parts: Jesus bids the people taker the stone from the tomb, He tells Lazarus to rise, and then He tells him to unbind his shroud. Sebastiano shows the third of these commands.Sebastiano's rivalry with Raphael is well exemplified by this ambitious painting, which is justly regarded as his most demanding effort, one that failed, however, to dislodge Raphael's primacy in Rome. The share that Michelangelo may have played in the conception of the picture is not known. Since Michelangelo was physically outside of Rome during its execution, he was only able to follow Sebastiano's progress by letter.

44098-1magdale.jpg	Parallels can be found in Campin's work for setting sacred scenes in contemporary domestic interiors like the one depicted here. This beautiful figure seated on a cushion reading a devotional book can be identified as Mary Magdalene by the jar at her side, in reference to the ointment with which she anointed Christ's feet (Luke 7:37-8). When the painting was cleaned in 1956 it was discovered that its dark uniform background, applied probably in the nineteenth century, had concealed the body of Saint Joseph holding a rosary, part of a window with a landscape view, and the foot and crimson drapery of another figure, identified as Saint John the Evangelist by reference to a late fifteenth-century drawing of a similar composition showing the Virgin and Child surrounded by saints. The altarpiece from which this picture was cut has been partially reconstructed with the help of that drawing and two other surviving fragments, one of them the head of Saint Joseph and the other the head of a female saint, both now in Lisbon. The whole picture is estimated to have been about one metre high and one and a half or more metres wide.Van der Weyden's mastery of exquisitely painted naturalistic detail is as apparent here in the nailheads of the floor and Joseph's crystal rosary beads as it is in the gold brocade of the Magdalen's underskirt. In later paintings, however, he combined realistic details with the expression of intense pathos or deep piety, in contrast to his ever-impassive older contemporary, Jan van Eyck.The panel depicting Mary Magdalene was sawn out of a large altarpiece. The figure of the saint - very reminiscent of the figure of St Barbara in the Werl Altarpiece (Prado, Madrid), and probably deriving from the same model - is extremely well painted; her delicate face, in its detailed elaboration and expression, is close to that of St Veronica on the right wing of the Crucifixion Triptych (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). But the floor and the cupboard behind Mary Magdalene, much too narrow and papery in effect, are insubstantial and uninspired. This weakness is particularly clear if we compare the jar of ointment held by the saint with the same attribute in other pictures by Rogier.It is unlikely that Rogier was deliberately trying to create abstract effects in his figures, to match a striking effect of reduction in the general structure of their surroundings. Earlier and later works alike show no such simplification. More probably, he delegated the execution of less important parts of the picture to his assistants in both the Crucifixion Triptych and the altarpiece to which the Mary Magdalene once belonged. Many figures in the mutilated altarpiece were obviously by another painter

24436-baptism.jpg	"Compared to the situation before the recent cleaning, this is the fresco that appears to have benefitted the most from the operation: the splendid colour tones have been rediscovered, as well as the lighting and the draughtsmanship, justifying the fact that this fresco has always been considered a work of unparalleled beauty. Vasari wrote: "" ... a nude trembling because of the cold, amongst the other neophytes, executed with such fine relief and gentle manner, that it is highly praised and admired by all artists, ancient and modern.""Behind this nude, there is another neophyte still fully clothed, in a red and green iridescent cloak. The execution of this figure displays such skill and a sure hand, as well as such a novel pictorial technique, that it almost seems to herald the art of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel.The cold, flowing water of the river presses against the legs of the kneeling neophyte; the water that Peter pours from the bowl, with a gesture rather like that of a farmer sowing his seeds, splashes onto the man's head, drenching his hair and dribbling off in rivulets. Again, as it falls into the river, it splashes and forms little bubbles. These realistic details are not fully visible from the ground.In the past several scholars have suggested that Masaccio must have been helped in this fresco by Masolino or Filippino Lippi (e.g. the head of St Peter, the landscape). However, after the restoration there are no doubts that the entire scene is by Masaccio"

04395-montefel.jpg	The first historical references to Berruguette relate to his stay at Urbino. The great condottiere, Federigo di Montefeltro, duke of Urbino, had summoned Joos van Gent to decorate the library and study of his magnificent palace with allegories of the liberal arts and portraits of Biblical and pagan thinkers. Berruguete may have collaborated with him, but there is no doubt that the allegories and many of the more vigorous portraits of the series are by his hand alone (National Gallery, London, and the Louvre). He also painted the solemn portrait of Federigo and his son (Ducal Palace, Urbino), which gives some idea of his mastery of tactile values and of the airy qualities of physical space, perfectly suggested in depth. These paintings were all executed between 1480 and 1481. During his stay at Urbino, Berruguete completed a certain amount of work which has since remained in Italy. Moreover, he also painted the hands of the portrait of Montefeltro in the famous picture by Piero della Francesca in the Brera Gallery, Milan.After a century of debate there is still no consensus on the authorship of this remarkable painting. Recently many experts attributed it to another Spanish (Castilian) painter, referred to as Pietro di Spagna (Pedro of Spain), who in 1477 was living in Urbino and was closely associated with the ducal court.

12569-3carnati.jpg	"In 1630, this panel was mentioned in the inventory of the possessions of the elector of Bavaria; it subsequently went to the episcopal palace of Freising, but it returned definitively to Munich in 1802. The main part of the space of the painting is occupied by the Virgin's head, encircled by a luminous halo against a dark green background.The perfect regularity of her face as seen from the front leads one to think that, like the Self-Portrait with Fur Coat of 1500 of Munich, this has been ""reconstructed"" according to precise laws of proportion. The Madonna's gaze - her eyes reflecting, like her child's, the window beside them - is not turned toward the spectator, but is directed into the distance. Even the child has a fixed gaze and is busy with a pear in his little hands, while the Madonna gracefully holds a stem of a carnation, with fruit and flower, between her fingers.Similar to the Madonna, who, for the rigid, formal composition of the head seems distant, almost rapt in an ideal world, so the child, with his wide-open eyes, who seems detached from his mother and the spectator. The small panel assumes the look of an icon, in which the carnation alludes to the Passion, and the pear that the child closes in his hands recalls - according to Saint Bonaventure - the sweetness of the wise of mouth and heart"

42554-07stree.jpg	"Signature: Signed left below the window: I V MEER.Provenance: This is one of the rare paintings that are correctly attributed to the Delft Vermeer since its earliest documentation. It first appeared in the Amsterdam sale of 1696 under no. 32: ""A view of a house standing in Delft, by the same; fl 72.10."" Later, it was in the estate of Mrs. Croon, widow of G. W. Oosten de Sruyn, 1799. Then it was in the sale Van Oosten de Bruyn, Haarlem, 1800, there bought by H. van Winter for F 1,040. Thence inherited by the Six family; later acquired by H. W. Deterding and presented by him to the Rijksmuseum in 1921.Although the painting represents in truth two houses and was initially described as one house only, there does not seem to be any doubt about the identification. It is a very simple and appealing painting, which conveys to the viewer a typical aspect of Dutch life as one encountered it in the period. The habitation ensconces and protects its dwellers, while the fa�ades show the viewer nothing but the outside of their intimate existence. This essential simplicity is translated by the artist into a representation of a quiet street imbued with dignity.Contemporaries like de Hooch and Jan Steen also painted bricks and mortar, but their treatment is close only in appearance. Vermeer, as usual, elevated his aim into regions of philosophy that surpassed the pedestrian attempts of others by his calm majesty and feeling for shared intimacy, of which he alone was capable. If superficially, Vermeer resembles his Delft colleagues, he easily surpasses them by the depth of his mastery of light and mood. The painting must be chronologically ranged rather early, because he was the initiator of the genre in this particular fashion.An X-ray shows that the artist had initially planned to add a standing girl to the right of the open alleyway, but eliminated her subsequently so as not to disturb the stillness and equilibrium of the composition. There are numerous painted and watercolour copies after this composition"

44090-2duran.jpg	"There are works by Rogier van der Weyden's own hand artistically related to the Miraflores Altarpiece. In the impressive Madonna in Red - also known as the Dur�n Madonna, after a former owner - there is an architectural niche very like the portals of the altarpiece, again with an angel hovering with a crown at the apex. At the same time, it picks up ideas from the great Deposition (Prado, Madrid): a ""living"" figure of the Virgin appears where a statue would normally stand, removed from any realistic or narrative environment. Any additional explanatory motifs - for instance the small painted sculptures present in other works - are absent from the Dur�n Madonna, and the colours are restricted to only a few values. In her red robe, glowing with an unreal light, and framed in a sculptural niche, the Virgin appears withdrawn and majestic, though her loving attention to her son and the rough, childish way he is leafing through the book are very human touches in themselves. The painting may perhaps come chronologically between the Deposition and the Miraflores Altarpiece, for the angel holding the crown appears more meaningful in the Madonna panel, and is placed above Mary's head in line with pictorial tradition"

20788-herodias.jpg	Herod and Herodias sit at a table in a Renaissance interior. Salome presents the severed head of John the Baptist to them on a platter. Herod recoils from the atrocity, but Herodias holds a knife ready to pierce John's tongue in revenge for the saints's denunciation of her sinful behaviour.The panel belonged to an altarpiece devoted to the story of John the Baptist which was painted in 1496 for the Carthusian monastery of Miraflores near Burgos. The original form of the altarpiece has been partially reconstructed. Its central panel was the Baptism of Christ, now in a Madrid collection. Each wing consisted of at lest two panels placed one on top of the other.Although the work of Juan de Flandes is not really Southern Netherlandish in character, we nevertheless detect the clear influence of painters from Ghent and Bruges, especially Hugo van der Goes. He uses painterly techniques to create a strange atmosphere. The bright lighting and accentuation of the green, red and orange sections generate a nervous tension. Placing the main protagonists in the foreground lends the scene an expressive aura and a pronounced monumentality, which is further heightened by the dramatic movement, the sharply delineated forms and the realistic appearance of the figures.

11639-01view.jpg	The picture shows the general view toward the choir of the Cappella dei Santi Fondatori in the Abbey of Santa Maria, Grottaferrata.The Exarchic Monastery of Santa Maria in Grottaferrata, also known as the Greek Abbey of Saint Nilus, was founded in 1004 by a group of monks from Calabria led by St Nilus of Rossano, a charismatic leader and a very important figure of his time. When St Nilus, the monks' spiritual father, died shortly after founding the Abbey, St Bartholomew the Younger, his favourite disciple and cofounder of the monastery, assumed their leadership. Today, Grottaferrata is the last of the many Byzantine-Greek monasteries that dotted Sicily, southern Italy and Rome itself in the Middle Ages. It is also unique in that, having been founded fifty years before the Great Schism that divided Catholics and Orthodox, it remained in communion with the Church of Rome while preserving the Byzantine rite and monastic tradition of its founders.Preceding the modernization in the style of the Roman Baroque, a chapel, connected to the church and consecrated by the abbey's two founders, had been remodeled between 1608 and 1610. The redesign was funded by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese who commissioned Domenichino to decorate the chapel. The commission was completed in 1612.Domenichino was responsible for the design of painted architecture which structures the simple space of the chapel primarily by painterly means. The elegant row of columns between the chapel and the chancel creates a caesura in terms of subject matter. The paintings in the spandrels flanking the choir arch depict the Annunciation. Between the columns one can see into the chancel, the centre of which is topped by a small oval cupola. The four evangelists are depicted in the cupola pendentives, and above them in oval panels appear three early Christian female martyrs (Sts Agnes, Cecilia, and Francesca Romana). In the cupola's centre panel God the Father appears enthroned on clouds and flanked by angels.By contrast to the scenes related to the Salvation, the narrative paintings on the long walls of the main space are devoted to the two founders of the abbey; because of their size and viewing angles they are the chief attractions of the ensemble. The long walls are divided into two stories, each divided by a door into two rectangular spaces of different width. The events from the lives of the two founders are presented in a total of seven scenes. The scenes selected from various sources meant to illustrate the joint activities of the two founding saints. Three scenes are in the chancel, and four on the long walls of the main room.In the painted niches at the attic level stand eight monumental figures wearing Byzantine vestments and identified by Greek inscriptions. They are bare-headed and wear halos. Closest to the chancel are Sts Basil, John Chrysostom, and Gregory of Nazianzus, venerated as hierarchs in Eastern Church. Secondary to them are the doctors of the church Cyril of Alexandria and John of Damascus, as well as the church fathers Athanasius the Great and Gregory of Nyssa. The eighth figure is St Nicolas of Myra

07612-65lazar.jpg	Most of Caravaggio's religious subjects emphasize sadness, suffering and death. In 1609 he dealt with the triumph of life and in doing so created the most visionary picture of his career.Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, was the patron of Giovanni Battista de' Lazzari, to whom Caravaggio was contracted to paint an altarpiece in the church of the Padri Crociferi. The Gospel of St John tells how Lazarus fell sick, died, was buried and then miraculously raised from the dead by Christ.Once again, the scene is set against blank walls that overwhelm the actors, who once more are laid out like figures on a frieze. Some of them, says Susinno, were modelled on members of the community, but at this stage Caravaggio did not have time to base himself wholly on models and relied on his memory - the whole design is based on an engraving after Giulio Romano and his Jesus is a reversed image of the Christ who called Matthew to join him.There is a remarkable contrast between the flexible bodies of the grieving sisters and the near-rigid corpse of their brother. In the gospel Martha reminds Jesus that, as her brother had been dead four days, he would stink, but here nobody detracts from the dignity of the moment by holding his nose. Jesus is the resurrection and the life and in the darkness through him the truth is revealed

24093-2limbo.jpg	The story of Christ's descent into Limbo does not appear in the Bible, but in the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, and also in the Legenda Aurea of Jacobus da Voragine. Limbo is a neutral zone of Hell where the souls of the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets reside. They are not damned, but cannot ascend into heaven until the coming of Christ. Thus, to the left in Mantegna's painting we have the first human couple, Adam and Eve, the two who, through Original Sin begin the story of Christ's Passion.The composition seems crowded, largely because the upper and left-hand edges have been cut. Christ bends towards one of the patriarchs emerging from the depth of Hell and whose cloak, caught by the wind, surrounds him like a halo. He turns his face and hands towards Christ. The emotional tension of the scene culminates in dialogue between these two figures.Mantegna painted several versions of this theme, however, for the most part these works are now available, if at all, only as drawings or engravings

30603-2mira01.jpg	Toward the end of the seventeenth century, Cesare Alessandri, a wealthy Venetian merchant had a wing erected to the side of his villa, to be used as foresteria (guest quarters). Decorations embellish three rooms on the second floor; the paintings in the central hall and in the northwest room are attributed to Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini. The fresco cycles in these two rooms constitute the first private fresco commission given to Pellegrini after his return to Venice from Rome. His stay in Rome had been beneficial to his development, enabling him to incorporate into his own visual repertory the language of Luca Giordano and Baciccio.In the central hall, within faux-stucco frames, are depictions of mythological scenes inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses. The frescoes are located within vertical compartments of various sizes on the walls of the hall, which, because of its elongated shape, seems almost like a gallery. The light is diffused through three large, arched windows. The windowed wall contains the paintings Apollo and Daphne, Sleeping Endymion, Salmacis and the Hermaphrodite, and Cadmus Sowing the Dragons Teeth. The two short walls have the Rape of Deianira and Narcissus at the Spring on one side, and the Rape of Europa and on the other. Mercury and Argus. The entrance wall has the representations Dana&#235; and the Shower of Gold, Venus Weeping over the Death of Adonis, and Pan and Syrinx.Above, a painted frieze of interwoven laurel leaves circle the perimeter of the room. Perched atop the frieze, are child musicians, parrots, squirrels, and little monkeys. The decorative program is completed on the curvature of the ceiling, where eight inserts depict putti and little satyrs at play. On the vault are three coffers in which the frescoes for the most part faded away

24734-presenta.jpg	According to an apocryphal life of Mary, her parents, Anna and Joachim, were not blessed with child for twenty years and when at last their daughter Miriam or Mary was born, they were so grateful to the Lord that they gave her into the care of the church and she became a virgin of the temple. These maidens were educated and received moral instruction from the priests, an arrangement which to some extent foreshadowed the orders of nuns in the Middle Ages. This painting by a Castilian artist - named after the place where his most important works may now be seen - records the moment when Mary takes leave of her parents and presents herself to the high priest. The artist's gift for depicting thoughts and feelings is clearly illustrated in the faces of Joachim and the high priest. His picture The Crucifixion, also in Budapest, suggests that the painter was an expressive artist, with a desire to convey the dramatic aspects of suffering; but this painting shows that he was also capable of lyricism and that even in his representation of saints he sought to express his knowledge of the human heart.

41958-1allegor.jpg	"The Brotherhood of Charity, the Caridad, as it is known, was one of Seville's major lay confraternities. It was founded in 1565 with the mission of providing a decent burial for paupers. From 1663 the charitable activities were expanded to provide care for the needy sick, and a hospital was built, simultaneously enlarging and renovating the already existing chapel.The scheme for the decoration of the chapel is a tripartite exposition of Christian charity as the way of salvation. The first part comprises two memorable paintings by Vald�s Leal, demonstrating the futility of earthly pursuits and honours. A life devoted to accumulating wealth, power, and even learning is shown to lead only to the grave. Charity, which constitutes the second part of the program, provides the way to salvation, as seen in the seven acts of mercy, six of which are depicted by Murillo; the seventh, burying the dead, the Caridad's foundation charity, is embodied in a sculptural group, the Entombment of Christ by Pedro Rold�n, placed in the altarpiece. The third component consists of two paintings by Murillo for lateral altars, depicting St Elizabeth of Hungary and St John of God, both illustrating the efficacy of good works and the necessity of personal participation in charitable deeds.Vald�s Leal's relentlessly gruesome paintings are located just inside the entrance, so that visitors to the church must experience the agony of Vald�s's Hell before entering the promised land of Murillo's acts of mercy. The first, entitled In Ictu Oculi (In the twinkling of an Eye), is a highly charged representation of the futility of worldly goals and pursuits. The path of glory lead but to the grave, which is unflinchingly rendered in the companion picture, Finis Gloriae Mundi (The End of Worldly Glory), where vile bugs feast on the rotting remnants of human flesh.Of all the great painters of the school of Seville - alongside Zurbar�n, Vel�zquez and Murillo - the distinctive style of Vald�s Leal is the most difficult to place. Only these two major allegories on the transience of life and on death which he himself is said to have described as ""hieroglyphs of our afterlife"" have remained truly popular. His patron, Don Miguel de Ma&#241;ara, was a Knight of the Order of Calatrava who became a benefactor of the brotherhood of the hospital and its church in penitence for his previous life of decadence. The epitaph on his grave succinctly describes the spirit that commissioned such a powerful vanitas still life: ""Here lie the bones and ashes of the worst person who ever lived on earth"". His last will and testament contains the most humble self accusation not only as a great sinner, but also as an adulterer, robber and servant of the devil.The In Ictu Oculi (an allegory of death) presents the triumph of the grim reaper, who sweeps into the picture as an imposing figure. One skeletal foot stands on the globe, while the other stands on armaments, the trappings of office and insignia of power. Under his arm, he carries a coffin and in his hand a scythe. As his right hand snuffs out the life-light represented by the candle, he stares at the spectator from the very depths of his empty eye-sockets"

06232-porgreen.jpg	William Hazlitt, writing in 1823, described the colours of the costume worn by the sitter in this memorable portrait as resembling 'the leaves and flower of the water-lily, and so clear'. The drawing and modelling are equally assured in the firm delineation of the features and the gentle modulation of light. The tilt of the head and the angle of the shoulders provide a distinctive characterisation for this unknown figure. Similar attention has been given to the costume with its slashed sleeves, puff shoulders, embroidered chemise and elegant headgear. The artist has combined the simplicity of form, attention to detail and high degree of finish often associated with his work. However, it lacks the abstract qualities of Bronzino's mature portraits which transcend a feeling of reality in favour of the metaphysical.An attribution to Bronzino has not been universally accepted and some scholars have favoured an artist from north Italy, specifically from Emilia or Lombardy. The mitigating factor in such an argument lies in the costume which is not Central Italian in style. If the portrait is by Bronzino, then it must be early in date, between the Portrait of a Lady with a Lap-dog (Frankfurt, St&#228;delsches Kunstinstitut) or the Portrait of a Boy with a Book, dating from the early 1530s (Milan, Castello Sforzesca, Trivulzio collection), and the Portrait of a Young Man with a Lute (Florence, Uffizi) or the Portrait of Ugolino Martelli, dating from the mid-1530s (Berlin, Staatliche Museen). It was at the beginning of this decade that Bronzino worked in Pesaro for the court of Urbino (1530-2) and it is possible that he took the opportunity to travel in Emilia, to places like Bologna, Ferrara or Modena. Alternatively, north Italian fashions could have been seen in the Marches, either at Urbino itself or in Pesaro, owing to the strong dynastic connections between Italian courts

32366-xavier.jpg	"This painting was conceived as an altarpiece for the Church of Our Lady (""Matthias Church"") in Budapest. It is now  on permanent loan from the History Museum, Budapest.After the liberation of Hungary from the Turkish occupation, the church of Our Lady in Buda Castle passed into the ownership of the Society of Jesus. Their annals referred as early as 1701 to a ""new and elegant"" altarpiece of St. Francis Xavier, while a minute record from 1710 also describes the subject of the picture and its great artistic value. In this latter notice it is also mentioned that the altarpiece was painted by the greatly loved member of the order, the highly gifted Andrea Pozzo. The note about this brilliant and versatile Baroque artist (he was a painter, drawer, aquarellist, architectural designer, as well as an art theoretician), written in the year following his death, should be taken as fully authentic. It is inspired by the pleasure the Jesuits of Buda felt with the possession of at least one work of art from his splendid oeuvre.The picture represents one of the most glorious successes of St. Francis Xavier as a Jesuit missionary in India: the very moment of his baptizing Queen Neachile of India, an eminent member of the royal family, giving her the name Isabella. Until then the Queen, a devout adherent of the  ancient Indian religion, had been a most stubborn enemy of the Cristian faith, so her conversion was regarded as a singular achievement of Cristian missionary work in the Far East.In Pozzo's oeuvre there are also some other variations on the same theme. In the Buda altarpiece the main figures of the scene are brought into relief by a monumental shaping; the modelling of light and shadow lays emphasis on the moment of administering the sacrament. The balance of the composition is given by a kneeling boy who holds a baptismal bowl in his hands - a figure entirely absent in the other variations"

26007-06gijoye.jpg	Only the pale pink face of the man, who is dressed in a reddish-brown tabard with a grey fur collar, stands out from the uniform, blue-green ground. All that we see of his hands, clasped in prayer in the left corner, are the long, calligraphically painted fingers. He wears two rings on his ring finger - one with a blue stone and another with his coat-of-arms. The latter appears again on the left of the original, brown and black marbleised frame. A trompe-l'oeil inscription, seemingly comprising inlaid gilded metal lettering, appears at the top and bottom of the frame. It tells us that the portrait was painted in 1472 when the man was 47 years old.This is the earliest dated portrait by Memling and serves as a crucial milestone for the dating of other portraits from this period, including the Moreel portraits and the donors in the Last Judgment [Gdansk]. The modelling of all these portraits is highly simplified and all the subjects have long, tapering fingers with oval nails.The subject was positively identified as Gilles Joye (1424-1483) on the basis of an old inscription on the reverse and the coat-of-arms. Joye began his career as a canon in the chapter of Our Lady in Cleves (1453-1460), before taking a similar position at St Donatian's in Bruges (after 1463). He later became pastor at the Oude Kerk in Delft (1465- 1469), after which he was made clerk and Kapellmeister of Philip the Good (1462- 1469). He enjoyed some fame as a composer and settled in Bruges in the early 1450s.It is unlikely that the portrait ever belonged to a diptych, because there are no traces of hinges on the still intact frame (although this was assumed to be the case by some scholars). This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that the sitter's coat-of-arms appears on the front and not on the reverse. The painting will ultimately have been commissioned to adorn his tomb in the sacristy of St Donatian's Church, during a period of his life when he was afflicted by illness. Perhaps the portrait was installed there immediately

20080-02hooch.jpg	Military life was a topical subject during the first half of the seventeenth century in the Netherlands. Battle scenes were painted by many Dutch and Flemish artists, Esaias van de Velde and Palamedes Palamedesz being two of the most prolific representatives. During the 1630s and 1640s, when Frederick Hendrick was conducting or threatening campaigns against the Spanish Netherlands, numerous troops, many of them mercenaries, spent months in the United Provinces simply occupying border areas and waiting for orders to come from The Hague. The soldiers interaction with the local population ranged from robbery and extortion to heroic protection and from rape to romance. Idle groups of soldiers were depicted by many Dutch artists such as Pieter Codde, Willem Duyster, David Vinckboons, Jacob Duck and Anthonie Palamedesz. De Hooch's inn scenes descend from many works in this tradition, but above all from recent pictures by Ludolf de Jongh

It was prepared for painting by 1543 but the project to decorate it lasted for several years. Salviati worked there until the autumn of 1545.The main narrative frescoes are drawn from Plutarch and by Livy of the legend of Furius Camillus, a Roman Republican general of the fourth century, earlier represented in a solitary standing pose by Ghirlandaio in the adjacent Sala dei Gigli. The principal subjects of Salviati's work on the dominant east wall consist of Camillus's triumphal entry after the siege of Veii, including the captured statue of Juno, and his battle with the Gauls to save the capitol. The narrative is organized and travels in painted relief from left to right, with the figures painted behind a massive fictive Corinthian order.

44085-09anthon.jpg	Antony of Burgundy was the illegitimate son of Philip the Good and Jeanne de Prelle, and fulfilled military and advisory functions at the Court of Burgundy. During the chapter held at The Hague on 2 May 1456 he was admitted to the Order of the Golden Fleece, on which occasion he received the golden chain with which he is portrayed. This symbolises the personal bond with Philip the Good, the head and founder of the order of knighthood. Flints, steel and sparks, the emblems of Philip the Good, form the links in the chain. The ram's fleece is taken from the mythological legend of Jason, but refers also to Gideon, God's chosen warrior in the Bible. These are exemplary figures, whose heroic deeds were cultivated by the duke and his courtiers.Antony of Burgundy embodies the old knightly ideal which the Burgundian power wished to be seen to aspire to. Court dignitaries, knights, tournament judges and soldiers are frequently depicted with an arrow, as a symbol of office, a token of special distinction or merit, or as an attribute. The arrow could also refer to a position as king of an archery guild, the winner of the annual shooting tournament. In 1463 Antony of Burgundy was king of the St Sebastian Guild in Bruges. If the projectile refers to this commendable achievement, this makes it one of Rogier van der Weyden's last works. In any event, the picture was painted after 1456, when Antony of Burgundy was admitted into the Order of the Golden Fleece. His hairstyle and the high, conical hat point to the period shortly after 1460.Typical of Rogier van der Weyden's art is the low portrait bust in three-quarter profile against a dark, neutral background. Antony of Burgundy's expression is dignified and serene. The face is individualised, but the traits reflect a pattern of softly-flowing curves. In all likelihood the man's real features have been somewhat simplified to give an overly harmonious and therefore somewhat rigid facial expression, which goes to emphasise the impression of distinction. The painter's workmanship appears in the subtle reproduction of textures, in particular of the skin with the soft gradations of the flesh colours. In short, the artist has modelled the knight on an ideal image, whilst retaining his individuality

10984-208david.jpg	"This painting was exhibited at the salon of 1789, its full title was J Brutus, First Consul, returned to his house after having condemned his two sons who had allied themselves with the Tarquins and conspired against Roman liberty the lictors return their bodies so that they may be given burial.In this painting David also deals with the subject of death in service of the state. This was an inflammatory subject in 1789, speaking out for self-sacrifice, the sacrifice of one's own flesh and blood for a higher ideal.Lucius Junius Brutus (not to be confused with Julius Caesar's assassin Marcus Brutus, who lived some 500 years later), had helped to rid Rome of the last of its kings, the tyrannical Tarquin the Proud. This came about because Tarquin's son Sextus had raped the virtuous Lucretia. She then committed suicide in the presence of both her husband Collatinus and Brutus, who withdraw the knife from the fatal wound and swore on Lucretia's blood to avenge her death and destroy the corrupt monarchy. Tarquin was exiled and the first Roman republic was established in 508 BC, with Brutus and Collatinus elected as co-consuls. As the picture title tells us, Brutus' two sons, Titus and Tiberius, were drawn into a royalist conspiracy to return Tarquin, and their father condemned them to death.For the grim and terrible event depicted in the painting, David adopted a radical compositional format. The main character, Brutus, is placed at the extreme left, plunged into deep shadow. His body is tense and knotted as he broods over the consequences of his act, he grasps the death warrant and clenches his feet one across the other. This last detail, in addition to the position of his arms, was probably taken from the figure of the prophet Isaiah on the Sistine Chapel Ceiling by Michelangelo. For the sake of accuracy David based the features of Brutus on a famous antique bust, the so-called Capitoline Brutus, of which he owned a copy. On the other side of the image the inconsolable women are brightly illuminated. The centre of the picture is taken up by a still-life of a sewing basket, an emblem of domesticity, which is rendered in stark clarity.David skillfully illuminated the grief and allegorised the suffering, fear and pain of his figures. He shows the mother, accusing and suffering, her daughter beside her, hands raised defensively, and finally the younger daughter sunk down in pain at her impotence. Another figure at the right edge of the painting personifies grief. In the shadow sits the ""hero"" with the dark mien of a thinker. His features are stoic and harsh, his left hand is holding the written accusation in a claw-like grip, and he is seated in the shadow of the Roma, the symbol of the state to which the sacrifice is ultimately being made. Behind him, the son whose life has fallen victim to the requirements of the state is being borne in. A column strictly divides the theatrical arrangement into the representation of the dark force of destiny and the obvious emotional effect of the event"

42311-1002vela.jpg	"Spain's greatest painter was also one of the supreme artists of all time. A master of technique, highly individual in style, Diego Vel�zquez may have had a greater influence on European art than any other painter. Vel�zquez lived in Madrid as court painter. His paintings include landscapes, mythological and religious subjects, and scenes from common life, called genre pictures. Most of them, however, are portraits of court notables that rank with the portraits painted by Titian and Anthony Van Dyck. Duties of Vel�zquez's royal offices also occupied his time. He was eventually made marshal of the royal household, and as such he was responsible for the royal quarters and for planning ceremonies. Vel�zquez was called the ""noblest and most commanding man among the artists of his country."" He was a master realist, and no painter has surpassed him in the ability to seize essential features and fix them on canvas with a few broad, sure strokes. ""His men and women seem to breathe,"" it has been said; ""his horses are full of action and his dogs of life."" As court painter to Philip IV, Vel�zquez spent a large part of his life recording, in his cool, detached way, the objective appearance of this rigidly conventional royal household, with little interpretation but with the keenest eye for selecting what was important for pictoral expression and with a control of paint to secure exactly the desired effect. In painting these royal portraits, whatever interpretation he made or whatever emotional reaction he experienced he kept to himself. Royalty, courtliness of the most rigid character was his task to portray, not individual personality"

07405-sibyl.jpg	Identified as a portrait of Beatrice Cenci (1577-99), this painting is famous for the tragic story of its subject, a young Roman noblewoman who was immortalized by Stendhal and Dumas. While the canvas was traditionally attributed to Guido Reni, its poor quality in comparison to other works of the master has led many critics to reject it as an autograph work. Instead, it could be by a painter in the immediate circle of Reni. Moreover, the identity of the sitter was also doubted. Nonetheless, misunderstanding continued throughout the twentieth century, with an alternation of confirmations and refutations regarding both the authorship and the identity of the portrayed figure. Finally, in the 1980s, the authorship of Ginevra Cantofoli was accepted and the idealised portrait of the young woman was considered as the representation of a sibyl

12556-landaue.jpg	This work was commissioned by the Nuremberg metal trader Matth&#228;us Landauer. Also known as the Landauer Altarpiece, it was ordered for the chapel of the Twelve-Brothers House, which he endowed for a dozen impoverished artisans.In the centre of the painted panel at the top is the Trinity. God the Father is shown as emperor, holding Christ on the Cross and surmounted by the dove of the Holy Ghost. Around the figure of God are two rings of angels. Below them, to the right, are Old Testament figures and, to the left, followers of Christ bearing palm branches. Nearer the base of the picture are the slightly larger figures of the living, led by the Pope (with a blue tiara) and the Emperor (with a golden crown). The grey-haired figure of Matth&#228;us Landauer, the donor, is depicted on the left, being welcomed into the throng by the outstretched hand of a cardinal.The landscape at the bottom of the panel stretches into the far distance. A lone figure stands on the land - the artist, who has depicted the earthly community being reunited with the realm of heaven. His hand rests on a panel which is inscribed: `Albrecht D�rer of Nuremberg made this 1511 years after the Virgin.'D�rer also designed an ornate frame for the altarpiece. An early drawing for the frame and panel is dated 1508 and shows that they were a carefully designed ensemble. The frame still survives in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, although unfortunately it has long been separated from the painting. (The frame shown in the reproduction is an exact replica of the original.) Made of carved and painted wood, the top of the frame has a sculpted depiction of the Last Judgment, with God enthroned and surrounded by the kneeling figures of the Virgin and John the Baptist. An inscription on the base of the frame records: `Matth&#228;us Landauer has finally completed the house of worship of the Twelve Bretheren including the donation of this panel. After Christ's birth, the year 1511.' D�rer's workshop also designed stained-glass windows for the Twelve-Brothers Chapel, but these were removed in 1810 and were destroyed in Berlin during the Second World War

39822-1concert.jpg	"Cardinal Leopoldo bought this picture in 1654 as a Giorgione and for centuries it has been assigned to him. It was at the end of the nineteenth century that Morelli proposed the attribution to Titian, which, in spite of a recent return to giving it to Giorgione, is generally accepted as the more persuasive, naturally placing it in Titian's Giorgionesque period, that is to say his early years.This painting has been considered a work by the young Titian only since it was last restored in 1976. The faces of the figures at the sides are badly damaged. Only the centre figure and the garment of the figure on the right display his masterful use of colour. Pictures of musicians were frequently painted in the 16th century. However, it was very rare for such an intimate relationship between the musicians to be depicted. The youth on the left draws the observer into the scene, thus including him in the web of glances and touches.The conception and the pictorial rendering appear too full and expansive to allow one to think of Giorgione. Giorgione is considered as the inspirer of the picture, but here there is a greater force than is found in him and a style of painting which is in a certain sense broader. The episode represented (a mere excuse for the presentation of the three ages of man) might well be entitled ""Musical Moment"". While the elegant youth is absent and distracted, while the old monk seems as it were to placate us with his slow gesture and his intense look in which there is a pitiful sense of comprehension, the young monk in the centre in all his fullness of life ""assumes to us the most sublime personification of music and of its bewildering emotions... The figures in the picture are three but such is the intensity of life in the monk who plays than the others seem far away from us - the weakened echoes of great warm voice of passion. (Adolfo Venturi)"" The colour is warm and deep; it constructs, it illumines - the living expression of a security of modelling and design which is present and necessary but is subjugated to the poetry of colour"

23197-40monaco.jpg	Around 1400 the Sienese Lorenzo Monaco had one of the most flourishing workshops in Florence. He produced book illustrations and altarpieces, some for his own monastery. Lorenzo's oeuvre displays an evolution from the Florentine late Trecento manner to the more flowing style of painting generally known as International Gothic, typified by figures delineated by the flowing lines of draperies. Lorenzo deployed the idiom with extraordinary delicacy. Unlike many other painters of the International Gothic, he had a natural talent for monumental figure compositions.Lorenzo's St Jerome forms part of a diptych, accompanying a Madonna of Humility. Even on the small scale of the diptych he has created a figure that dominates the picture surface. What is even more remarkable is that he succeeded in combining the saint, the lion and the study into a single convincing image. Jerome was not a great miracle-worker or preacher, nor did he die for his faith after harrowing torments. He earned his saintly status by translating the Bible into Latin from Greek and Hebrew. That is why Lorenzo portrayed him in a study. The lecturn has two shelves, one holding the book to be translated, the other the translation. St Jerome ranks second in the hierarchy of the Fathers of the Church, and as a cardinal, despite the fact that the office of cardinal was unknown in his own day. That is how he is usually depicted, although Lorenzo preferred to show him as a monk. Jerome's red cardinal's hat can be glimpsed hanging behind the right-hand lectern.Jerome started out as a classic scholar but later he withdrew into the Syrian desert to practice renunciation of the world. Here he had befriended a lion by removing a thorn from its paw. He is usually shown as an old man with a cardinal's hat and accompanied by his loyal and thankful lion

07429-seascape.jpg	"Cappelle was principally a landscape painter, developing a type of scene known as a ""parade"" in which he depicts a gathering of large boats on a calm sea, normally near a port, where they have assembled for an official event"			
25907-stillfig.jpg	In 1753, after four years in the Eternal City, Mel�ndez was recalled by his father to assist with a prestigious commission from Ferdinand VI to illuminate a new set of choir books for the Royal Chapel, to replace those lost in the fire of the Alc�zar in 1734. Despite the high acclaim which his illuminations (which show early signs of his skilful depiction of inanimate objects) received at court, Luis' subsequent four petitions to be appointed royal painter were declined by Charles III. It seems likely that Mel�ndez's archaic miniaturist style and lack of experience beyond that specialised work counted against him, at a time when the royal court required artists adept in producing large-scale works in fresco and canvas (such as Corrado Giaquinto) to decorate the new Palacio Real, as well as proven portrait painters to promote the recent accesion of Charles III in 1759. On completion of his royal illuminations it appears that Mel�ndez received no further commissions at court and as a result the artist began to turn in desperation to the subject which ironically would earn him enduring international fame - still-life painting.It is no co-incidence therefore that the artist's earliest known still-lifes date from around 1759-60. Despite the important tradition of still-life painting during the Spanish Golden Age, the genre had dramatically declined by the second half of the 18th century, with none of the court painters being regular practicioners of the art. For Mel�ndez, still-lifes were a relatively easy commodity to sell, and would typically have been painted on speculation of finding a buyer (rather than on commission). It seems that during the 1760s and 1770s he largely cornered the market in Madrid, being the only significant still-life painter working there at that time

35733-water_foh.jpg	Dutch painting in the 17th century is characterised by the multitude of genres in which individual painters specialised. Jacob Isaacksz. van Ruisdael, the painter of this impressive work, is one of the most important, most versatile and most productive landscape painters of the second half of the century.Ruisdael painted many variations on this theme, a Nordic mountain landscape with rushing waterfall. In his choice of subject matter, he was influenced by Allaert van Everdingen, another landscape painter. Unlike the latter, however, Ruisdael had never been to Scandinavia, and so his paintings were based not so much on studies from nature as on van Everdingen's example and his own powers of imagination.Yet what the viewer encounters in Ruisdael's painting is not merely an apparent representation of the visible in a seemingly realistic snapshot; his imposing, often vertical compositions also have a spiritual dimension in their symbolic reference to the transient. The apparent realism becomes an instrument for a deeper level of meaning. The passage of human life might be compared with the powerful waterfall, plunging downwards over the rocky steps. The constant flow of foaming water over craggy stone formations offers an allegory of human life as ceaseless struggle, and suggests its transience. Alongside this moral and dialectical purpose is a poetical element deriving from the heroic aspect of the subject matter and the dramatic opposition of light and shade, the theatrical contrast of the lighting creating its own specific atmosphere

07151-canal101.jpg	This is one of a set of four paintings by Canaletto, usually regarded as his earliest surviving vedute (view paintings) of Venice. They may have been executed for a Venetian patron, possibly as decoration for the portego of a Venetian palazzo, but are first recorded in the collection of the Princes of Liechtenstein in 1806. It is a work of such extraordinary accomplishment that it is hard to believe it was not preceded by other, now lost, studies by the artist.Unlike other pictures from the same set, it shows a part of the city not found on the itinerary of most visitors. This is an area where Venetians live and work, rather than a well-known site. At the left the footway runs along before the church of San Lazzaro dei Mendicanti and the Scuola di San Marco. A wooden bridge spans the canal, while beyond it can be seen the Ponte del Cavallo. The artist has particularly exploited the colourful laundry hung out from the rooftops and windows at the right. There is a heavy, ponderous atmosphere, achieved through the dappled treatment of the silvery light and feathery brushstrokes. This approach, which in part anticipates the work of the Venetian painter Francesco Guardi (1712-93), is characteristic of Canaletto's earliest pictures.

The panel was sold for the Acquisitions Fund in 2013.By the time this panel was executed in 1472, Giovanni Bellini had taken over as the dominant artistic personality in Venice and his influence was felt almost immediately. Indeed, the design of the present panel, with its background curtain and supportive parapet beneath the Child, the majesty of the figures, and the archaic Byzantine feel of the Child clothed, is indebted to Bellini's Madonna Greca. In view of the artistic developments introduced by Bellini, the gold background would already have begun to seem somewhat retardataire, but it was a feature which Bartomoleo was to use repeatedly. The wide-rimmed halos are recurring features of Vivarini's style in the 1470s

For a long time it was thought that this polyptych had been destroyed but recently a group of scholars have reconstructed its original appearance and traced the various pieces in several museums and collections throughout the world: the central panel was the Madonna and Child now in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum in Cologne, while the side panels are the three panels in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge and a St Catherine in an Italian private collection.The design of the polyptych with all the panels on a single register, the round-arch shape of the panels, as well as a rather archaic solidity of the figures and their severe and solemn rhythms, all suggest a fairly early dating: after Assisi (and there is a great similarity with the saints on the underside of the arch), but undoubtedly before the more Gothic Pisa Polyptych. Scholars almost unanimously agree that this polyptych is the autograph work of Simone, who probably also painted a Blessing Christ to be placed above the central panel

17204-olive06.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 716, JH 1878.By moving to Saint-R�my in 1889 van Gogh found a new set of motifs that captured his interest. He discovered the olive groves and cypresses, which became quintessential images of Provence for him. For the present canvas of an olive grove he chose a bird's eye view from a distance, possibly standing on another hill. The decorative bands of colour are based on a common feature of the Saint-R�my landscape where the hilly ground forces the farmers to create terraces in order to plant the trees. It invited the artist to create patterns of colour alternating between reddish brown and yellowish green that introduce a complementary colour contrast. The shape of the trees was yet another element that allowed him to add a level of stylisation. The overall result is a highly decorative canvas of distinctive style

05442-13holofe.jpg	The picture was probably created in pendant with The Return of Judith; both of them are documented at the end of 16th century in medicean collections, where entered as a gift received by Bianca Cappello, the second wife of Grand Duke Francesco I. In Renaissance art the biblical story of Judith, the heroine who killed Holofernes oppressor of her people, was frequently selected to symbolize liberty and victory on tyranny.The soldiers are standing in dismay around the bed on which the headless body of their commander Holofernes is lying. They had expected to find him in Judith's arms, who, however, is already hurrying home. There is only a brief description of the scene in the Bible, and it clearly stimulated Botticelli's imagination. When compared to the other painting, however, the youthful well-formed body presents us with a contradiction: in that painting, the cut off head of Holofernes has the features of an older bearded man.

23031-1good1.jpg	Ambrogio Lorenzetti frescoed the side walls of the Council Room (Sala dei Nove) of the City Hall (Palazzo Pubblico) of Siena. The size of the room is 2,96 x 7,70 x 14,40 m. The subject of the frescoes are the Good and Bad Government and their effects on the life of the cities and villages.The Allegory of the Good Government is situated on the smaller wall opposite to the windows. The composition is built up from three horizontal bands. In the foreground the figures of contemporary Siena are represented. Behind them, on a stage, there are allegoric figures in two groups, representing the Good Government. The two groups are connected by the procession of the councillors. The upper band indicates the heavenly sphere with the floating bodyless ghosts of the virtues.The enthroned man on the right side of the middle band represents the city of Siena and embodies the Good Government. Around his head the four letters C S C V (Commune Saenorum Civitatis Virginis) explain his identity. At his feet the two plating children are the sons of Remus, Ascius and Senius, the founders of Siena according to the Roman legends. On both sides of Siena the virtues of Good Government are represented by six crowned, stately female figures: Peace, Fortitude and Prudence on the left, Magnanimity, Temperance and Justice on the right. On the far left of the fresco the figure of Justice is repeated as she is balancing the scales held by Wisdom.Below the fresco there is the signature of the painter: AMBROSIUS LAURENTII DE SENIS HIC PINXIT UTRINQUE

17769-501goya1.jpg	Goya's Majas (fashionable young women) are two of his most famous and most discussed masterpieces. Their date, for whom they were painted and the identity of the model are problems that are still not satisfactorily solved. The first mention of The Nude Maja is in the diary of the medallist Pedro Gonzalez de Sepulveda describing a visit in November 1800 to the house of the Minister, Manuel Godoy, Goya's patron and the target of his satire: 'In an apartment or inner cabinet are pictures of various Venuses... [among them] a naked one by Goya, without design or delicacy of colouring' and Vel�zquez's 'famous Venus'. There is no mention of The Clothed Maja and presumably it was not there, probably not yet painted.Godoy's position at court and his known taste for paintings of female nudes (there were many others in his collection) makes it likely that both Majas were painted for him. An alternative suggestion is that they were in the Duchess of Alba's collection and acquired by Godoy after her death, together with Vel�zquez's The Toilet of Venus and other pictures. Goya's relations with the Duchess of Alba have made her the most popular candidate as a model for the Majas, at least as a source of inspiration, supported by the many drawings of herself and members of her household he made during his visit to the Duchess's country estate. The lack of resemblance to the heads of Goya's earlier portraits of her is usually explained by the need to conceal her identity. Whoever the model may have been and for whomever the pictures were made, Goya's nude Maja is unique and unprecedented in his oeuvre and in Spain, even in Europe, in his time. Vel�zquez's Venus, which Goya must have seen in the Duchess of Alba's collection, is its only comparable predecessor in the life-like portrayal of the female nude. But where the Vel�zquez is also a mythological painting, Goya's The Nude Maja makes no pretence of being anything but the rendering of a naked woman lying on a couch

23997-zeno01.jpg	"For the main altar of the Veronese church of San Zeno, Mantegna produced one of the finest and most influential altarpieces of the period. The altarpiece occupies a privileged position in the church, because the main altar area is raised above the level of the nave, and a special window was opened to increase the amount of light on the picture. The design of the elaborate gilt wood frame is probably based upon Donatello's high altar for the Paduan church dedicated to Saint Anthony, which, however, included bronze statues and reliefs rather than paintings. At the base are three large, nearly square predella scenes. These panels are copies, the originals were taken by Napoleon and are now in French museums.The painting is an early masterpiece of the young Mantegna. Although the basic format of the painting is essentially that of the late Gothic polyptychs it nevertheless breaks new grounds in the way this traditional scheme is handled. The stage upon which the holy gathering takes place is set against an ""open air"" background. The garlands suspended from the proscenium which appear to thread between the simulated columns of the painting and the actual wooden ones of the frame, dissolve the idea of the fourth wall of the traditional perspective box. The spacial games of this painting have come a long way from Brunelleschi's method of projecting the painted image onto an ideal plane. Perspective has now become a sophisticated means of achieving concrete reality"

His first securely dated work, the Gesuati Polyptych with its noble portrait of the kneeling Colombini, was painted when he was already almost forty. But over the next few decades, Sano's workshop would turn out repetitive assemblies of stereotyped saints (the Siena Pinacoteca alone counts more than forty altarpieces of this kind). Only in his delightful small predella scenes does some vestige of his earlier poetic invention surface again.This triptych is from the late period of the artist.

39456-2desert.jpg	The church of San Giorgio Maggiore was built on the San Giorgio Island between 1566 and 1600 using the design of Palladio. After 1590 the workshop of Tintoretto was commissioned to paint big canvases for decorating it. Due the large number of commissions, Tintoretto in his late years increasingly relied on his coworkers. However, three surviving paintings placed in a chapel consacrated in 1592 - The Jews in the Desert, The Last Supper and The Entombment - were certainly painted by Tintoretto himself.The unusual iconography of this painting is still not entirely explained. There is much to suggest that Tintoretto was depicting the Israelites' scorning of the manna that led to the plague of fiery serpents and finally the setting up of the bronze serpent. Or the picture may combine different themes: the camp of the Israelites in the oasis of Elim, the washing of their clothes at the foot of Mount Sinai, the making of the copper basin for the sanctuary, the cooking of the manna, etc. The figure of Moses right foreground, shown in conversation with Aaron, is intentionally made to resemble Christ. Moses forms a typological link with the painting opposite, The Last Supper. As so often in Tintoretto, a certain scriptural meaning is concealed behind details that appear to be merely those of genre painting: the donkey driver top right could be Balaam who beat his animal because it was afraid of the angel of the Lord, whom Balaam himself did not see

21714-p_family.jpg	This painting is the collective work of Louis and Antoine Le Nain. The three brothers produced their work collectively. This is supported by the fact that they never used any other form of signature but 'Le Nain', as a kind of studio stamp. It explains the existence of complex pictures where brilliant passages of paintings are to be found alongside mediocre areas executed by assistants or pupils. But there are also others of a high level where the brothers worked alone or with each other, without help from outsiders.The Louvre has two paintings depicting peasant families by Le Nain, one of them is an austere and virile work. This one, however, strikes a note of profound intimacy, a warmth of spirit, like the atmosphere of a domestic festivity.The general harmony of greys and browns is in keeping with the spirit of austerity reigning in French painting in the time of Louis XIII. Unlike the Flemings, who made their scenes of rustic life an occasion for depicting the unleashing of the coarsest sensual instincts, Louis Le Nain saw in the peasant soul a profound gravity, even solemnity; the expression of a life of toil whose hard realities have bestowed on it a sense of its own dignity. The paint quality is flowing and rich, with touches of impasto used not simply for effect, as in the work of Frans Hals, but giving proof of a sensitive brush, searching out the modelling with attention and feeling.Several early copies give evidence of the paintings reputation.

08908-madonna.jpg	The picture originally stood on the high altar of Santa Trinit&#224; church in Florence. The iconography is frequent in medieval painting and represents the Madonna enthroned with Child and angels, a pattern commonly said Maest&#224; as shows the Virgin as Queen of Paradise. In the lower part are four biblical figures, symbolizing foundations of Christ's kingdom: the prophets Jeremiah and Isaiah under lateral arches, Abraham and King David under the chair of the throne.This Madonna, which is similar in structure to the same artist's Madonna at the Louvre and Duccio's Ruccelai Madonna, still shows the influence of the Byzantine tradition. There is, however, an unprecedented tension in the profiles and in the attempt to create spatial depth, which is rendered by superimposing the figures and in the concave structure at the base of the throne behind the figures of the prophets. The architectural structure of the throne becomes a sort of robust spatial scheme which creates a three-dimensional effect, while the edges of the painting seem to compress and hold in the bodies. There is an intense vitality in the figures and the same dramatic force that characterizes all Cimabue's work.Restored in 199

25952-st_anne.jpg	This painting is a fairly faithful copy of Leonardo's The Virgin and Child with St Anne in the Louvre. The picture in Florence differs from Leonardo's in the landscape, which is entirely reformulated here, and a few, yet significant, details, such as the foreground in which an alluvial riverbank is replaced by a sumptuous meadow. A possible explanation of the differences could be that the painter of the Florence version used as model not Leonardo's painting but his cartoon (now lost) which probably showed only the figures without Leonardo's final alterations, and no landscape at all.Traditionally the painting is attributed to Gian Giacomo Caprotti, called Salai, Leonardo's rakish and ill-reputed pupil. However, on basis of stylistic similarities with Melzi's signed Vertumnus and Pomona, it is now attributed to Francesco Melzi

07163-canal204.jpg	Canaletto was to return to paint this scene on no less than twelve occasions in the 1720s and 1730s. This is a view from beside the Campo San Vio, looking towards the Bacino San Marco, with the dome of Santa Maria della Salute above the palaces at the right.Canaletto has included a curious detail: a depiction of a boat on the wall of the building in the right foreground. Whether this was simply sgraffito or some form of trade sign is not entirely clear. Above it a woman looks down from a small balcony; Canaletto placed similar figures at the edge of a number of his pictures, in order to close off the scene. He also perhaps was trying to convince us that there were in fact vantage points from which the panoramas he shows could be viewed.This work is from a group of early pictures by Canaletto, now in Dresden, which were part of the Elector of Saxony's collection during Canaletto's lifetime

20872-stillif.jpg	"This is a typical illustration of the type of still-life of which Kalf was an outstanding specialist. The still-lifes by Kalf look very different from those of his predecessors (like Pieter Claesz. and Willem Heda). They are, in a sense, much more theatrical; in their sonorous quality they bring to mind the landscapes of his contemporary, Jacob van Ruisdael.In the paintings by Heda or Pieter Claesz., the objects are ordered in a simple way; they are just laid out on the table. The light is even; shadows are used only to emphasize each object's plastic form. The still-life is generally set in a rather wide space (the painting itself being oblong). In Kalf's paintings, however, the space is narrowed. The backgrounds is much darker; and in this narrow space, against this background, the still-life seems curiously isolated. A soft light picks out each different object, showing its unique quality and colour, as spotlights focus on actors on a dark stage. In the narrow space, the arrangement too is much tighter.For this rich, glowing kind of still-life the 17th centuy used an apt term, ""pronkstilleven"" (still-life of ostentation); and part of the content of this term is certainly the choice of objects itself. In Heda and Claesz. food and utensils appear that belong to normal life: bread, beer, fish, plates and jugs of pewter or ordinary glass. Kalf (and his contemporary Abraham van Beyeren too) uses almost exclusively objects that are extraordinary: vessels of silver and gold, chalices of china, lobster, tropical fruit, displayed against rich Persian cloth"

33649-08landsc.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 452.This small painting is Rembrandt's only known winter landscape. His precise depiction of an everyday country scene gives the impression that Rembrandt painted the work on the spot, out of doors. In reality, though, the artist produced his landscape paintings in the studio, working from sketches.For the most part, Rembrandt reserved his direct responses to the flat, open countryside of his native land for his drawings and etchings. Very few of his painted landscapes show the same naturalism of approach and, of those that do, the Winter Landscape is the only one not to be partly veiled in shadow. It was not painted from nature as artists did not work out of doors at that time of year, but its small size and broad handling suggest that it was a sketch. It is less decorative than other Dutch winter landscapes of the period, and the depiction of the weather is startlingly realistic.

15200-annunc.jpg	This painting dates from Gentileschi's time in Genoa (an earlier version of the same subject is in the church of S. Siro in Genoa) and is probably his most celebrated work, often considered his masterpiece. The huge red drape hanging behind the Madonna's pure white bed is an overt homage to Caravaggio. Indeed it is to him that the canvas owes its overall sense of vibrant reality, its light and its feeling.Nevertheless, Gentileschi reworked the basic style of Caravaggio's expressive art in an unusually rich fashion.

07783-90apothe.jpg	"Canvas No. 9 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".The Apotheosis of St Ursula and her Followers, signed and dated 1491 on the cartouche below the circle of angels' heads around the palm-trunk, is also one of the earlier canvases of the cycle. The theory, supported by some scholars, that this altarpiece actually dates from 1510 when Carpaccio supposedly repainted it since the original version had been badly damaged, has been disproved by a recent X-ray of the whole painting (which has, incidentally, revealed that the three splendid male portraits to the left are later additions).But the theory can also be disproved by a stylistic analysis: compare it, for instance, to the Presentation in the Temple, which dates from around 1510, also in the Accademia. The complexity of the perspective foreshortening of the marble aedicula, of the furled banners, of the figure of Ursula surrounded by angels and with God the Father looking down at her, is far too self-conscious and still too close to the style of Mantegna to be the work of the established artist active around 1510. Both the central episode of the composition and the heads of the virgin martyrs crowded in the lower part of the painting show quite clearly that this altarpiece dates from the same stylistic period as the painting depicting the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne. And even the artist's reluctance to reconcile the devotional and iconographical aspect of the work to the narrative and dramatic elements, which he was more interested in, suggest an early dating.The most poetic element of this painting are certainly the two Venetian landscape details, with their lively and fresh colours, and the loving precision with which he describes the hills, the urban fabric, the countryside, the events of daily life"

09836-courb101.jpg	Shortly after his arrival in Paris, Courbet made a very important acquaintance, that of the genre-painter Fran�ois Bonvin. From him he learnt the sacrosanct ritual of copying old masters in the Mus�e du Luxembourg and the Louvre. Following in the footsteps of G�ricault, Chass�riau and Delacroix, Courbet discovered the Venetian and Bolognese schools of Italian Renaissance painting, the northern Baroque of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the works of Vel�zquez, Zurbar�n and Murillo. The principal surviving records of this period are his copies of Guercino's Vision of St Jerome (1840) and Lot and his Daughters .

03025-12pyramu.jpg	This painting depicts the story of Pyramus and Thisbe as Ovid tells in Metamorphoses (4:55-166). The lovers, forbidden by their parents to marry, planned to meet in secret one night beside a spring. Thisbe arrived first but as she waited a lioness, fresh from a kill, came to quench its thirst, its jaws dripping blood. Thisbe fled, in her haste dropping her cloak which the beast proceeded to tear to shreds. When Pyramus arrived and discovered the bloody garment he believed the worst. Blaming himself for his lover's supposed death he plunged his sword into his side. Thisbe returned to find her lover dying and so, taking his sword, threw herself upon it. This story became widely popular in post-Renaissance painting

21449-swing.jpg	"Lancret is regarded alongside Jean-Baptiste Pater as the most important representative of the many artists influenced by Watteau, most of whom chose individual motifs or groups from his ""fete galante"" and made them independent themes. This process alone is indicative of a specific tendency in Rococo: the tendency towards small scale, intimate scenes. In Lancret's painting The Swing we find a highly popular motif of the time, treated not only by Fragonard, Boucher and Pater, but also by lesser painters of the era. Just what made the swing such a popular theme becomes clear here.It is not only the erotic aura, whose ""moment of happiness"" is to be found in a glimpse under the petticoats, but also the fact that the swing is a metaphor of an interim realm belonging neither to the earth nor to the air. It remains intangible, allocated neither to an element nor to a physical place. Non-committal coquettishness, the freedom of intimacy, the bonds that do not tie: all these are evoked by the rope with which the desiring cavalier is moving the swing, not as a symbol, but certainly as an obvious suggestion"

29231-2reale.jpg	During his fifty-year reign (1680-1730) Vittorio Amadeo II transformed Turin, the second royal residence on Italian soil after Naples, into one of the most splendid Baroque cities in Europe. In 1584 he started the enlargement of the palace known as the Palazzo Reale. The additions to the palace were patterned after the models of French court architecture, but for the wall decorations he looked for Italian painters. The decoration continued under the reign of Carlo Emanuele III (1730-1773). In addition to painters from Rome and Venice, Neapolitan painters also made a significant contribution to the decoration.Francesco de Mura within a period of roughly eighteen months (1741-43) painted five ceilings in the king's summer apartment, part of which occupied the north wing. His subjects were taken from Greek mythology, and four of these ceilings have survived in what was subsequently turned into an archive.

After his marriage to Carline Bommer in 1818, he produced paintings that include the figure of a woman. In the Man and Woman Looking at the Moon Friedrich has portrayed himself and his wife gazing at the moon in Romantic wonderment. This painting is probably one of the most ardent acknowledgements of their relationship. There is a variant on the motif, Two Men Looking at the Moon (Dresden), painted in c. 1820.

00107-vasewatc.jpg	Willem van Aelst was a still-life specialist prized for his lovely flower and fruit pieces, and he has been mentioned as a sometime follower of Kalf. The eminent flower painter Rachel Ruysch was his pupil.This floral still-life has symbolic significance. The blooms, shown in all their glory, already imply the fading and dying that is to come, a reminder of the transience of beauty. A similar idea is communicated by the holes eaten in the leaves, while the open pocket-watch serves to suggest the passage of earthly time, as well as standing more generally for the importance of good measure. Yet the hour cannot be read from the face of the watch, and this might suggest that time is not passing, that the painter has brought time to a standstill in his work, overcoming the very transience of things.

The narration of the event shows the boy bearing the good news, Cicogna's restrained surprise, and the more enthusiastic congratulations of the hospitaler, Priamo Balbi.In the third scene, before the dignitaries of the Church and a group of Venetian nobles, the ubiquitous Priamo Balbi ushers two elderly women from the hospital into the presence of the new doge, who has already assumed the solemn demeanour that befits his station.

12573-6apostl1.jpg	Two idealized portraits by D�rer depict the two apostles, Philip and James the Elder. The compositions are very simple, with D�rer showing just the head and shoulders. Only the inscriptions, and the scallop shell symbol on the red gown of James, identify them as apostles. D�rer has portrayed them in an anguished state, with heads slightly bent, furrowed brows, piercing eyes and dropped lower lips. Grief has aged them and their intricately painted beards give them the appearance of wise old men. D�rer probably intended the two portraits to be part of a set of paintings of the 12 apostles

34412-kitchen.jpg	The increasing interest in everyday reality was clearly expressed in the second half of the 16th century in the genre of market and kitchen scenes. Although images like this are not just straightforwardly realistic representations, their artistic significance lies in the lively and coherent manner in which the artist managed to represent a profusion of objects and foods. The genre was also popular in the 17th century and was practised in both the Northern and Southern Netherlands. An interesting example, illustrating a common pictorial type, is The Kitchen Maid, attributed to Pieter Cornelisz van Rijck (I568-I628). It shows a central female figure in a larder surrounded by still-life elements. She poses with her hand on a cabbage - a common erotic allusion in paintings of this kind

15238-6coronat.jpg	This is a case where a comparison will give a good idea of how differently the same subject was handled by Jacques-Louis David and one of his numerous pupils. The pupil was Fran�ois G�rard who was also commissioned to paint a coronation, that of Charles X in 1827. The heavy draperies of the baldachin (brocade canopy), the costumes and the sweeping gestures look back to the Baroque, as might be expected at the Restauration. It is significant that the centre of the painting is not occupied by the act of coronation but by the bishop, who is standing with his back to the king, his eyes raised in suppliance to heaven.

A small version, possibly the model for the large painting, is in the Galleria Corsini, Rome. The scrolls borne by the angels bear the inscription in Latin: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill towards men (Luke II, I4); another popular subject in El Greco's repertoire, painted throughout his life. It was one of the subjects of the Modena Triptych, and of his first commission in Spain, that for the church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, and was the subject chosen for his own burial chapel in Santo Domingo.A comparison with the earlier painting of the same subject in Santo Domingo shows the advance made in the process of developing a style appropriate to the expression of the supernatural. There is no reference to the ordinary conception of space of this world, there are no allusions to the corporal quality of the figures, whose gestures also belong to the realm of imagination and not to that of ordinary experience. Light is the important dematerialising and expressive element in this painting. The Santo Domingo painting can still be related to a human event

38627-v_feast.jpg	After the refined realism of Brouwer, genre painting reverted to a more decorative concept, in keeping with the general character of Flemish art of the period. The driving force behind this development was David Teniers the Younger, who became a leading figure in this branch of painting, thanks to his remarkable productivity and the high esteem he enjoyed. The Village Feast is one of his many paintings of village life, a recurring theme throughout his oeuvre. In scenes like this, he depicts humble peasants as the upper classes liked to see them portrayed: as simple, unthinking creatures gratefully enjoying their humble existence. But Teniers raises such scenes to a higher artistic level through his skilful composition, balanced coloration and above all the radiant light which illuminates his paintings

13441-port_man.jpg	Fabre was a pupil of Jacques-Louis David in Paris, but spent much of his career in Italy: from 1787 in Rome and then from 1793 in Florence, where he was particularly connected with the English expatriate community. He specialised in half-length society portraits; their crisp design and minute attention to detail were largely inspired by David's paintings. He gradually produced a wider range of works, painting history pictures and landscapes, and was also active as a dealer, printmaker and enthusiastic collector. It is, above all, for his collection rather than his paintings that he is now best known; it is housed in the Mus�e Fabre in his native Montpellier and includes a number of important sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italian paintings, as well as a wide selection of the artist's own work.Fabre returned briefly to Paris (1809-10) and this intense and sensitive portrait of a fashionably dressed young man is dated to the first year of this visit. It bears a pencil inscription on the unpainted edge of the canvas: M Camille, which is presumably a reference to the as yet unknown sitter. His dishevelled hair is arranged in the so-called 'a la Titus' antique style which was then in vogue

39133-01zianig1.jpg	Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo decorated with frescoes the family villa at Zianigo which his father, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo had bought on his return from the task of decorating the Prince-Bishop's palace in W�rzburg and which he had restored and altered to his own needs. The frescoes were painted over a fairly long period of time: between 1759 - the date shown on one of the monochrome scenes from the chapel - and 1797 - according to a now lost inscription read at the beginning of the twentieth century in a mural scene in the Pulcinella Room. Almost all the frescoes in the small Zianigo villa were detached in 1906 and in 1936 they were moved to the Ca' Rezzonico and placed in small rooms, in a recomposition that closely repeats the original one, though with some differences and overlapping.The frescoes in the villa depict the stories of Pulcinella (also Punchinello, a classical character that originated in the Commedia dell'arte of the 17th century), scenes of villa life, games, the wars and affections of satyrs and fauns. It is a comprehensive cycle which Giovanni Domenico painted for himself in successive stages in the non-monumental rooms of the country house. When completed, the whole Zianigo work was a kind of grand recapitulation of many aspects and idiosyncrasies of Giovanni Domenico's art, while also representing the cultural passing of a period and a style. It is almost a pictorial testament which, while valuing the past, did not conceal the drama of the present nor the uncertainty of the future.In the Pulcinella Room, the absolute protagonist of the decoration is Pulcinella. The gaunt figure in the Neapolitan mask dominates the room. On the ceiling The Swing of Pulcinella is depicted. The three large wall scenes depicts Pulcinella in Love, Pulcinella and the Tumblers, and Pulcinella's Departure. Four monochrome scenes above the doors, two of them oblong in format, complete the decoration of the upper portion of the room

""In a lonely rocky area stands Goethe's sarcophagus, and upon it a harp; moonlight falls through its strings, illuminating two angels who kneel reverently before it. Mists swirl around the base of the monument. It would seem that Goethe's manifold and magical contacts with Nature have inspired the ingenious artist to this Ossianic idea.""Goethe, who devoted himself so intensively to questions of the world and humanity, has been recast in Carus's picture into an unworldly and lonely Romantic figure.

03980-bello208.jpg	This painting is considered to be Bellotto's first view of Dresden. Sitting at the centre before the city backdrop is a draughtsman who can only be Bellotto himself. An older man in a green coat points out the painting's subject to Bellotto, while a second man with a round, reddened head stands behind him to the left. No historical sources exist to help us identify these and the figures further to the right, but tradition has it that the more corpulent figure is the court painter Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich, who was simultaneously inspector of the K�nigliche Gem&#228;ldegalerie, and that the older man is Johann Alexander Thiele, Bellotto's predecessor as vedutista at the court of Dresden. The gentlemen further to the right have been identified as the royal physician Filippo di Violante, the corpulent countertenor Niccol&#242; Pozzi (known as Niccolini), one of the court Turks, and &#151; standing slightly apart &#151; the court-jester Fr�hlich. Only the last can be definitively identified, for he is known from contemporary illustrations that show him wearing the costume of the Salzkammergut region of Austria.The painting has a pendant, assuredly the most famous view of Dresden, which is taken from the same side of the Elbe but from a point further downstream, below the Augustusbr�cke. That composition, dating from 1748, more or less mirrors the work on view here so that the diagonal course of the river in the two pictures is symmetrically arranged

41338-04virgi.jpg	The painting is split into five sections. The central part shows the Virgin and Child Enthroned. There are two scenes to their left and right - The Birth of the Virgin, Annunciation, Nativity and Assumption. The vertical division, in which the central part is separated from the sides by two painted columns, is a precursor of the triptych altarpieces and enables us to identify the painting as Tuscan or Umbrian. In 1949 from a faint inscription found beneath Mary's feet the painting was identified as the work of Simeone and Machilone of Spoleto. These Umbro-Sienese masters worked in Ancona, Florence, Pisa, Siena and Orvieto, absorbing the influence of all those centres.The painting has a Byzantine feel and is strongly influenced by the Sienese and Florentine schools. The architectural structure in the scenes showing the Birth of the Virgin and the Annunciation is Sienese. Whereas Marian cycles in the Byzantine tradition generally culminated in the assumption of Mary's soul, this painting focuses on the bearing of her body to heaven. This is a Western theme which only became truly popular in Italy in the 14th century, establishing itself first in Sienese art. The Annunciation scene, in which Mary turns from the angel in fright, also betrays a Sienese influence. By contrast, the throne on which she sits, the drapery of her robe and her facial type are all specifically Florentine. The Birth of the Virgin and the Nativity have the same composition. The drowsing Joseph in the latter scene is interesting, as are the two midwives bathing the infant. The more anecdotal elements of the image derive from apocryphal texts

26194-eroticsc.jpg	In the fourteenth century, heated chambers in patrician houses that served as both bedroom and living room were often elaborately painted, but the standard decorations were trees, plants  of all kinds, coats of arms, and imaginary patterned draperies. One rarely finds an actual narration of the sort appropriate, for example, even for a bridal chamber. Even more uncommon are cycles representing either episodes or whole narrative sequences from the lives of actual lovers as opposed to fictional ones. An example is in the Palazzo del Podest&#224; in San Gimignano. Here the erotic scenes were executed in a vaulted room in a tower (in the Camera del Podest&#224;), and they reflect the ideals and the way of life of a courtly society

However, lacking certified portraits of the artist, the identification is only a plausible hypothesis based on the resemblance of the sitter to other figures in El Greco's paintings that have also been thought to record the artist's features. There are several assumed self-portraits of the artist included in his compositions from the early Healing of the Blind to the Burial of Count Orgaz, then to the Pentecost, Marriage of the Virgin and the Adoration of the Shepherds.Regardless of the identification of the sitter, this is a fine and particularly compelling portrait by the artist, with the features painted with great sensitivity.

In the first decade of the seventeenth century artists from all corners of Italy and Europe descended on the Eternal City to create a flourishing artistic scene. Northern artists brought with them the use of copper as a support, a development which provided Italian painters with a novel vehicle to produce different textures and finishes to their painted surfaces.

32288-16rebecc.jpg	Some of Poussin's pictures painted in the latter half of the 1640s can be dated. They include Rebecca at the Well, painted for Pointel in 1648, where the large scale and almost frozen quality of the figures is the same as that of the Edinburgh Sacraments. In such pictures Poussin seems to have lost the art of charging each figure with a living emotion, as he had done in the first set of Sacraments, and there is an increased gravity at the expense of humanity; but some people see this as the summit of Poussin's achievement just because it is such an extreme.The biblical story depicted in the painting is the following.The patriarch Abraham, wishing to find a wife for her son Isaac, sent his servant Eliezer, to look for a suitable bride amaong his own kindred in Mesopotamia, rather than among the people of Canaan where he dwelt. When the servant reached the city of Nahor in Chaldea he prayed for guidance, asking that whoever gave him and his camels water at the well would be an eligible woman. This proved to be Rebecca, a virgin, one of the family of Abraham throrugh his brother Nahor. She invited Eliezer to drink from her jar, and drew water for his camels. Eliezer gave his presents of gold and received hospitality at her parents' house. He then took her back to Canaan

28344-farnese.jpg	Mochi was an early representant of the Baroque sculpture. With his dynamic style he can be considered as a forerunner of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. He initiated the transformation of the Renaissance equestrian statues into the more dynamic Baroque type. His two works, the equestrian statues of Ranuccio and Francesco Farnese stand in the main square of Piacenza. In the latter the relation of the horse and rider is very well resolved.When in 1612 the Piacenza authorities decided to set up twin equestrian monuments, one to Ranuccio Farnese, the ruling duke, and the other to his father, Alessandro, they did not commission the pupils of Giovanni da Bologna, who held the monopoly for equestrian statues, but called upon the young Tuscan artist Francesco Mochi. After completing the sketches, the artist had a quarrel with the founder and cast the bronzes himself. In the earlier statue of Ranuccio, Mochi is still steeped in Mannerist culture, but in the Alessandro monument he succeeded in breaking new ground, creating a powerful, moving work, whose originality was not grasped by his contemporaries

For instance, paintings of children at school, a theme popularised by Gerrit Dou, resounded with references to learning, vigilance, and studiousness.

11699-5predel2.jpg	The Magnoli Altarpiece had five predella panels which are now in the museums of Washington, Cambridge and Berlin. They were probably originally arranged in the same order as the saints appear in the main panel, that is: The Stigmatization of St Francis, St John in the Wilderness (both in the National Gallery, Washington), Annunciation, St Zenobius Performs a Miracle (in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) and the Martyrdom of St Lucy (in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin). In the predella we find the same pale and delicate colours as in the main panel, but handled with greater freedom and more loosely blended  together. In some scenes, like the St John in the Wilderness for example, the colours and the light are the true protagonists. This scene is also interesting from an iconographical point of view, for it is the only known depiction of St John in the wilderness at the moment when he is removing his worldly clothes to don the camel skin, the symbol of his vocation

12014-pesaro.jpg	The decoration of large halls with the deeds of the nobility and their ancestors was intended to inspire the viewer's admiration. The depiction of such events from the recent past has a long tradition. Most such cycles in the first half of the sixteenth century, however, are dedicated to a single person or event, as for example, in the Villa Imperiale. By contrast, from the middle of the century onward this genre was increasingly devoted to the representation of dynasties.Pragmatic reasons were behind the success of the idea, derived from Raphael and his workshop, of making mural painting that simulated tapestries. Sometimes the possibility of pulling the tapestries aside was used to integrate doors or windows into the decoration. In other cases a tapestry was quite consciously used to introduce a second narrative level into the depiction. Around 1530 Eleonora Gonzaga commissioned a decorative scheme for the Villa Imperiale, which would be unique in formal and thematic terms, that focused primarily on the classical themes of the villa as a place of leisure and its associated activities. This can be seen in the many vegetal motifs and landscapes, the implements of hunting and music depicted in the vault of the Sala delle Cariatidi, and the personifications of the arts in the Sala dei Semibusti. By contrast, the deeds of her husband, Francesco Maria della Rovere, the duke of Urbino, are all presented as simulated tapestries, that is as paintings within the painting, twice removed from reality. This contrast immediately conveys the distance between the life of recreation in the villa and the political and martial actions of Eleonora's husband

13787-tobias_h.jpg	Several other versions of this painting are known from the artist.The story is recounted in the Book of Tobit. Tobias was sent by his father Tobit to Media to recover a sum of money he had hidden there earlier. Archangel Raphael, sent by God to help Tobit and his family, asked Tobit (who did not recognize the angel) whether he may escort his son on his journey and, in company with Tobias' faithful hound, they departed together. They reached the Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. The archangel ordered him to capture it and had him remove and conserve its gall, heart and liver. The innards proved to be a medicine which he can use to restore his father's sight

36597-infancy.jpg	In this painting, the direct impact of the Titian's Diana and Actaeon is evident in the picturesquely rusticated classical architecture on the left background, and especially in the descending chain of mountains on the right. In the left foreground, the infant Jupiter is shown with three nymphs and the goat Amalthea, to whom he was entrusted by his mother to protect him from his child-eating father Cronus. The wild Curetes, whose noise helped save the infant by drowning his cries, are interpreted by the painter as musicians playing Renaissance viola da gambas and a recorder. Despite his lack of interest in anatomical accuracy, Schiavone succeeds in investing his composition with great rhythmical fluency

10338-1couple4.jpg	The subject of the Ill-Matched Couple was a favourite of the Cranach workshop, more than 40 versions of it is known. (The contemporary name for these pictures was Amorous Pair.) The subject existed as early as the fifteenth century and was chiefly the subject for prints (e.g. the engraving by the Master of the Housebook), but Cranach developed it further in his own way and refined it.

00113-christ.jpg	The fruit and vegetables presented in Aertsen's paintings are peasant foods, but they are a feast for the eyes. His market scenes are not slices of everyday life, but plausible inventions. Many of the fruit and vegetables depicted in his work have sexual connotations and some of them were eaten as aphrodisiacs.In the present painting, the artist juxtaposes the biblical narrative with a market scene, encouraging beholders to ponder the relationship between love and lust, between sexual attraction and visual seduction. The foreground of the painting is filled with sexual innuendoes. On the left side, a man shows a woman his strings of onions. Although this may look innocent and mundane, onions were commonly used as aphrodisiacs. Furthermore, according to proverbial folklore, peeling an onion was like peeling off clothes, for it could easily result in tears. On the right, a man grasps a black rooster, a phallic allusion, in one hand, and an egg basket, a vaginal allusion, in the other
