09374-leaping1.jpg	For some of his large canvases Constable painted full-size oil sketches, The Leaping Horse being an example. Here he has tried to freeze a sudden action - the leap of a barge horse over a cattle barrier on the Stour towpath. But to the modern observer his own description of the picture, written shortly before it was ready for the 1825 Academy exhibition - 'calm &#38; exhilarating, fresh &#38; blowing' - applies more happily to the sketch; the greatest sufferer in the finished canvas is the sky, which has lost its bubbling clouds

34902-11austri.jpg	Christian themes have never wholly excluded animal grotesques, strange hybrid creatures, or winged monsters. In their authentical role as a personification of evil, they form part of God's grand scheme of salvation. This is apparent in the areas framing the apse of St. Jacob in Kastellaz near Tramin in the southern Tyrol. The malicious creatures include centaurs, harpies, fish-like creatures, and dog-headed monsters devouring serpents. Armed with bow and arrow, serpent slings and clumsy bone tools, these grotesque creatures are also engaged in battle with one another

13127-room.jpg	The best of Elinga's paintings can be confused with those of Pieter de Hooch, whom he imitated. But his composition is simpler, his line firmer, his shadows sharper, and, most tellingly, he avoided showing faces, whose depiction was often beyond him. Nevertheless, his works have the typical Delft quietness, and their minimalist details and action mean that today's public can hear all the more clearly the rustle of a broom sweeping a stone floor and immerse themselves in the cozy world of a Dutch house

On the side walls, the preaching and deeds of the Antichrist and the joys of the chosen in paradise (left), the resurrection of the flesh and the tortures of the damned in hell (right) can be seen. In the first bay of the vaulting, painted by Signorelli, are virgins, patriarchs, martyrs, and Church fathers.The side walls are covered with seven large scenes:the Sermon and Deeds of the Antichrist,the Destruction of the World,the Resurrection of the Flesh,the Damned,the Elect,the Paradise,the Hell.The ceiling frescoes (the groups of Apostles, Angels, Patriarchs, Doctors of the Church, Martyrs and Virgins) had been devised by Fra Angelico.

32486-lastjudg.jpg	This large fresco is in the apse of the San Prospero in Reggio Emilia.In the Renaissance period the decoration of the church is frequently focused on the apse and the entrance wall. These terminal walls of extended interior spaces are visible from a great distance, catching visitors' attention. The decoration of the apse towers over the events of mass at the high altar; the decoration of the inside wall of the faï¿½ade serves as an admonition or reinforcement for the visitors as they leave the liturgical ceremony and the church. Large format in both places called for fundamental, weighty themes.Examples of large-scale painted apse recesses are common in the areas ruled by Venice but also in Emilia. A large-scale fresco in the apse vault or on an entrance faï¿½ade could appear to break open the surface of the wall to provide a vision of the heavens or a view of an historical event; alternatively, it could illusionistically extend the existing architecture and enliven it with holy figures. Camillo Procaccini placed a Last Judgment in the semicircular apse of San Prospero in Reggio Emilia, the church of the patron saint of the city. A painted retable with the Lamentation of Christ looms up from below, drawing the viewer in. Above it, and seemingly behind it, the wall opens up onto a powerful vision of the Second Coming of Christ, with Christ as judge, resurrecting the dead and punishing the damned: behind death and sorrow awaits resurrection. The lower section of the painting, with death and resurrection, recedes into the depth with the curve of the wall; the heavenly hosts, by contrast, come out toward the viewer along the vaulting of the apse, as if they were pushing their way into the church

30473-butcher.jpg	The two paintings in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica (The Butcher's Shop an the Fishmonger's Shop) were originally part of a series of four. The dating of the pictures, considered to rank among the best examples of Italian genre painting, oscillates between 1578-80 and 1585-90. There are close stylistic connections between these canvases and the works of the Dutch masters Aertsen and Beuckelaer, as well as with the Butcher's Shop by Annibale Carracci (now at Oxford).Passerotti describes the butcher's shop with a combination of realistic precision in the rendering of details and irony in the characterization of the people. In late sixteenth century art the theme of the butcher shop was moralistically interpreted as an allegorical warning about the temptations of flesh and of indulgence in erotic passions without caution. According to the counter-reformation precepts laid down by Gabriele Paleotti (1582), veiled moral messages could be transmitted through comical pictures.In both pictures the sparrow appears: as this bird's Italian name is the passerotto, the artist used it as a type of pictorial signature

23565-eavesdr.jpg	"Between 1655 and 1657 Maes produced at least six innovative genre scenes with an ""eavesdropper"" as a protagonist. The present painting is possibly the last of these variations on the theme and the largest and most ambitious work in this series. The company in the upstairs room at the left is waiting to be served and the lady of the house, richly clad in a fur-trimmed red velvet jacket, descends the stairs with an empty wine glass in her left hand. She smiles out at the viewer, her finger raised to her lips cautioning for silence. She has spotted her maidservant on a lower level being seduced by a man and thus neglecting her duties.

03630-batavia.jpg	Dutch expansion overseas was in both directions, eastward and westwards. In particular, it was the establishment of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602 and the Dutch West India Company (WIC) in 1621, each with clearly demarcated areas of activity, that caused the number of Dutch overseas territories to increase rapidly. Some of the settlements in the western hemisphere were only briefly under Dutch administration: Northern Brazil (1624-1661) and New Holland, with the city of New Amsterdam &#151; the future New York &#151; at the mouth of the Hudson river (1628-1664). On the other hand, the islands of Curacao, Aruba, Bonaire, St. Eustatius, Saba and St. Martin are still Dutch, while Surinam became independent in 1975.The Far Eastern territories were the most important, including settlements in India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Malacca (now part of Malaysia), Formosa (now Taiwan), the Japanese island of Deshima and the Indonesian archipelago. It was here, in Batavia on the island of Java, that the VOC established its administrative headquarters, with a governor-general in charge from 1610 onwards. Trading contracts were signed and alliances concluded with local princes. In 1652, a staging post for VOC ships was established at the southern tip of Africa, known as the Cape of Good Hope. The arrival of settlers was to transform this into a fully-fledged Dutch colony.In the 17th century a striking number of Dutch artists sought work abroad. Historical research confirmed that they were the most travelled in Europe. However, it is not true that artists (with the exception of the cartographers) travelled in great numbers to distant continents in the wake of the ships of the Dutch East and West India companies. That happened only incidentally.Andries Beeckman painted views of 17th-century Batavia (now Jakarta). His large painting of the Batavia market and fort provides striking evidence of the interest Asia and Asians stimulated in Holland. Much attention has been paid to the central figures in the painting. A man strolls with a woman whose clothing and appearance strongly suggest an Asian ancestry, while a servant holds a payung (parasol, symbol of status in Southeast Asia) above them.In the background of the painting is the castle of Batavia, the bastion of Dutch rule in Asia. This was where the VOC's administrators lived. The governor-general is just arriving in town with his retinue. In the foreground is a market by the Kali Besar, or Great River. The Dutch built Batavia in 1619 on the site of Jakarta, which they had destroyed. Beeckman was commissioned by the VOC to paint this peaceful scene on the spot.Beeckman made two versions of this painting

17226-copies18.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 667, JH 1884.Van Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum at Saint-Rï¿½my in May 1889 as a third-class voluntary patient. In the first weeks of his treatment he did not leave the area of the asylum and he only started to paint outside the walls in June 1889. During the rest of the summer the worsening of his condition did not make it possible for him to work outside, thus in July and August he painted mostly portraits and he copied pictures of his favourite artists, Millet and Delacroix. However, his attention was also caught by the peculiar figures of Daumier.The Drinkers was based on a woodcut after Daumier's original which was entitled The Psychology of Drinkers - the Four Ages. Van Gogh referred to the work only as Drinkers, probably the depicted types of people engaged him more than the allegorical meaning.In his copies, van Gogh did not make any subjects his own, he merely borrowed them. Daumier's Drinkers simply reminded him of his own excesses in Paris and Arles, but once he painted a copy, the picture re-established its intrinsic power and meaning

04794-1christ.jpg	Christ's visit to the house of Martha and Mary, taken from St Luke's Gospel, formed the basis of several representations from the mid-16th century onwards. In the religious context of the time, this scene illustrated one of the fundamental differences opposing Catholics and Protestants. The latter sought salvation in action whilst the former placed greater value on the contemplative life. In his painting Pieter de Bloot combined the religious scene in the background with a kitchen still-life in the foreground, following the tradition established in the sixteenth century by Pieter Aertsen and his nephew and pupil Joachim Beuckelaer

12363-tivoli2.jpg	Not all of Dughet's work falls into the category of Poussin imitation. There is a category of much more naturalistic pictures, which have proved almost impossible to date. They often include views of Tivoli, and also show a preoccupation with the picturesque. The ruined circular temple of Tivoli on top of its very steep slope inspired painters interested in nature at its most romantic, and some of Dughet's best pictures are of this subject, in which the waterfalls trickling over the rocks are painted with great naturalism. A good example of this type of landscape is his painting in the Molinari Pradelli collection in Bologna

10309-04luthe2.jpg	Lucas Cranach appeared in Wittenberg in 1505 as the court artist of Frederick the Wise. Wittenberg, a university town which became the greatest and most authoritative centre for the preparation of the Reformation, favoured Cranach's contacts and relations with men of culture, like Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon.Because the artist too adhered to the Reformation it was only natural that he executed many portraits of Luther. In all Cranach's versions of the famous reformer, the image conveyed is physically faithful, and makes no attempt to conceal the harsh coarseness of Luther's peasant-like head and a certain petit-bourgeois expression.The two portraits of Luther and his wife are recorded still attached together in 1724.

17103-2maries3.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 420, JH 1462.At the end of May 1888 van Gogh took a trip to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, a fishing village on the Mediterranean coast. He painted here two seascapes (F 415 and F 417) and a view of the village (F 416) along with a number of drawings that he based paintings on once he was back in his studio.The Street in Saintes-Maries represents van Gogh's greatest commitment at that date to the principle of autonomous colour. In it he lavishly indulges his fondness for contrasts, unusually using all three varieties in the picture. The contrast of red and green dominates the right of the painting, blue and orange, the left, and yellow and violet, the centre. Van Gogh based the painting on one of the sketches (F 1434) he had hastily made in Saintes-Maries, an affectionate drawing of snug cottages. The colours, detached from any real correlatives, were added subsequently in the studio

04209-dominic.jpg	Bartolomï¿½ de Cï¿½rdenas, known as Bermejo, was a master of detail. In the background of his picture of the Resurrection, now in Barcelona, he depicted in an area of scarcely more than a few square centimetres, a beautiful landscape in which the representation of rocks and foliage is as delicate as anything by Dï¿½rer. But though the effect of light is depicted most exquisitely, there is very little plasticity in the representation of the face of the learned abbot which, in fact, almost merges into the radiance of the golden background. Of paramount importance to Bermejo was the representation of every detail of the embroidered cope, the splendid mitre, the amazingly intricate Gothic carving on the throne (itself almost an architectural feat) and every vein of the marble floor. The total effect of splendour makes the painting seem like a lavishly gilt chalice or a prelate's vestment that have taken several years to embroider rather than an example of the art of painting

26525-4paul1.jpg	The conversion of Saul (St Paul) is the best-known and most widely represented of the Pauline themes (Acts 9:1-9). On the road to Damascus, where he was going to obtain authorization from the synagogue to arrest Christians, Paul was struck to the ground, blinded by a sudden light from heaven. The voice of God, heard also by Paul's attendants, as artists make clear, said, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?' They led him to the city where, the voice had said, he would told what he had to do. According to a tradition, connected with the medieval Custom of representing pride as a falling horseman, Paul made the journey on horseback. He lies on the ground as if just thrown from his horse, prostrate with awe, or unconcious. He may be wearing Roman armour. Christ appeares in the heavens, perhaps with three angels. Paul's attendants run to help him or try to control the rearing horses.In Michelangelo's fresco the composition shows great depth of feeling obtained by the use of light and darkness that foreshadows Rembrandt and testifies to the heroic virtuosity of the aged master. A focal line traverses the the painting, its progression at once reveals the meaning of the composition. Starting at the top left it flows diagonally, along the figure of Christ descending and a beam of light. It follows a figure with raised fingers and another, bent over the fallen Saul, and circumscribes the ellipse of this body. From his right leg it curves back and upward in the direction of a horse galloping in the background, and loses itself in the undulating contours of the mountains with a vision of the heavenly Jerusalem faintly outlined in their folds - unless we accept a more literal explanation and call it Damascus. Note that this line has the shape of a bishop's staff and sums up the whole incident in symbolic form: Saul destined to be shepherd and overseer of people. (The term 'bishop' means overseer.) The high-light on the head of Saul and on the horse's head confirms the symbolic meaning; the dim awarness of fallen man is touched by the lightning flash of grace, and as universal conciousness awakens in him, he loses his animal torpor and gains true knowledge.

12580-4fugger.jpg	"The presence of this portrait is documented, in the eighteenth century, in the gallery of the elector of Bavaria. Because of successive restorations, the top layer of colour is missing.During the Diet of Augsburg, in 1518, Dï¿½rer portrayed Jakob Fugger in a charcoal drawing. The final painting, on canvas, differs from the drawing in the wealthier clothing of the subject, and, above all, in the framing: a half-bust in the drawing, a half-length in the painting.Jakob Fugger of Augsburg (1459-1525), the wealthiest merchant of his day, learned the art of commerce in Venice. He possessed a network of business agencies throughout Europe. His was the most important banking institution in Europe, and he had the monopoly of silver and copper mines. He obtained the right to mint the coins of the Vatican from Julius II, Leo X, and Adrian VI, and he had an important role in the system of tax collection and payment of indulgences from the Vatican coffers. He heavily financed the political and military undertakings of Maximilian I and Charles V: just for the election of the latter, he contributed 300,000 florins. In 1508, Maximilian I conferred him a noble title, and Leo X nominated him Count Palatine of the Lateran. In 1519, he established in Augsburg the ""Fuggerei,"" a small city within the city, consisting of 106 small houses intended for the most needy citizens.The outer edges of his garments and fur coat, crossing and overlapping, create an ascendant pyramid effect, which solidly sets off the portrait. At the same time, his garments sharply contrast with his face, hard and severe, atop a bull neck. Only the clear complexion of the flesh, painted with extremely fine brush strokes, which is detached from a delicate blue background, attenuates his dynamism and severity. The position of the head denotes firmness and self-assurance, and the eyes look away, possibly to indicate a farsightedness. The wide forehead, lined with a simply-fashioned gold beret, and the thin, pressed lips, give him the look of a man who - at least according to Dï¿½rer's interpretation - has a strong personality and no need of decoration to assert himself.This impressive characterization, if somewhat idealized, along with the one of Dï¿½rer's father of 1497 (National Gallery, London), is probably one of the most significant of portraiture in that era in Europe"

38573-interior.jpg	The lute is a plucked string instrument with a fretted neck and a deep round back. The origins of the lute are obscure. Various types of lutes were in use in ancient cultures. The most important point of transfer of the lute from Muslim to Christian European culture might have been in Sicily, where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Saracen musicians. Over the course of the Baroque era the lute was increasingly relegated to the continuo accompaniment, and was eventually superseded in that role by keyboard instruments. The lute fell out of use after 1800.

32951-07folig.jpg	The painting was executed for Sigismondo de' Conti in 1511-12. It represents the Madonna in Glory but it is usually called the Madonna of Foligno.Raphael's pictorial research had been enriched by his solutions regarding the use of light in the Expulsion of Heliodorus and the Liberation of St Peter. These pictorial devices reappear in the Madonna of Foligno, now in the Vatican Museum. The Madonna and Child, borne by a cloud of angels and framed by an orange disk, dominate the group of saints below them, among whom is the donor. This group includes - from left to right - St John the Baptist, St Francis, Sigismondo de' Conti and St Jerome. A small angel at the centre of the composition holds a 'small plaque which was originally intended to carry the dedicatory inscription.The painting was commissioned to commemorate a miracle in which the donor's house in Foligno was struck by lightning or - according to another version - was struck by a projectile during the siege of Foligno, although it was not damaged. The stormy atmosphere of the landscape background and the flash of lightning (or explosion) which strikes the Chigi Palace (visible at left) illustrate the legend. The strong characterization of the figures, the volumetric fullness of the putti and the refined chiaroscuro distinguish the panel (which was taken as loot by Napoleon's army in 1799 and returned in 1815) as a work of the mature artist

22640-07madonn.jpg	The altarpiece comes from the Cappella Medicea del Noviziato in Santa Croce, in Florence. The four saints represented are St Francis, St Damian, St Cosmas and St Anthony of Padua.The work shows traces of dynamism that appears to derive from the contemporary presence of Donatello. Here, Lippi uses a light that is physical and real, and groups the forms in a more classical compositional arrangement. The figures are fairly static, and not unjustly an unexpected angularity in the poses has been noticed, almost a hint of Andrea del Castagno. In the Virgin's plump hands and in the typically newborn proportions of the Child, however, Lippi again reveals, over and above the solemnity of the scene, his openness towards a humanity observed with love and sympathy

11022-501david.jpg	In 1816, David painted the tender portrait of the Comtesse Vilain XIII and her Daughter. The 36-year-old comtesse had formerly been lady-in-waiting to the empress Marie Louise and had held Napoleon's son, the king of Rome, at his christening in 1811. Her husband, Philippe Vilain XIIII, had been the mayor of Ghent and had been raised to the nobility by Napoleon in 1811. (The numerals XIIII after the family name were a reminder of a seventeenth-century ancestor who had presented the keys of Ghent to Louis XIV.) In the picture David gives a very frank yet affectionate portrayal of mother and daughter, although the comtesse complained about being forced to pose for hours on end. The end result was not only faithful and lifelike but also a beautiful piece of work. Like many of his Brussels portraits, the sitters are closely framed, bringing them near to the spectator

07254-canal704.jpg	This work and its companion picture (The Thames and the City of London from Richmond House), have become the most widely admired paintings executed by Canaletto during his stay in England. They were painted for the Duke of Richmond, and probably based upon sketches made from views from the upper windows of his London home, Richmond House. The Duke himself is depicted with a servant in the courtyard at the lower right.Whitehall is shown as an open space surrounded by small buildings, unfamiliar to modern Londoners accustomed to vast government offices covering the area. The Tudor Treasury Gate at the left was demolished in 1759 to ease the flow of traffic, but the Banqueting House, left of centre in the middle-distance, and church of St Martin-in-the-Fields beyond and to the right of it, remain.A sense of order has been imposed on the urban sprall; the main buildings lie parallel to the picture plane, and the perspective is conveniently established by the walls and pathways which run towards the centre of the composition. Everything - from the chickens in the foreground to the houses half a mile away - is observed with a crispness of equal insistence, so creating a vivid record of this unexpected view of the capital during the reign of George II.Canaletto later reinterpreted the scene from a lower viewpoint, and produced an even wider panorama (one of his most spectacular), which includes a view of the Thames at the left

33648-07landsc.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 450.Although Rembrandt used extensive landscape settings in several of his early biblical and, more particularly, mythological pictures, he only took up landscape painting proper for the first time in the late 1630s. (By this term is meant paintings in which the landscape is the main subject, not necessarily paintings without figures.) He probably produced fewer than a dozen landscapes in oils altogether and seems to have given up the practice after 1650. In drawings and etchings, his landscapes formed a higher proportion of the total but these too were confined to the middle twenty years of his career.The Landscape with Buildings illustrated here is perhaps the most monumental of Rembrandt's landscape paintings, even though it is not physically large. It is also the most classical, and may be compared with Annibale Carracci's Landscape with the Flight into Egypt, painted in Rome about 1603, which Rembrandt might have known in a copy. In both paintings, the skyline is dominated by a mixed group of buildings, seen partly in sunshine and partly in shadow. These buildings are so fully integrated with the landscape that they seem almost like extensions of it, as if they were outgrowths of rock rising out of the hillside. The foreground is occupied by a placid river, which in the case of Rembrandt's picture is crossed by a low classical bridge

07195-canal311.jpg	Processions and festivals, ceremonies and regattas - even Gentile Bellini's 15th century paintings bear witness to the brilliant pageantry of La Serenissima. Canaletto not only continues in this tradition, but actually revives it, adding to it his own views and temperament and clothing it in the garb of his own era. Whether he portrays the city's Ascension Day celebrations, the symbolic marriage of Venice with the sea, or the arrival of the Doge: it is no longer with the grand choreography and dignified regularity that dominates Bellini's paintings.Canaletto executed some paintings for the Imperial ambassador to Venice, Count Bolagnos, recording the ceremony of the presentation of his credentials to the doge in 1729. The resulting two paintings, the Reception of the Ambassador in the Doge's Palace and the Bucintoro Returning to the Molo on Ascension Day, are now in private collection. The latter is considered to be one of Canaletto's highest achievements

17771-502goya.jpg	Though it was no doubt painted earlier, the first record of The Clothed Maja and the first mention of the paintings together is in an inventory of Godoy's collection dated 1 January 1808, where they are called 'gipsies'. In an article on Los Caprichos published in Cadiz in 1811, it is as Goya's Venuses that they are mentioned amongst his most admired works (they are also called Venuses in Goya's biography by his son). The next mention of the Majas is towards the end of 1814, when Goya was denounced to the Inquisition for being the author of two obscene paintings in the sequestrated collection of the Chief Minister Godoy, 'one representing a naked woman on a bed...and the other a woman dressed as a maja on a bed'. On 16 May 1815, the artist was summoned to appear before a Tribunal 'to identify them and to declare if they are his works, for what reason he painted them, by whom they were commissioned and what were his intentions'. Unfortunately Goya's declaration has not yet come to light.As a pair of paintings of a single figure in an identical pose, the Majas are a highly original invention. The theory that the clothed woman was intended as a cover for the naked one is very credible. It is not surprising that the Majas attracted the attention of the Inquisition in Madrid in 1814. As late as 1865 Manet's Olympia (which bears such a close resemblance to The Naked Maja that it is difficult to believe that the artist had not seen Goya's painting) created a furious scandal when it was exhibited in the Paris Salon

17111-3arles25.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 454, JH 1562.Van Gogh prepared for Gauguin's visit to Arles by painting a series of canvases to decorate the Yellow House. Out of this project came a sequence of paintings of sunflowers. They are important as a series, and are more than just interior decoration. Firstly, in these paintings van Gogh demonstrated a further aspect of his current studies of colour. They are painted mainly in variations on a single colour: yellow. However, instead of using violet, yellow's complementary, for contrast, he has introduced blue. Rigorous application of theory broke down in the face of a preference for this theoretically arbitrary combination. Its appeal lay in the fact that it had been used by a seventeenth-century Dutch artist much on van Gogh's mind in Arles, Vermeer. Repeatedly van Gogh associated Vermeer with yellow and blue

31508-este.jpg	The first half of the fifteenth century saw the growth and development of portraiture as a genre. Among the artists who practiced portraiture were Jacopo Bellini, Masaccio, Domenico Veneziano, and Pisanello. Pisanello depicts his patron Leonello d'Este, Lord of Ferrara, in profile, giving a characteristic view of the sitter. Pisanello's style was very well suited for this northern Italian court.Leonello d'Este (died 1450) was born into one of the oldest families whose origins date back to the time of Charlemagne in the early 9th century when they settled in Lombardy. The area controlled by the Este family had grown from century to century. They were Lords of Ferrara and its hinterland (Modena and Reggio). In the Quattrocento they earned a reputation as important patrons of the arts and sciences.This painting has been associated with the 1441 competition held between Jacopo Bellini and Pisanello to paint Leonello's likeness. However, recent research makes it unlikely and dates the painting somewhat later, c. 1444

14171-04readin.jpg	Among Fragonard's most innovative compositions are his so-called 'portraits de fantasie,' a series of half-length figures of men and women dressed in fanciful costumes and usually accompanied by attributes or emblems of a profession or activity. The figures are invariable placed behind a ledge, tabletop, or other object that defines the interior space of the picture, and many turn dramatically and are brilliantly lit. Young Girl Reading has always been considered one of the series, although it does not conform precisely to the dominant characteristics of the majority of the others.Few artists can have enjoyed painting more than Fragonard. The way he applied his paint in broad sensuous strokes, which have a life of their own, communicates the artist's pleasure to the spectator.

This painting celebrates their marriage, and the luminosity of the colours and the ebullient presentation of the figures makes this one of Rubens's most magnificent achievements. He has related his marriage to the theme of the Garden of Love; the fountain, the trellis, and the caryatid are symbols of fertility.

24236-rialto.jpg	The Rialto Bridge over the Grand Canal with its galleries of shops has always been a tourist attraction. Up till the middle of the previous century it formed the only permanent link between the two sides of the Canal. The bridge leads from the Campo di San Bartolommeo to the busy Rialto quarter, of old the commercial centre of Venice and nowadays still the site of the market. Between 1588 and 1591, the wooden bridge was replaced by the present stone construction by Antonio da Ponte. Da Ponte's design apparently made a better impression than those of illustrious architects such as Michelangelo, Sansovino and Palladio, whose plans were rejected at an earlier stage of the competition. The bridge is seen here from Palazzo dei Dieci Savi on the Riva del Vin, where wine used to be unloaded. We look in the direction of the Riva del Ferro on the opposite side of the Grand Canal, on the right side of which Palazzo Manin and part of Palazzo Bembo are still just visible.The composition is largely determined by the spectacularly foreshortened bridge on the left and by the Riva del Ferro. The Riva recedes much more here than in reality, so that the veduta seems to be bent backwards, as it were. The rendering of the stairway on the left at the foot of the bridge catches the eye. Our attention is also attracted by the busy activity in the shadowy foreground, a common trait in the work of Carlevaris. The composition is designed so as to lead the eye of the spectator from the left foreground by way of the Rialto Bridge to the right along the other bank.The painting has been attributed to Marieschi since 1958. In the past it was attributed to Canaletto, and later to Bernardo Bellotto.

29654-embankme.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.To develop his skills, De Nittis went to Paris in 1868, settled there and became established. In 1873, through Degas, he met the Impressionists, and had five pictures in their first group exhibition in 1874. He also had more conventional work in the Salon, but his brushwork, composition and technique were steadily coming into line with French Impressionist practice in paintings such as The Victoria Embankment, London or Breakfast in the Garden

07793-05birth.jpg	Carpaccio painted the Stories from the Life of the Virgin between 1504 and 1508 in the Scuola degli Albanesi, consecrated to Mary and to St Gall. This building, which still exists, was constructed around the year 1500 on a piece of land belonging to the monastery of the Augustinian friars at San Maurizio; the confraternity it housed consisted mostly of the community of Illyrians who had settled in Venice in great numbers especially after the Turkish conquest of Scutari in 1479. The six small paintings are today in four different museums: the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo (Birth of the Virgin), the Brera in Milan (Presentation in the Temple and Wedding of the Virgin), the Giorgio Franchetti Gallery in the Ca' d'Oro in Venice (Annunciation and Death of the Virgin) and the Correr Museum in Venice (Visitation).As compared with the earlier, the level of invention and innovation in these works is fairly poor, as is the range and depth of colour; this cannot be explained entirely by the fact that Carpaccio was assisted in this task only by mediocre helpers and that he was less interested in this commission than he had been in the cycle for San Giorgio degli Schiavoni. Carpaccio was quite obviously finding it difficult to develop his art in the climate of spiritual revolution initiated by Giorgione. And yet, in these subjects he occasionally shows a renewed interest in the everyday aspects of existence. Especially in the Birth of the Virgin he investigates with great attention to detail the interior scenes, and every last element of the decoration, recreating a mood of intimacy thanks to a use of soft tints, further mellowed by a diffuse lighting

32800-33cardel.jpg	The Madonna of the Goldfinch, one of Raphael's Florentine panels, was painted by Raphael for the marriage of his friend Lorenzo Nasi and Sandra di Matteo di Giovanni Canigiani. It was severely damaged following the partial collapse of the Nasi house in 1547, as mentioned by Vasari. It was subsequently restored probably by  Michele di Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio (Michele Tosini), a coworker in Ghirlandaio's workshop, who was deeply influenced by Raphael.The Christ Child is lovingly stroking a goldfinch that the boy Baptist has just given him. A symbol of the Passion (the goldfinch, because it feeds among thorns) is thus combined in a scene that can at a first level of meaning be seen simply as children at play.The composition follows that of the Madonna of the Meadow, with the essential difference that the children in the Madonna of the Goldfinch are more firmly united with the central figure of the Virgin. The colour is more lively than that of the Madonna of the Meadow and foreshadows the colourist character of Raphael's Roman paintings. The landscape, and particularly the architectural forms it contains, reflects the influence of Flemish art, even though it is still structured in the Umbrian manner This influence was as alive in Florence as it was in Urbino in the second half of the Quattrocento. It is perhaps most visible in the sloping roofs and tall spires, unusual elements in a Mediterranean landscape. The influence of Michelangelo is again evident in the well structured figure of the infant Christ. It was to become even more evident in the works which followed

11018-412david.jpg	"David did paint Napoleon once more, in 1812, but this commission came from a most unexpected source. Britain and France had been at war since 1803 but such was the emperor's fame that a Scottish aristocrat, Alexander Douglas, later Duke of Hamilton, paid David the enormous sum of 1,000 guineas (18,650 francs) for a full-length portrait. This was not Napoleon the athletic and heroic warrior, but Napoleon the statesman and lawgiver who, as the burnt-down candle and the clock with a time of 4-13 am show, works far into the night for the benefit of his subjects. A scroll of paper in the bureau bears the word 'Code"", which refers to the new Civil Code, actually in operation since 1804 but which was renamed the 'Code Napoleon' in 1807 in an obvious propaganda move to promote him as a legislator. In the portrait the emperor has evidently just stopped work and, as the sword on the chair indicates, now prepares to review the troops wearing the uniform of a colonel of the Foot Grenadier Guards.Although he did not pay for it, Napoleon liked the picture and said: 'You have found me out, dear David; at night I work for my subjects' happiness, and by day I work for their glory.'"

19245-stillif4.jpg	In 1626 van der Hamen made his still-lifes more varied and complex than his early ones by placing objects on different levels. This type of composition seems to have originated in Rome during the early 1620s and is seen in works attributed to Tomasso Salini and Agostino Verrocchi. However, van der Hamen's use of this scheme differs from that of the Roman painters, who liked to scatter a profusion of  inanimate objects over the surface. Van der Hamen drastically reduces the number of elements and arranges the remainder into exquisitely balanced, asymmetrical compositions, strongly lit in the Spanish manner. This allows him to concentrate on the rendering of each individual object and thus to enhance the sensation of corporeality and texture

18345-1410grec.jpg	The sitter is usually identified as Cardinal Don Fernando Ni&#241;o de Guevera (1541-1609), Grand Inquisitor and, from 1601, Archbishop of Seville. The painting was executed c. 1600, when Inquisitor-General, and certainly before he became Archbishop of Seville. He is one of a number of eminent ecclesiastics of Toledo portrayed by El Greco, and it is one of his finest portraits. The splendour and richness of colour is appropriate to the character and rank of the sitter. The frontal turn of the pose concentrates attention on the figure. El Greco suggests the cardinal's personality through the emphasis on his prominent glasses, the compulsive gesture of his left hand, the animated, nervous brushwork, and the singular colour range. The painting is signed on the creased paper on the floor.This celebrated picture - a landmark in the history of European portraiture - has become synonymous not only with El Greco but with Spain and the Spanish Inquisition

14083-charles.jpg	"The king is painted between drawn curtains. His thin, ascetic face, melancholy eyes and puritan simplicity are evidence of the profound psychological penetration of the painter and the economy of the means used to express it. The blue hat is adorned with a V-shaped gold pattern; and this is practically the only trace of pomp in the painting. His simple dark red velvet doublet is bordered with brown fur at the neck and cuffs. The rather sad, somewhat timid face, the eyes narrow, the nose long, the lips thick, looks as if carved by a sculptor's chisel. The artist has painted the king in three-quarters profile and nothing but the inscription ""le trï¿½s victorieux roy de France"" betrays that this was the ruler who brought the Hundred Years' War to a triumphant end. It is possible that the Touraine artist may have painted this portrait immediately after his return from his journey to Italy, so much discussed by scholars, for it is the most mediaeval in spirit of his portraits"

It is difficult to determine that some of the more careful drawings worked out down to the smallest details should be thought of as merely study material for the use of the workshop or whether they are the work of later artists.

35469-07mythol.jpg	"At the height of his glory, Rubens attracted an influx of commissions so great that no one man could possibly satisfy it. Consequently he set about organising a sort of picture factory to meet demand. This was standard practice at the time. When Otto Sperling, the Danish doctor, visited the studio in 1621, he saw ""a large hall without windows, lit only by a large skylight. There were many young painters there, working on different canvases, for each of which Rubens had made chalk drawings, here and there adding indications as to colour. These he later finished himself, and they then passed for works by Rubens.""This proceeding has presented art historians with inextricable problems. But Rubens did not mislead his customers: he specified who had worked on what, and adjusted prices to reflect the degree of his own involvement. His collaborators could, in any case, scarcely be described as pupils. He chose them among the best artists of his time, each according to his speciality: one for flowers, another for animals, another again for landscape. They included the landscape artist Jan Wilden and the animal-painters Paul de Vos and Frans Snyders. The Olympian eagle devouring the liver of Rubens' Prometheus Bound was painted by Frans Snyders."

17810-714goya.jpg	Painted at the same time as The Second of May, Goya here represents another of the 'most notable and heroic actions...of our glorious insurrection against the tyrant of Europe' by a dramatic execution scene. The insurrection of the people of Madrid against the Napoleonic army was savagely punished by arrests and executions continuing throughout the night of 2 May and the following morning. There is a legend that Goya witnessed the executions on the hill of Prï¿½ncipe Pï¿½o, on the outskirts of Madrid, from the window of his house and that, enraged by what he had seen, he went to visit the spot immediately afterwards and made sketches of the corpses by the light of a lantern.Whether Goya saw for himself or knew them by hearsay only, the military executions of civilians is a theme that evidently impressed him deeply. He represented it in several etchings of Los Desastres de la Guerra and in some small paintings as well as in this monumental picture. Here the drama is enacted against a barren hill beneath a night sky. The light of an enormous lantern on the ground between the victims and their executioners picks out the white shirt of the terrified kneeling figure with outstretched arms. The postures, gestures and expressions of the madrilenos and the closed impersonal line of the backs of the soldiers facing them with levelled muskets, emphasize the horror of the scene. The dramatic qualities of this composition, with its pity for the execution of the anonymous victims and its celebration of their heroism, inspired Manet's several versions of the Execution of Maximilian

07179-canal223.jpg	The painting forms part of a series of six views of the Piazza San Marco and the Piazzetta, commissioned by Canaletto's most important patron, Consul Joseph Smith. The series was the first commission that Smith gave Canaletto and is fairly early in date, pre-1730. The scale of the six paintings is large and the style notable for the bold treatment of the light; the free handling of the figures, and the dramatic viewpoint. Presumably Smith ordered the paintings for a specific room in the Palazzo Mangilli-Valmarana on the Grand Canal where he lived, but exactly how they were displayed is not known. The collection formed by Consul Smith was sold to George III in 1762.The buildings in this view of the Piazzetta can be readily identified. The Biblioteca Marciana designed by Jacopo Sansovino is on the left with the Campanile and Loggetta visible immediately behind. Across the Piazza is the Torre dell'Orologio with the east end of the Procuratie Vecchie extending to the left and the beginning of the Campo San Basso to the right. The faï¿½ade of the Basilica di San Marco dominates the right side of the picture together with the column of San Teodoro. The figure in red, gesticulating in the foreground just to the left of centre, is a Procurator who appears to be attended by a secretary or notary. Once the buildings are identified, the degree to which Canaletto has conflated two separate viewpoints and altered the proportions in order to achieve a unified composition becomes apparent. Thus, the height of the Campanile is exaggerated and the projected distance between the viewer and the Torre dell'Orologio lengthened. Other changes include the positioning of the flagpoles and the column of San Teodoro. Most of these topographical adjustments (but not the positioning of the flagpoles) are apparent in the preparatory drawing (Royal Library, Windsor Castle), which may have been made by the artist for discussion with his patron

08668-01soap_b.jpg	Chardin's career started with a large and untypical, dramatic, genre scene known to the Goncourt brothers but destroyed at the Commune - which showed a barber-surgeon aiding a man wounded in a duel. It had been painted for a barber-surgeon, to serve as a signboard outside his premises, and it is thus comparable to the 'enseigne' which Watteau had painted for Gersaint. There Watteau had at last brought his people in from countryfied open-air settings and collected them in an urban environment. Chardin began with a Parisian street scene, but his later genre pictures carry us indoors into much more intimate, and less animated, scenes.In these scenes, although other figures can be visible in the background, the first impression is of a single figure, on which the eye concentrates even while this figure concentrates on a task. Such concentration is typical of Chardin; even when the subject is a boy idly building a card house, or blowing bubbles, there is an intentness that lifts the trivial pastime into an occupation. Unlike Greuze, Chardin never allows his people to ogle the spectator, to act the housemaid or village girl; they are absorbed, absorbed almost literally in the wonderful paint surface which seems to express integrity by the very oil medium

13628-05ferenc.jpg	"When Istvï¿½n Genthon was writing a study on Kï¿½roly Ferenczy's portraits, he considered all his portraits (81 out of 351 pictures) which constitute a significant part of his oevre as far as quality is concerned, although he is not counted as a portrait painter. Ferenczy, a master of biblical compositions and bright landscapes, attempted to realize artistic objectives in portraits, too. He often raised the individual to the level of the general, yet his objectivity and realism opposing reconsideration always produced genuine character portrayals. Ferenczy's ""Self Portrait"" painted in Munich ranks high among his portraits and other pictures.  Ferenczy refers to the relationship between man and nature in an intimate way. His portrait is not the portrait of a painter in the usual sense. The artist is not painted in front of a work which he has been working on in his studio or in the middle of props typical of his profession. Ferenczy's face, open, young and serious,  flashes up in the foreground of dark leaves of a forest. His clothes and face vaguely reflect the light glimmering through branches. The painter in a dark jacket is not posing for the portrait. The brush gently follows the face and soft lines of the hair"

33995-7cappell.jpg	On the inner faï¿½ade above the door the multifigured scene of Mary's birth is painted. It is a visual and iconographic counterpart to the altarpiece, the Annunciation, an oil painting by Reni.The picture is structured into foreground, middle distance, and background. The dominant impression is one of bustling familiarity in the women's chamber. The influence of Dï¿½rer's woodcut is apparent inn the layout of the picture and the design of St Anne's bed in the background. However, borrowings from Ghirlandaio's Mary cycle are also apparent.

19058-rambler.jpg	1890s Impressionist art in Boston was primarily concerned with figure painting, and focused on society ladies in appropriate settings. Edmund Tarbell was one of the first to take this direction. His compositions of the 1890s, showing stylish ladies at leisure out of doors. The choice of theme was mainly responsible for Tarbell's popularity with affluent collectors in Boston. His influence and reputation were also consolidated by years of teaching at the Boston Museum School. People even talked of Tarbellites - that is other Bostonian figure painters whose technique and approach to their subject-matter betrayed an affinity with his presiding spirit.Philip Leslie Hale was seen as one of the Tarbellites. Though he was not one of The Ten, he was closely associated with its member. He bought to Boston figure painting an idiosyncratic variant of the genre that betrayed the influence of Neo-Impressionism. More than his American contemporaries, he tended to dissolve the outlines of white-clad figures, merging them into their settings through a hazy mesh of delicate, pale colours, for preference yellow - as in The Crimson Rambler

23379-03gloves.jpg	This work has always been regarded as one of the finest of Lotto's portraits for its subtly nuanced expression of the sitter's face, and for the quality of the execution.It is assumed that the sitter was Liberale da Pinedel (1495-1548), and the portrait was executed at Treviso. Pinedel's family was originally from San Stefano di Pinidello near Ceneda, but had settled in Treviso in the fourteenth century. The family was originally employed as barrel-makers, but by the mid-sixteenth century it was closely associated with the legal profession, and in 1593 it was admitted to the ranks of the local nobility. Pinedel is portrayed wearing an expensive costume, with the few but telling accessories of a gentleman: gold chain, heavy gold ring, embroidered white handkerchief, and gloves.The compositional formula resembles that evolved by Titian for his own aristocratic portraits

26549-1chapel1.jpg	"The chapel was built between 1475 and 1483, in the time of Pope Sixtus IV della Rovere. A basic feature of the chapel itself, so obvious that it is sometimes ignored, is the papal function, as the pope's chapel and the location of the elections of new popes. Furthermore, the building was in some respects a personal monument to the Della Rovere family, since Sixtus IV saw to its actual construction and the frescoes beneath the vaults, and his nephew Julius II commissioned the ceiling decoration. Oak leaves and acorns abound, heraldic symbols of the family whose name means literally ""from the oak.""The Chapel is rectangular in shape and measures 40,93 meters long by 13,41 meters wide, i.e. the exact dimensions of the Temple of Solomon, as given in the Old Testament. It is 20,70 meters high and is surmounted by a shallow barrel vault with six tall windows cut into the long sides, forming a series of pendentives between them. A marble mosaic floor of exquisite workmanship describes the processional itinerary up to and beyond the marble screen, to the innermost space, where it offers a surround for the papal throne and the cardinals' seats. The architectural plans were made by Baccio Pontelli and the construction was supervised by Giovanino de'Dolci. The walls are divided into three orders by horizontal cornices; according to the decorative program, the lower of the three orders was to be painted with fictive ""tapestries,"" the central one with two facing cycles - one relating the life of Moses (left wall) and the other the Life of Christ (right wall), starting from the end wall, where the altar fresco, painted by Perugino,  depicted the Virgin of the Assumption, to whom the chapel was dedicated. The upper order is endowed with pilasters that support the pendentives of the vault. Above the upper cornice are situated the lunettes. Between each window below the lunettes, in fictive niches, run images of the first popes - from Peter to Marcellus - who practiced their ministry in times of great persecution and were martyred.The wall paintings were executed by Pietro Perugino, Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Cosimo Rosselli, Luca Signorelli and their respective workshops, which included Pinturicchio, Piero di Cosimo and Bartolomeo della Gatta. The ceiling was frescoed by Piero Matteo d'Amelia with a star-spangled sky.Michelangelo was commissioned by Pope Julius II della Rovere in 1508 to repaint the ceiling; the work was completed between 1508 and 1512. He painted the Last Judgment over the altar, between 1535 and 1541, being commissioned by Pope Paul III Farnese"

39631-3emmaus.jpg	The painting's first owners were the Maffei family from Verona, where Titian painted an altarpiece for the Cathedral, and its sonorous gravity and the way the colours traverse the spectrum like a progression of organ chords may take its tone from nearby Brescia, especially the art of Moretto. Indeed, Titian may have borrowed the striking orange-yellow of the page's costume from the similarly placed disciple in Moretto's own Supper at Emmaus of around 1526, which originally hung in the Church of St Luke in Brescia and now in the Tosio-Martinengo Museum. The disciple in green leaning back is modeled on the Judas in Leonardo's Last Supper. The realism of the still-life is also somewhat in the Lombard taste and anticipates not only Caravaggio but also the sacramental realism of Zurbaran

42337-the_farm.jpg	Adriaen van de Velde, who was more versatile than Philips Wouwerman, also painted small landscapes in which animals and figures play an important role. Bode rightly wrote of the 'Sunday atmosphere' (Sonntagsstimmung) of his pictures of the Dutch countryside, and of the precious holiday peace that spreads over his meadows, seen in the bright sparkle of sunny days softened by the haze of the nearby sea.Adriaen was the younger brother of the well known marine painter Willem van de Velde the Younger; they probably were pupils of their father, the marine painter Willem van de Velde the Elder. Adriaen also is said to have studied with Wijnants at Haarlem, but the influence of Wouwerman and Potter is more evident in his early works. Houbraken reports that 'He zealously drew and painted cows, bulls, sheep and landscapes' and adds 'he daily carried his equipment out to the countryside - a practice he continued until the end of his life.' Although many of Adriaen's drawings survive, only a handful made on his excursions to the countryside have been identified; the finest, now at the Amsterdam Historical Museum, served as the basis for his magnificent Farm at Berlin.Adriaen also made numerous drawings of clothed and nude models in his studio; many have been identified as preparatory studies for figures in his landscapes and subject pictures

08816-harvest.jpg	The mid-nineteenth century in Italy was the period of the Risorgimento, the movement that culminated in Italian unification. That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli. This group of landscape, portrait and genre painters, flourishing from about 1850 to 1880, was based on Florence. The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger. There were some other artists associated with the group to varying extent, such as Guglielmo Ciardi, Giuseppe de Nittis, Federigo Zandomeneghi, and Giovanni Boldini. The last-named three all took their bearings from France, and eventually moved to Paris.In the late 1870s, the Florence Macchiaioli seemed to be running out of steam. The older views were now superseded by a more Impressionist strain. In the second generation of Macchiaioli, Ciardi deserves mention. His landscapes expressed a profound response to Nature. He had studied at the Venice Academy, but at the end of the 1870s he moved to Florence, where he had made contact with the Macchiaioli. His structural reliance on effects of light and dark, and his meticulously separated colour zones, constituted and affinity with the group, but he became acquainted also with the art of the Barbizon painters and of the Neapolitan School. Canvases such as Harvest, flooded with light, rendered atmospheric landscapes in a style drawn from Venetian tradition. These and his views of Venice brought Ciardi great success in his lifetime

03894-182jerom.jpg	The painting contains an abrased and somewhat unclear inscription on the first stone at bottom left: S MCCCCCV. It is now accepted as an autograph and resolved as: IOANNES BELLINUS MCCCCCV. But this datation creates not inconsiderable problems, since it is clear that the style is the one Bellini used not later than 1490. Various theories have been advanced, from the proposal to separate the figure from the landscape, attributing them thus to different hands (Bellini and Basaiti, Bellini and workshop), to that of a different interpretation of the date or to the later completition of the painting most of which was executed a long time before. All things considered, the attribution to Bellini now seeming beyond doubt the latter view seems the most likely.An intervention by the workshop, if it existed, did not go further than some parts of the landscape, like the part with the ruins above left, which does appear stiff and rather heavy. The landscape is laden with the usual symbols and religious metaphores which Bellini was very careful about (the fig-tree, the withered tree, the ivy, the layered, agglomerated, crumbling rocks, etc.). However, in the very clear landscape view all these elements, affectionately and lyrically portrayed one by one, have not yet found the sublime harmony that was typical of the backgrounds which Bellini painted after 1500, and appear here more like a kind of splendid naturalistic compilation

She is holding her attribute, a tower, and in contrast to the two other saints is looking directly to us.Because she was so beautiful, Barbara's pagan father locked her in a tower. She converted to Christianity, and against his wishes built in her tower a chapel, its three windows symbolizing of the Trinity. Enraged, her father had her beheaded.

17507-16virgin.jpg	In this tightly cropped composition, in which the head of the Child is too large for his small, muscular body, the two figures are framed in the middle ground by a curious architectural mixture of asymmetrical marble columns before gray stone pilasters in an unidentifiable palace room.The painting belongs to a group of such Virgin and Child types that appears to date late in Gossart's career from about 1525-30. In addition to the present example in an English private collection, these include the Virgin and Child paintings in Cleveland, Berlin and Bilbao, the latter being the most mannered. Gossart's move toward an even more Mannerist mode, both in the poses of his figures and in the quirky nature of his architectural backdrops, seems to have found popularity among his clients

08970-tobacco.jpg	A jug and glass of wine, a snuffbox, pipes, spills, and coals smoldering in a small brazier - these attributes of the vices of smoking and drunkenness constitute a variant of the 'vanitas,' a still-life reminding the viewer of the transience of earthly life. Claesz. supplements the traditional subgenre with an element that increases the eloquence of the didactic message: the banality of the objects that accompany us on the short journey from birth to death			
06336-22other.jpg	Storm at Sea is one of Bruegel's last paintings. It is unfinished and, like so many of his works, defies unambiguous interpretation. On the one hand, we see ships threatened by a storm - man not as master of Nature, in other words, but as its victim. On the other hand, the sailors have poured oil onto the water to calm the sea, and have sacrificed a barrel from their cargo to distract the mighty whale. Yet the barrel could be interpreted that animals - meaning mankind - allow themselves to be distracted by something of little importance, instead of pursuing that which really matters

33446-10oldtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 497.Late in the 1640s Rembrandt began to watch Jews more carefully, and to characterize them more deeply than before. Rembrandt had the opportunity to study the Jewish population of Amsterdam. From the time he purchased his large house in the Sint-Anthonisbreestraat (later the Jodenbreestraat) in 1639 until he was forced to sell it in 1658 he lived on the edge of the largest Jewish community in Holland. Among his Jewish acquaintances were the distinguished rabbi, author, and printer Menasseh ben Israel and the physician Ephraim Bonus; he made portraits of Bonus and perhaps one of Menasseh too. Menasseh, who lived near Rembrandt, commissioned the artist to illustrate one of his own books and he most probably provided him with the form of the cryptic Aramaic Menetekel inscription from the Book of Daniel that appears on the wall in his spectacularly dramatic Belshazzar's Feast.The scene illustrates chapter 5 of the Old Testament Book of Daniel. Belshazzar, King of Babylon, gave a great feast at which wine was drunk in the golden and silver vessels looted by his father Nebuchadnezzar, from the temple in Jerusalem, and 'gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone...which see not, nor hear, nor know' were praised while God himself was not glorified. And there 'came forth fingers of a man's hand and wrote...upon the plaster of the wall'. Only the Jewish seer Daniel was able to read the supernatural inscription MENE TEKEL UPHARSIN which foretold the defeat - in fact, the death - of Belshazzar that same night and the partition of his kingdom among the Medes and the Persians.Rembrandt's intense familiary with the physiognomies of the Spanish Jews (the Sephardim) and the Eastern Jews (the Ashkenazim), who were allowed to live in Amsterdam in relative freedom during the seventeenth century, helped him to enrich his biblical representations. His interest in them was not merely a romantic and pictorial one. To Rembrandt the Jews were the people of the Bible, and with his deepening realism he wanted to become more authentic in his biblical representations. He found among them inspiration for mildly passive and emotional characters, and he also studied the harder and more intellectual types, who show the perseverance of the Jews and furnished models for his figures of the Pharisees. Even more remarkable is the series of portraits of Jesus made around the same time which are based on a Jewish model. Rembrandt, it seems, was the first artist to derive his Christ-type from a personal study of Jews.

20017-birds_sp.jpg	The picture is signed upper left on wall: M. d'Hondecoeter.The artist was born in Utrecht and lived for a short time in The Hague before settling permanently in Amsterdam in 1663. He was trained by his father, Gysbert de Hondecoeter, and by his uncle, Jan Baptist Weenix, who had spent three years in Italy during the 1640s. Melchior de Hondecoeter specialised, like his father, in painting animal and bird pictures, but the backgrounds, usually comprising imaginary landscapes, are more influenced by Weenix. Fidelity to subject matter perhaps accounts for the lack of development in his style, and dated works only occur after 1668, so that it is difficult to suggest a specific chronology for the undated items that abound in his oeuvre. Hondecoeter frequently repeated animals and poses in several pictures and it is apparent, therefore, that he relied upon a pattern book of motifs. His paintings proved to be popular with contemporaries as part of decorative schemes in country houses, and by extension this accounts for his popularity in eighteenth-century England.The foreground is dominated by a fighting cock, a tortoise, a crowned crane, a white hen with chickens and a barking spaniel. In the middle distance are a hoopoe on the left, a domesticated flying pigeon in the centre and a cassowary just to the right of centre. Behind them can be seen a peacock, a peahen and two flamingos. Hondecoeter often showed animals entering the composition from outside the picture space in the manner of the fighting cock on the left. Most of the birds and animals recur in other pictures by the artist, but the high quality of the painting throughout, the vivid colouring and the convincing sense of movement do not suggest any intervention by studio assistants

22951-15scene.jpg	Longhi's amusing genre scenes allows us to form an impression of the fashion, habits, and general half-real, half-fantastic atmosphere of 18th-century Venice, which had lost its political might and turned into a city of amusements, spectacles, and gambling.

Collection Suermondt, 1874.In this painting, along with Woman in Blue Reading a Letter and Woman Holding a Balance, Vermeer attempted a composition in which he showed a single woman concentrating on some kind of occupation. In each case, the woman is shown turning inward with her thoughts, and using some minor physical activity to give herself some countenance. In this case, she gazes into a mirror while holding two yellow ribbons attached to a pearl necklace around her neck. The distance between the solitary figure to the right and the mirror on the wall, next to the window to the left, is filled by a heavy table slightly to the fore. This part of the painting is very dark, with nothing more than a Chinese vase and a rug irregularly covering the table to occupy the space.The light falling in from the left, dispersed by the creamy bare wall, illuminates the meditative young woman admiring her reflection in the distant mirror.In this instance, as well as in the above mentioned two, all emblematic explanations or identifications, such as truth, prudence, or others, do not apply.

04204-christ_l.jpg	"One of the leading Spanish artists of the last third of the fifteenth century was Bartolomï¿½ Bermejo. The signature ""Bartolomeus Vermeio Cordubensis"" on the Piet&#224; in Barcelona cathedral, one of his later works, completed in 1490, indicates that he was born in Cordova. At the same time, there is nothing in the Andalusian art of that period to explain the origin of his style or the source of his technique. We believe that Bermejo must have studied in Flanders, perhaps in direct contact with Dirk Bouts (1420-75), with whom he has certain stylistic affinities. In spite of this Flemish training, Bermejo's work leaves us in no doubt concerning his Spanish origin.

39660-08crucif.jpg	The painting was commissioned for the San Domenico in Ascona by the Cornovi family, who had recently moved to Ancona from Venice.Though this was painted only a little later than the superb Crucifixion in the Escorial, there are already clear signs that Titian's style has progressed to the point where he is painting purely with colour. The scene with the mourners is taking place only in the foreground. The sky and the figures under the Cross are all painted in dark colours. Blue and black dominate the scene; white is used to produce dramatic highlights. Titian succeeds in representing St Dominic's sorrow as he embraces the Cross almost entirely by means of the distribution of light and the broad sweeping brushstrokes.The stark placement of the three mourners in the immediate foreground, inviting us to share their suffering, makes this one of the first masterpieces of Counter-Reformation art, where narrative clarity and emotional empathy were denoted as artistic priorities. The Virgin and saints are arranged in a crescent, like the head of an anchor, at the base of the cross. On the left, the Virgin sways in solitary grief, while in the centre St Dominic, with exaggeratedly long fingers, feverishly clutches the base of the cross to draw strength. Christ, more fully illuminated than the others, is already beyond their reach, an effect Titian achieves by making him a little smaller than the rest and so creating a feeling of distance and separation. The blood which is pointedly depicted coursing along the sinews of his arms and down his side to soak into the loincloth also conforms to the taste and tenets of the Counter-Reformation

36772-magdalen.jpg	Scorel travelled all over Germany, and into Italy, went to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage, arrived back in Venice in 1521, made his fortune by being in Rome at the right moment to be practically the only artist patronized by the Dutch pope Hadrian VI, came back to Utrecht full of the influences of Giorgione, Palma Vecchio, Raphael and Michelangelo, and later went to France.Scorel was the first Renaissance artist in the Netherlands. He depicted Mary Magdalen as a Venetian courtesan seen through the eyes of a Netherlandish artist who had mastered the imitation of materials. He placed her in the mountains of southern France to which the converted prostitute supposedly retreated in later life.

32143-restherd.jpg	Paulus Potter's singular contribution to Dutch 17th-century art was that he painted portraits of animals, making them the focus of his pictures, rather than as a backdrop for human action. His career spanned only twelve years, from which barely four dozen pictures, most of them painted between 1646 and 1653, have come down to us, and his early death in his thirtieth year robbed Dutch painting of one of its greatest talents.

31748-11figure.jpg	The works that Pissarro painted between 1885 and 1892 show us the artist's concern that Impressionism should welcome and absorb something that might give it the permanence of a style. Apple Pickers can be seen not simply as a further reflection by the artist on a subject he had painted several times over the course of his career but also as an experimental synthesis of the different manners then characterising all that was modern in art

37203-1madonna.jpg	The Madonna and Child, no. 583 in the Siena Pinacoteca, after a variety of attributions is now accepted as the earliest known painting by Simone. It was the central panel of a polypytch (on either side there are holes to fasten the side panels to it) and the attribution is based on stylistic considerations: on the one hand, close ties to Duccio's painting; on the other, typical features of Simone's art.The Madonna is looking at the spectator: her erect position, the cloak enveloping her body, her sweet but sad eyes, are all elements typical of Duccio's art. But alongside these we find some totally new features: the sculptural quality of the veil around the Virgin's face and the play of light and shadow; the restless movements of the Child, who turns his head towards the Saint to his left (the figure originally depicted on the side panel) and holds onto his mother's hand; his round body, his mouth, his curly hair and the perfect shape of his ear are all given exact volumes and concrete forms

39816-14venier.jpg	Francesco Venier (1490-1556) was elected Doge on 11 June 1554. He reigned for scarcely two years, until 2 June 1556.

Only in the garment is there a fine play of golden hues, underlining the delicacy of the frail Doge. So far there has been no explanation for the fire in the lagoon, which is visible through the window. In terms of colour, the fire provides an important contrast with the blue sky

06399-30rebel.jpg	"Bruegel painted this picture when he was still living in Antwerp and supplying drawings to the engraver Hieronymus Cock. Turning his back on the then-dominant Italian models, he plunges into the then old-fashioned tradition of Hieronymus Bosch's world. An apparently inextricable mixture of persons and shapes offers itself to our bewildered gaze. Emerging from distant depths in a halo of light, monsters are thrown to earth as from a breaking wave. Angels combat them, led by St Michael, thin as a rake in his golden armour, striking with his sword at the dragon with the seven crowned heads on which he has his foothold.The combat of the archangel with the fallen angels is described in the Book of Revelation (12, 3-9) and was frequently illustrated from the Middle Ages onwards. In Bruegel's rendering, the violence is expressed not in the bitter nature of the battle - indeed St Michael and his sparse troops do not appear particularly threatened by the demons - but by the intensity of the fall - infernal and endless - of this crawling, hideous multitude that invades the entire surface of the picture, in a remarkable unity of action which increases its impact. By borrowing minutiously observed elements from the plant, animal, mineral and human worlds and combining them to form hybrid, deformed beings, Bruegel invents creatures that are the most repulsive, but also the most curious and fantastic imaginable. Mussel shells grafted onto a gigantic shrimp, a human head with butterfly wings attached to a shapeless, bloated body, a puffy gnome carrying a sundial and with a plumed helmet on his head, viscous fish with arms, lizard scales, crustacean paws... a seemingly endless list. Within the ""m&#234;lï¿½e"", every element is differentiated by the scrupulous rendering of the textures. With their long, refined silhouettes, St Michael's allies, elegantly garbed in delicate, luminously coloured albs, are automatically on the side of the Good, in a state of grace that enables them to dominate effortlessly the monstrous hordes, moving around in a clear and azure sky which is in profound contrast with the darkness reserved for the rebels.Bruegel reveals himself here to be a marvellous colourist, dexterously distributing accents of red, green, blue and white and alternating the dark browns and lighter beige ochres with brio"

43311-triptych.jpg	One of the important works of the Bolognese Trecento, the panel - originally part of a triptych - was executed for the small Oratorio della Madonna dei Denti near Mezzarate.The lively nature of the Bolognese paintings of the fourteenth century is easily perceived in the narrative scenes of fresco cycles (nearly all of which, however, are in a poor state of conservation) and in the illuminated miniatures. Vitale managed to convey this nature in his images, not through the action, but through the looks and gestures of his characters.

44344-hounds.jpg	Dog portraiture began in France at the court of Louis XV, who commissioned portraits of his favourite houndshunting scenes of Frans Snyders. In England, where the emphasis in hunting was increasingly being placed upon the performance of individual hounds, which led to intense rivalry among the landed elite, this was reflected in the paintings of John Wootton and Peter Tillemans; the former of whom in particular started to produce portraits of dogs in the mid eighteenth century. Fine examples of Wootton's work in this manner include the mock heroic portrait of Horace Walpole&#146;s favourite dog Patapan, painted in 1743. However, it was Stubbs, a generation later, who really developed the genre, working, as he was, at a time when dogs were becoming increasingly valued not only as sporting trophies, but as objects of interest in themselves. By the late eighteenth century, the dog had gained a new status as a prized possession within English households which it had not formerly enjoyed. Stubbs's highly sensitive paintings of these animals are executed with infinite attention to detail and are possessed with boundless character and charm. Whilst they are seldom uninteresting as paintings, at their best they are small masterpieces

23450-holy_fam.jpg	Leonardo worked in Milan for about twenty years and decisively influenced the development of the Lombard School of painting. Apart from Boltraffio, Bernardino Luini, a native of the Lake Maggiore region, was the most significant and certainly the most prolific of his followers. Luini painted frescoes and altarpieces for the churches and monastic orders of Lombardy, continually repeating types and compositions created by Leonardo and making use of his master's technique of soft modelling by means of light and shade and his gentle, lyrical approach.Luini's female figures are delicate and charming, witness the graceful Mary of the Prado picture, and there is a soft continuity of line. His colours are warm and richly tinted and the tender, oval faces, the finely drawn hands and the singular suppleness and rhythm of the movements lend a rare beauty and poetry to his works

07567-45death0.jpg	This, the largest picture that Caravaggio had yet produced, did not end up in the place for which it was made. In 1602 a papal legal adviser, Laerzio Cherubini, commissioned a Death of the Virgin for the Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala in Trastevere; it was to be finished by 1603. When they saw it, the friars found it alarming, because the Madonna was modelled on a prostitute with whom Caravaggio was in love (according to Mancini), because her legs were exposed (Baglione), because her swollen body was too realistic (Bellori) - for whichever reason, they felt prompted to reject it. After Caravaggio had left Rome, Rubens urged his master, the Duke of Mantua, to buy it. Along with the rest of the movable Gonzaga collection it was bought by Charles I of England and, after he had been executed, was sold to Louis XIV. What the friars could not endure was favoured at court.The painting is severe, sad and still. Under a red canopy hanging from a barely visible ceiling, the disciples are grouped round the corpse (fixed on a bed in rigor mortis), most standing to the left. Light coming from a window high on the left picks out their foreheads and bald pates, before falling on the upper part of the Virgin's body. Above her stands the young, mourning St John the Evangelist who had been given special charge of her; in front, the seated Mary Magdalene stoops forward and almost buries her head in her lap.In the predominant colours - red, orange, dark green - Caravaggio uses a slightly wider range than in his later, darker Roman paintings, but nowhere else did he achieve a mood of such overwhelming solemnity. Mary's companions, her Son's followers, are struck dumb by their grief, like relief sculptures on antique tombs. There is no suggestion that their sorrow will be turned into joy or that Mary will be assumed into heaven

The wily Juno talked her husband into giving her the fine-looking animal and had the hundred-eyed Argus guard it. Jupiter gave Mercury the task of killing the wicked guard.

26671-00_1pe1.jpg	Judith was a patriotic heroine and a symbol of the Jews' struggle against their ancient oppressors in the near east. She is usually shown holding the head of Holofernes, the Assyrian general, whom she has decapitated with a sword.The Assyrian army had laid siege to the Jewish city of Bethulia. When the inhabitants were on the point of capitulating, Judith, a rich and beautiful widow, devised a scheme to save them. She adorned herself 'so as to catch the eye of any man who might see her' (O.T. Apocrypha 10:5), and set off with her maid into the Assyrian lines. By the pretence of having deserted her people she gained access to the enemy commander, Holofernes, and proposed to him a fictitious scheme for overcoming the Jews. After she had been several days in the camp Holofernes became enamoured of her and planned a banquet to which she was invited. When it was over and they were alone together he had meant to seduce her, but he was by then overcome with liquor. This was Judith's opportunity. She quickly seized his sword and with two swift blows severed his head. Her maid was ready with a sack into which they put the head. They then made their way through the camp and back to Bethulia before the deed was discovered. The news threw the Assyrians into disarray and they fled, pursued by the Israelites.Several episodes from the story have been illustrated in art, but the commonest shows Judith with the severed head of Holofernes, usually accompanied by her maid who holds a sack. The image of Judith occurs first in the Middle Ages as an example of virtue overcoming vice and may be associated with the allegorical figure of Humility. She is also widely depicted in the Renaissance when her victory sometimes forms a companion-picture to Samson and Delilah and Aristotle and Campaspe. Such juxtaposing suggests that the theme was then regarded as an allegory of man's misfortunes at the hands of a scheming woman. In Counter-Reformation art the theme surprisingly prefigures the Visitation, as an expression of victory over sin.Michelangelo's representation of the scene is interpreted either as the symbol of the liberty or the personification of the triumphant Church.

23310-15nativi.jpg	The pastoral mood, asymmetrical design, and complex spatial arrangements are typical Venetian variants on a traditional theme. Most unusual are the crucifix behind, and the mousetrap, on which the artist has signed his name in the lower right corner. The crucifix is a late - possibly much later - addition by Lotto. The idea of concentrating in one image the initial (the Nativity) and final (the Crucifixion) moment of the Redemption seems to derive from Venetian ideas.

21231-hip-hip.jpg	Around 1870, growing numbers of Scandinavian (Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish) artists took to visiting Paris, the modern metropolis with its many-sided art scene. They attended the school of Lï¿½on Bonnat, or the Acadï¿½mie Julian, or the Acadï¿½mie Colarossi. Some of them were tutored by  Jean-Lï¿½on Gï¿½rï¿½me. When summer arrived and tuition ceased at the private schools in Paris, the artists deserted the city. The coast of Brittany was especially popular for painting holidays. In the 1880s, there was a Swedish artists' colony at Grï¿½z-sur-Loing, by the Fontainebleau woods.In due course the artists took the idea of the artists' colony back to Scandinavia with them. The most famous of the northern colonies was at Skagen in Denmark. Many Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish artists returned there every summer, to paint in the fine northern light in the company of friends old and new.The composition of this painting was based on a photograph taken in summer 1884. The party was in the garden of the Anchers (husband and wife were both artist) at Skagen. We see the artists raising their champagne glasses in a toast. The motif of movement captured in the male group is nicely complemented by the tranquillity of the seated women and the child.

36904-parting.jpg	Serodine executed this painting between 1625 and 1626 for the Gallery of Asdrubale Mattei's palace, the last major decorative project to be carried out in the Roman naturalistic style. It is mentioned with an attribution to Serodine in a 1631 inventory, along with its pendant The Tribute Money, now in the National Gallery at Edinburgh.The composition of the canvas, the deportment of the figures, and the details of the two saints at the centre all derive from the Capture of Christ, painted by Caravaggio for Ciriaco Mattei in 1602; although Serodine's picture is less composed and more convulsed. The powerful execution of the figure, illuminated by lamplight, and the density of the impasted paint - in several places crumbled on account of the artist's imperfect mastery of oil technique - foreshadows Serodine's activity as a stuccoist and a sculptor, as well as revealing his formation as a self-taught painter

39689-10pieta.jpg	In the second half of the 16th century Titian was continually overburdened with commissions for work - from Charles V and Philip II, from the Republic and from many churches. Overcoming the crisis of Mannerism shortly before his stay in Rome at the Papal court (1545/6), Titian's work now took on a new incomparable coherence of vision and creative force. We witness the triumph of colour and light over the Renaissance notions of sculptural form. In his later works Titian's handling of colour is suffused with spirituality; his youthful themes lose their Phidian serenity and from the burning rhythm of interwoven tones which melt slowly into the glowing tints images emerge, at times dramatic, at times full of emotion for lost earthly happiness.In his Piet&#224;, originally planned for his tomb at the Frari and left unfinished at his death Titian achieves the high point of the expressive possibilities of his 'alchimia cromatica'. The work was completed by Palma il Giovane who added the torch-bearing cherub. The opaque density of this detail contrasts with the 'magical impressionism' of Titian's tonal harmonies. In the shimmering nocturnal scene figures of flesh and marble are evoked by a suffusion of glowing colour. And along the diagonal formed by the figures we are witness to an outpouring of human passion: Mary Magdalene turns in a cry of uncontrollable grief, the Virgin appears frozen in contemplation of her dead son and St Jerome leans forward to catch the last breath of Christ

37524-1confirm.jpg	The abbey of Monteoliveto Maggiore which stands atop a spur of the Crete Senese, the barren, rocky country southeast of Siena, is one of the most important and best preserved monastic complexes in southern Tuscany. It was founded by the prominent and well-to-do legal scholar Giovanni Tolomei (1272-1348), who resigned his post as podest&#224; of Siena and renounced his worldly interests to take up the life of a hermit. He was joined by two other men from Siena, Ambrogio Piccolomini and Patrizio Patrizi. The three built themselves shelters in this hostile landscape and over the years still others were attracted to the fledgling ascetic community. On March 26, 1319, the Bishop of Arezzo, Guido Tarlati, confirmed the congregation as a new religious order.The painting of the confirmation of the Olivetan rule in the monastery of Sant'Anna in Camprena, near Pienza, which was founded by monks from Monteoliveto in 1324, is part of a cycle painted by Sodoma in the refectory in 1503-04.

31395-paolina4.jpg	"The seemingly plastic organization of the walls features bronze chiaroscuri framed in stone; round-headed niches flanked by columns, with ""living"" figures of the Virtues; overdoor paintings with female personifications; and pairs of putti holding bronze tondi. The plastic organization of the walls enters into competition with the fully plastic, partially gilded stucco of the ceiling and its colourful paintings.The six ceiling paintings and the large wall areas were reserved for scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, while the act of Apostle Paul - from his conversion to martyrdom - were depicted in the six tondi above the doors of the room. The selection of these two protagonists was clearly intended to play on the two names of the pope (Alessandro Farnese having become Paul III).Perino del Vaga painted just a part of the frescoes, the other parts being done by collaborators following his cartoons. Marco Pino from Siena, a student of Beccafumi, painted the six Alexander scenes on the vault:1. Alexander the Great before the High Priest2. Alexander the Great in the Temple of Jerusalem3.

09273-colonna1.jpg	The powerful Colonna family had lived on the western slope of the Quirinale in Rome since the Middle Ages. Over the years it managed to link together the various houses it had built and purchased over time into a unified ensemble of palaces, courtyards, and gardens. In the seventeenth century, the art-loving cardinal Girolamo I Colonna (1604-1666) began turning the complex into a Baroque residence. Construction began in 1650. The south wing, containing the Grande Galleria, was built between 1661 and 1700 at the behest of the cardinal's nephew Lorenzo Onofrio (1637-1689).The most important room in the palace is the gallery (Grande Galleria) on the second floor of the south wing. It is more than a story and a half in height, and it receives light from both sides. It has two separate anterooms, marked off from the main space by pairs of columns. These extensions and the wall arrangements of the room with large pilasters produced the most magnificent secular space from the Roman Baroque.The painting of the gallery was begun in 1665 and lasted until 1685. The pictorial program unfolds in the vaults of the trio of rooms and it is supplemented to this day with the original statues, paintings, and elaborate furnishings. The architecture painting and framing is by Johann Paul Schor and his workshop, the narrative cycle on Marcantonio II Colonna is by Giovanni Coli and Filippo Gherardi, two painters from Lucca working as an inseparable team. The scenes on the ceiling illustrate decisive events from the military career of Marcantonio II Colonna (1535-1584). In its form and composition the narrative cycle borrows from sixteenth-century Venetian painting, which beginning with Veronese had specialised in depictions on ceilings of historical events viewed from extremely low vantage points

43955-1luke.jpg	"This work shares the solidity and monumentality of its figures with the Deposition (Prado, Madrid), but differs from it in a striking atmospheric effect of chiaroscuro, a quality typical of the art of Jan van Eyck. In fact Rogier is referring directly in his St Luke Madonna to a painting by Jan van Eyck, the Madonna commissioned around 1435 by the Burgundian chancellor Nicolas Rolin and consequently known as the Rolin Madonna (Louvre, Paris). As well as the ideas about the atmospheric use of light and shade that Rogier derived from this picture, he also adopted its overall construction and many motifs from Jan van Eyck's painting, including the colours of the garments worn by the main figures. They are arranged in the picture as in the van Eyck model, except that the Virgin and her companion have changed sides.These similarities of colour and light show that Rogier must have seen the original version of the Rolin Madonna, and he can have done so only in Jan van Eyck's studio in Bruges before Chancellor Rolin collected the picture, which was for his private enjoyment only and so was not accessible to the public thereafter. The meeting in Bruges between the two men who were by now the greatest and most famous painters north of the Alps - perhaps they were already acquainted - cannot have taken place very long after 1435, and may well have been accompanied by a lively exchange of ideas. At any rate, Rogier as town painter of Brussels not only profited by his knowledge of the Rolin Madonna, he also obviously came away from Jan van Eyck with new ideas and sketches of other motifs, soon to be used in his own workshop.In spite of the inspiration Rogier had gained from Jan van Eyck, his St Luke Madonna is an entirely independent depiction of the subject, and was to establish a new tradition. In a departure from earlier paintings of the subject, Rogier's saint is not himself painting the Mother of God but recording the silverpoint drawing. This corresponds to the practice of contemporary portraiture, and also emphasizes the spiritual significance of the picture more than the long, craftsmanlike activity involved in painting itself.By comparison with other works by Rogier, the extremely picturesque qualities of the chiaroscuro in the St Luke Madonna are particularly marked. Perhaps the artist, impressed by this effect in the pictures of Jan van Eyck, used it here because the painting not only honoured the saint but also stood for the painter's craft. In addition, Rogier was demonstrating another modern artistic achievement, and thus - whether in homage or in a spirit of rivalry - was referring explicitly to the other famous Flemish painter of his time. On the whole, however, he interpreted his model very much in his own way: where Jan's figures are embedded in a world of light and shade, Rogier's figures clearly claim more attention than the rest of the picture. The landscape in the Rolin Madonna seems to stretch backward for ever, suggesting in its countless details the whole teeming fullness of the world. In Rogier's picture it goes no further than its immediately visible part, and is cut off by architectural features at the sides; similarly the inner room, open to the elements in Jan's painting, has acquired a ceiling in Rogier's painting. The small town in the background is animated by little figures (including a man urinating outside the town walls) but it is possible to count them all - what is a whole universe in Jan's painting here becomes a comparatively flat background for the figures, one that can be completely surveyed.In those figures themselves, however, Rogier shows himself far superior to Jan van Eyck as an innovator. His Virgin is the quintessence of tender maternal love, simultaneously humble and proud; she is presented to the observer in such a way that (unlike Jan's Madonna) she is effective even without the context of the picture, and may be seen as typical of representations of the Virgin by herself. Instead of the masses of folds in Jan's painting, her garment in Rogier's version of the scene forms attractive calligraphic patterns. St Luke is not kneeling motionless before her, absorbed in his work, but is approaching gently like the angel of the Annunciation. Although he is seen in the act of kneeling, it does not jar on the viewer that he could hardly execute a portrait sketch in that attitude, since his activity is not emphasized for its own sake. Instead, his mobile, sensitive hands express both veneration of the Virgin and the intellectual aspect of portraiture. The saint is deliberately captured in a state between movement and repose, which could be the reason why, by comparison with those in the Rolin Madonna, the figures have changed sides: the direction of the saint's movement runs counter to the usual way of ""reading"" a picture (from left to right) and is thus inhibited - if St Luke were seen approaching from the left his movement would appear too emphatic"

24619-diptych1.jpg	"This painting is testimony to the high cultural climate of the time, and evidence of the links between two great humanist thinkers; Erasmus of Rotterdam and Sir Thomas More, both of whom contributed to the publication of Utopia. The portrait is one of two panels of a diptych that Massys painted in 1517, while Erasmus was in Antwerp as the guest of his friend Pierre Gillis. In a letter to More written on the thirtieth of May, 1517, Erasmus affirmed that ""They are painting both me and Pierre Gillis on the same panel"". The portrait was completed on the ninth of September of that same year, and the diptych was sent as a gift to Thomas More. More expressed his thanks for the gift enthusiastically in his letter of October 6, 1517, writing; ""I am marvelously affected by the portraits of the men that you sent me: even if they had been only simple sketches of charcoal or on gessetto, they would enchant any person except one completely insensitive to literature or to virtuosity; and they touch me more than I am possibly able to explain as they are mementos - now tangible - of such good friends"".Erasmus is shown, intently at work, translating the epistle of St Paul to the Romans. The second half of the diptych, with the portrait of Pierre Gillis, is now in the collection of Lord Radnor at Longford Castle (Salisbury). Replicas of the portrait of Erasmus can be found at the Rijskmuseum in Amsterdam and at Hampton Court (England), while the Royal Museum in Antwerp possesses a replica of the portrait of Pierre Gillis. In the Web Gallery of Art you can view several portraits of Erasmus by Renaissance painters, such as Hans Holbein the Younger, Albrecht Dï¿½rer and Quentin Massys"

24266-vase_fl1.jpg	The sole aim of the layout of this bouquet on a stone tabletop, is to prominently display a wide variety of flowers. The abundance out of which a rose, narcissi, tulips, anemones, jasmine, carnations and, at the top, a branch of passion-flower materialise, does not in any way detract from our viewing, as each flower is different from the others, in both form and colour. The painter depicts pistils, open and closed petals, stems curling in on themselves, and backlit foliage with an entirely naturalist precision. The gaps between the leaves allow the warm browns of the backdrop to filter through, in opposition to the cold greens of the richly decorated metal vase and of the foliage of the foreground.

28759-3marytud.jpg	The painting represents Mary Tudor, the bride of Philip II, King of Spain. This is the masterpiece of the artist, painted in England.Philip II and Mor became acquainted during the prince's visit to the Netherlands in the early 1550s. In 1554, when Philip went to London for his marriage to Mary Tudor, he brought Mor to paint the queen's portrait, a representative work that reveals the essence of his style. In keeping with the prevailing manner of court portraiture, Mor is concerned with physiognomic accuracy but not with expression. This is a reticent image that emphasizes the social distinction of the sitter instead of her personality, although it is subtly encoded with a complex set of allusions. However, the austerity is somewhat relieved by the attention paid to the costume and jewelry, which are rendered with a technique of dazzling exactitude

13681-vision.jpg	"Art historians once agreed in giving this painting to the hand of an anonymous painter known only as the ""Pseudo Bramantino"", on account of his closeness to the manner of Bartolomeo Suardi, known as Bramantino or alternately ""Pietro Ispano"", or ""Sardo"". This figure was eventually identified with Pedro Fernï¿½ndez, a painter who manifests evidence of having trained under Lombard and central-southern Italian influences; at the same time remaining true to his Catalan origins. This painting belongs to the period of the painter's Roman sojourn when he was serving in the workshop of Raphael and working on the decoration of the Vatican apartment of Pope Julius II. Scholars have dated the painting to the moment just prior to the date of a 1514 document that definitively proves Fernï¿½ndez's presence in Rome.The painting was originally placed on the high altar of the monastery of Montorio Romano, a church dedicated to St Michael the Archangel in an area of the Sabine hills. This mountainous zone is actually depicted in the landscape in the background of the painting. The scene shows the vision of the Blessed Amedeo Menez de Sylva, a Franciscan monk of Spanish origin who was the founder of the Amadeite branch of the order. Though suppressed in 1598, the Amadeites were active in Lombardy and Lazio between the end of the fifteenth and first part of the sixteenth centuries. The narrative of Amedeo's vision is derived from the Apocalypsis Nova, a report that he wrote about his ecstatic trances and his dialogues with the Archangel Gabriel. The painting shows his vision of a celestial court positioned on a disk that hovers in the air and takes the form of Bramantesque architecture.The commission of the painting is connected to a miracle that led to the construction of Santa Maria delle Grazie: Giustiniana Orsini had given money for the building of the convent in thanks for the intervention of the Blessed Amedeo in the miraculous healing of her son"

It is characteristic of Altichiero that he did not limit the scene to the figures of the knight slaying the dragon with his lance and the princess; he added a rocky landscape that stretches deep into space at the left of the image and, as a counterpart to this on the right, included a fantastic image of the city of Silene from whose walls the king and his wife, as well as the inhabitants of the city, follow with frightened looks the battle taking place before the city gate

30234-05apol1.jpg	The characteristic artist of Venetian mannerism, the young Palma (the grandson of the brother of Palma Vecchio) divided the story into two parts and painted a matching set of paintings based on it. The first picture depicts the musical contest between Apollo and Marsyas in the presence of Midas, the king of Lydia. The central character is Apollo, dressed in a red robe with his laurel-garlanded head bent over the violin. Instead of Marsyas's own instrument, the Phrygian double recorder, a syrinx or shepherd's pipe appears in the second picture in front of King Midas. He deemed its music superior to the sound of Apollo's divine instrument and was punished by growing ass's ears. The pagan flutist, however, received harsher punishment: the majestic but merciless young god is preparing to have him flayed.The landscape background with clear blue sky in both paintings evokes the world of myths, in which the happiness and cruel justice of the eternal gods coexist for the edification of the observer.Thus in this artistic conception the elements of Apollo's two musical duels are present and are even intermingled. It seems the painter did not adhere to the Ovidian source. In this time only the moral of the two episodes was important: the victory of divine stringed instruments over the sensual wind instruments

07472-10bacch.jpg	In order to understand the historical position of Caravaggio's art, we have to be aware of his peerless and revolutionary handling of subject matter. This is true not only of his religious themes, but also of his secular themes. His Bacchus no longer appears to us like an ancient god, or the Olympian vision of the High Renaissance and Mannerism. Instead, Caravaggio paints a rather vulgar and effeminately preened youth, who turns his plump face towards us and offers us wine from a goblet held by pertly cocked fingers with grimy nails. This is not Bacchus himself, but some perfectly ordinary individual dressed up as Bacchus, who looks at us rather wearily and yet alertly.On the one hand, by turning this heathen figure into a somewhat ambiguous purveyor of pleasures, Caravaggio is certainly the great realist he is always claimed to be. On the other hand, however, the sensual lyricism of his painting is so overwhelming that any suspicion of caricature or travesty would be inappropriate.

36039-harbour.jpg	"A monumental triumphal arch, not unlike that of Constantine, dominates the middle ground of this harbour view. To the right stands a tall, somewhat dilapidated building with classical ornaments. The foreground is crowded with figures. On the left is a panorama of the harbour with a tower in the distance. The strong light coming from that direction creates sharp contrasts: the dark mass of the arch stands out against the evening sky, while the play of light and shade enlivens the faï¿½ade of the structure on the right.The painting is a classic example of the imaginary views of southern harbours which became popular in the seventeenth century. The Florentine Alessandro Salucci was one of the first artists to specialize in this genre, together with his ""Italianate"" colleagues from Holland such as Jan Baptist Weenix, Jan Lingelbach and Claes Berchem.

30220-4ducale21.jpg	The present decoration of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) in the Palazzo Ducale was realized after the disastrous fire of 1577 during which all the structures of the ship's-keel Gothic ceiling and the wall-paintings were destroyed. An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings. The canvases were dedicated, thematically, to the Glorification of Venice, in remembrance of the numerous military undertakings in the East or on the mainland by the Venetian ground troops. On the ceiling great importance was given to the victories of the Venetian army in conquering the mainland; along the wall to the dispute between Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa, who reached an agreement in Venice with the political mediation of Doge Sebastiano Ziani; and to the events of the Fourth Crusade, led by Doge Enrico Dandolo in the early years of the 13th century.This painting is one of the large central canvases on the ceiling of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio.

44081-05lady.jpg	Rogier van der Weyden's independent portraits are very like each other in concept and in structure. He lays out his portrait panels as clear, geometrically structured compositions within the basic pattern designed by Jan van Eyck, showing the sitter for the portrait three-quarter face, either head and shoulders or half length, in front of a uniform, usually dark background. This is very noticeable in the late Portrait of a Lady. This famous portrait is believed to be of Marie de Valengin, illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy.The upright figure is enclosed in a diamond-shaped structure of diagonals, probably even clearer originally, when the slender body would have stood out in rather more contrast to the deep, greenish blue background, which has now darkened.On the left, the wing of her head-dress forms a large diagonal line, continued in the patterned head-dress itself; on the right a rather shorter but broader wing of the head-dress balances the line, going the other way. Rogier has raised the woman's ear to allow a continuation of the line formed by the inner edge of this wing and her chin line. The effect is also to elongate her throat and neck, and the elegant line of the neck echoes the contour of her face on the left.Another diagonal runs from the lower and narrower edge of the left-hand wing of the head-dress, over the outline of the woman's right breast - which hardly stands out at all from the background today - then to her left thumb, and on along her sleeve; the opening of this sleeve, in turn, lies along the same line as the plunging neckline of her dress.These geometrical relationships do not merely provide pictorial structure; at the same time they lend the sitter a touch of austere dignity. They also emphasize an ideal expressed in the fashions that she wears: their slender, elongated elegance, the high forehead shaved at the hairline, the tall head-dress, and the lownecked, close-fitting dress pulled in below the breasts with a broad belt are all suited to that ideal. The large diagonals emphasize the slender upper body and the pointed culmination of the structure of the figure at the head, while the clear outline of the veil over her forehead makes her skull seem even taller by continuing the left-hand contour of her face, and finally sweeping elegantly upward into the head-dress. Beauty of line determines the features themselves, which are portrayed with fine, lifelike modeling. Their regular and immaculate structure, and the emphasis on such details as the sitter's large eyes and full, very sensuous lips, show that although her portrait may well have resembled her, it is still an idealization.The lighting, in contrast to the light of Jan van Eyck's portraits, is diffuse, and does not create the impression of a concrete spatial and temporal situation in which the subject of the portrait exists. This again is a kind of idealization, removing the woman in the portrait from all that is momentary and transitory. With the austere background, and her collected, deliberate attitude, which is complemented by the way her hands are placed together and her demurely lowered but alert gaze, she too expresses an aristocratic ideal of high rank - but this aspect of the portrait appears to be part of the woman's character rather than merely a pose. Rogier was probably faithfully reproducing the image that his sitter projected of herself

Attempting to drive a hard bargain, Iarbas agreed to give Dido as much land as the hide of a bull could cover. However, Dido cut a bull's hide into thin strips and used them to outline a large area of land, thereby outwitting Iarbas and securing some living space for her and her followers.

02985-borso.jpg	Borso d'Este (1413-1471) was the ruler of Ferrara for more than two decades. He succeeded his more cultured and intellectual brother Leonello, in 1450. He was made duke of Modena and Reggio by Frederick III in 1452, and in 1471, four months before his death, he was installed as duke of Ferrara.Borso was vain but his interest in portraiture was not merely an expression of vanity: he fully appreciated the usefulness of princely images in promoting his legitimacy and status. His portrait was included in the fresco cycles of his various residences, most memorably in the Palazzo Schifanoia, as well as on medals, coins, and in individual portraits.After 1469, his half-brother, Baldassare d'Este, became Borso's preferred portraitist.

12494-09tuche.jpg	The panel is the left side of a diptych that includes the portrait of his wife Felicitas. Inscription in the top left in another's hand: HANS TUCHER, 42 IERIG 1499. In 1824, the two portraits were included in the inventory of the museum in the J&#228;gerhaus of Weimar. After 1918, they were passed from the grand dukes to the museum.It was commissioned in the same year as the diptych of Nicolas and Elsbeth Tucher (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kassel). They had approximately the same composition because Wolgemut, Dï¿½rer's master, had already done portraits of the members of the Tucher family years before. Even the setting of the portraits is very similar. The presence of an embroidered curtain in the background, the almost identical landscape passage seen through the windows, and lastly, the windowsill set equal spatial limits to the portraits. The foreshortenings of the landscape passage are imaginative and mannered, showing roads, lakes, and mountains. On the road, in the landscape behind the man's portrait, one discerns a wayfarer; on the path, in the woman's portrait, a man on horseback. The same clouds are seen in the clear sky behind the man, as in the wife's portrait, and in Elsbeth Tucher's.Hans Tucher, a descendant of an old Nuremberg family and an important member of the city council, is depicted in lavish clothes, with a fur collar, a symbol of his high-ranking position. The head, portrayed in a more elevated position than that of his consort, is framed by soft and wavy hair. The eyes, which have slightly different size, have an open gaze, the eyelids are somewhat lowered, the nose is long and sharp, the lips thin: the result is a proud but winning look, which is also emphasized by the points of the beret folded to the back and front. Besides the ring he wears on his thumb, he holds - like Elsbeth Tucher in her portrait - another ring, gold, in his hand as evidence of his marriage, contracted in 1482 with Felicitas. She, in turn, holds a carnation, with a bud and a flower. Her plump face is turned to the left, but her gaze, with slightly melancholic eyes, looks to the right. Like her sister-in-law, she wears a gold chain around her neck, and the waistcoat, according to custom, is held by a buckle , which is engraved with the initials of her consort, H. T.The combined coat of arms of Tucher-Rieter is depicted on the verso of the Hans Tucher portrait, which became the anterior side of the closed diptych

23275-04young.jpg	"More so even than Giorgione and Titian, it is Lorenzo Lotto who should be considered the true inventor of the Renaissance psychological portrait. Lorenzo Lotto was born in Venice. Though he spent many years in Bergamo, and probably entered Alvise Vivarini's studio there, for much of his life he was restless, continually moving from town to town. In their haste to identify the artist's subjects with his way of life, many early historians of art found in his work traces of the instability and restlessness ascribed to Lotto in sixteenth-century accounts of his life. This has meant that Lotto, to whom the authorship of only a small number of paintings can be attributed beyond doubt, has come to be seen as the painter of a considerable number of idiosyncratic works whose authorship cannot finally be determined. The heterogeneous style and subject-matter of Lotto's oeuvre thus seems to confirm the conflicting nature of his personality.Reference to the ""psychological"" portrait here should not be understood in the modern sense of the epithet. The visual medium chosen by Lotto to portray mental states was less one of analytical disclosure than its opposite: enigma. His tendency to present the spectator with riddles was intensified by his mysterious symbolism, and by his frequent emblematical or hieroglyphic allusiveness. Although Lotto's allusions, in their literal sense, could be fathomed perhaps only by the ""cognoscente"" of his day, they are nevertheless capable of inspiring a wealth of vivid associative detail. This can be a source of fascination, as well as of frustration, to the the spectator who has little access to their original meaning.Lotto's early portrait of a young man wearing a round black beret and buttoned, black coat still owes much to the traditional aesthetic of imitation. Scholars have rightly pointed to the influence of Giovanni Bellini here. The physiognomy of his powerful nose and searching grey-brown eyes, which, under the slightly knitted brow, seem to brood on the spectator, to view him almost with suspicion, is so faithful a rendering of empirical detail that we are reminded of another painter, one whose brushwork was learned from the Netherlandish masters: Antonello da Messina. What is new here is the element of disquiet that has entered the composition along with the waves and folds of the white damask curtain. A breeze appears to have blown the curtain aside, and in the darkness, through a tiny wedge-shaped crack along the right edge of the painting, we see the barely noticeable flame of an oil-lamp.Curtains are an important iconographical feature in Lotto's work. The motif is adopted from devotional painting, where it often provided a majestically symbolic backdrop for saints or other biblical figures. Since early Christian times, the curtain had been seen as a ""velum"", whose function was either to veil whatever was behind it, or, by an act of ""re-velatio"", or pulling aside of the curtain, to reveal it. To judge from the curtain which fills most of Lotto's canvas, we may safely conclude that he intends to reveal very little indeed of the ""true nature"" of his sitter. What he finally does reveal is done with such reserve and discretion as to be barely insinuated. For the burning lamp is undoubtedly an emblem of some kind. It may, in fact, be an allusion to the passage in St. John: ""lux in tenebris"" ('And the light shineth in darkness', Joh. 1, 5). It is interesting to note that Isabella d'Este chose to cite this light/darkness metaphor in her own ""impresa"" in 1525, altering the original to refer to her isolation at the Mantuan court: ""sufficit unum (lumen) in tenebris"" (a single light suffices in the darkness). Perhaps Lotto intended to convey a similar message through his portrait of this young man.Although the date of this portrait is disputed, stylistic and morphological similarities to figures in the Recanati polyptych of 1508 have induced some critics to assign it that approximate date. Others have compared it to Raphael's early portraits and dated it somewhat later"

07961-farnes05.jpg	"The picture shows the ceiling vault of the Galleria Farnese with fictive stucco and Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne, painted by Annibale Carracci.A narrative scene painted on a wall as a framed picture was referred to as a ""quadro riportato,"" which to seventeenth-century thinking suggested that a framed panel painting had been translated into the medium of fresco. If a picture with the perspective of a panel painting is shifted to the ceiling, it is called a ""quadro finto"" (fictitious picture). In such a case the painted architectural framing is replaced by a painted or three-dimensional picture frame; Guido Reni's Aurora in the Casino Pallavicini-Rospiglioso is a clear example of this approach. Here the monumentality of the figures, meant to be seen up close, largely eliminates the picture space, which is only suggested as a horizon. In this Reni was following Annibale Carracci, who for the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese invented a complicated, layered framing system with which to make believable the pictures on and in front of the ceiling. It can be referred to as quadro riportato with respect to the subject matter, but quadro finto owing to the painted stuccowork framing"

44235-graveyar.jpg	Matthias Withoos was the follower of Otto Marseus van Schrieck (1619-78). Although Withoos also painted topographical views, harbours and portraits, they are best known for their mysterious dark close-ups of the live undergrowth of forest floors that give detailed views of wild flowers, weeds, thistles, and mushrooms animated by phosphorescent butterflies, insects, reptiles, and snakes. These works, strictly speaking not still-lifes, have always appealed to collectors of highly finished Dutch cabinet pictures. Naturalists have a field day identifying their flora and fauna, and so do iconographers who give detailed commentaries on their content, which are generally related to the transience theme.Van Schrieck and Withoos travelled to Italy in 1648. Withoos returned to the Netherlands in 1653 where he settled in his native Amersfoort; there he painted an imposing panoramic view of the town and was the teacher of Caspar van Wittel who popularizes veduta painting

05775-beggars.jpg	Toward 1637-38 Bourdon brought to Paris the fashion of the 'Bambocciata', the genre scenes of popular life in the suburbs of Rome made popular by the Netherlandish painter Pieter van Laer (known in Italy as Il Bamboccio).Bourdon was the one French painter who came under the influence of Poussin in Rome but who also retained his individuality. He is one of the few French painters of the 17th century who was equally adept at portrait, landscape, mythological and genre painting. This versatility, noticed by his contemporaries, has meant that only in recent years have a number of his pictures been identified. His mythological pictures are confused with those of other Poussin followers, his landscapes with those of Dughet, and his genre pictures with those of the Netherlandish Bamboccianti

07104-altarpie.jpg	During the 1550s Campa&#241;a executed his two major surviving commissions, the altarpiece of the Purification (1555) in the Cathedral and the imposing retable for the parish church of Santa Ana (begun in 1557), both in Seville. The altarpiece of the Purification, consisting of ten panels, adorns the funerary chapel of Diego Caballero, a veteran of the conquest of Peru, who had served in the colonial administration on Hispaniola. The donor and members of his family are represented in two of the predella panels, which are fine examples of Flemish portraiture and constitute an unusual record of the middle class of Spanish society.The Purification of the Virgin, the centrepiece of the retable, is a work of considerable sophistication. The basic composition is based on a print by Dï¿½rer, which has been reframed in a carefully rendered classical structure. Surrounding the central scene are personifications that embody the virtues of the Virgin Mary - Charity, Justice, Fortitude, Faith and Hope among them.This work evinces a somewhat better grasp of current Italian art, than the Descent from the Cross, which was done some eight years earlier. Campa&#241;a seems to have become a more Italianate painter although there is no record that he went to Italy after settling in Seville

07703-2annunc1.jpg	This painting has a great number of familiar symbols of the Virgin to evoke the life of a patrician Florentine. The Annunciation is shown taking place in an open court before the Virgin's house. Her bedchamber, luxuriously decorated with ermine hangings, curtains, and a small, open cupboard, is seen through a marble door at right. Behind the Virgin a green curtain has been drawn back to reveal the view through another door into a dining room, where a table, stool, and bench are arranged in front of a staircase leading up past an open window. An elaborate bronze grill is shown unlocked, with a key in its open gate. It provides symbolic as well as visual access to an area paved with inlaid marble slabs in front of an altar set up against the exterior wall of the house. Beyond this sanctified area is a deep, colonnaded portico, at the end of which is a door surmounted by an escutcheon supported by two winged putti that leads to an arbour and a closed gate. The walled garden (the 'hortus conclusus') to the left of the colonnade is surrounded by the arbour and contains cyprus trees (symbols of the Virgin), a well (the 'fons hortorum'), a thatched structure of some sort, and peacocks (symbols of immortality).The arms of Jacques Coeur (c. 1395-1456), the wealthy merchant and finance minister of Charles VII are prominently displayed in the tympanum of the door behind the Virgin, indicating that the painting was commissioned by Jacques Coeur who had a special devotion to the Annunciation: the subject is depicted in a magnificent stained-glass window illuminating his family chapel in Bourges Cathedral.It is in the domestication of the religious theme and the fastidious attention given to the architecture that Fra Carnevale reveals his authorship. Also characteristic of Fra Carnevale is the system of perspective which is based on the same principles as that found in his Annunciation in Washington

38537-3allegor.jpg	Abraham van den Tempel painted a series of three allegorical history pieces for the governors of the Lakenhal, or Clothmakers' Hall in Leiden between 1648 and 1651. The commission was a prestigious one, not only because of the size of the pictures, but also because they were history pieces to be displayed in a high ranking public building. The governors who commissioned the work were men of considerable stature, too. They were entrusted by the city fathers with the day-to-day management of one of Leiden's nine textile sectors, known in Dutch as 'neringen'. In this capacity they were responsible for the manufacture of and trade in worsted, a sector that was booming at the time. Their seat of office was the brand-new building which has been known to this day as the Lakenhal. They wanted classicist decorations worthy of their modern building.Regarding the series, Minerva Crowns the Maid of Leiden originally served as the overmantel, while the other two, Mars Banishes 'Nering' and The Maid of Leiden Welcomes 'Nering' hung on the long wall beside one another. The latter two paintings form pendants, being the same size and related in subject-matter. The theme that connects them is 'nering', the term formerly used in Leiden for the production of and trade in textile.Minerva Crowns the Maid of Leiden is a coronation scene in which Minerva, the goddess of wisdom and industry, places a crown of laurel on the head of a woman kneeling beside her, the personification of Leiden. The Maid of Leiden holds a banner emblazoned with the civic coat-of-arms, two crossed keys surmounted by laurels

37327-2orsini.jpg	"The altarpiece known as Passion Polyptych (or Orsini Polyptych), with panels now in a number of European museums (Angel of the Annunciation and Virgin of Annunciation, as well as Crucifixion and Deposition in Antwerp, the Road to Calvary in Paris and the Entombment in Berlin) is signed ""Pinxit Symon"" on the two panels of the Crucifixion and the Deposition. It presents several problems, both in terms of stylistic analysis and dating.Some scholars, stressing the fact that it is so different stylistically from all the other works of Simone's Avignon period (nervous lines and expressions), think that it may have been painted earlier and then transported to France; others believe that it may be a late work, commissioned by Napoleone Orsini, who died in the Curia in Avignon in 1342.

05088-ven_mars.jpg	The painting is signed at bottom left on tree trunk: .O. PARIDIS. /bordonoThe beautiful courtesan, with a bright scarlet dress that falls in cascades, appears in two guises. One is Venus, with an apple (or an orange, which the infant Jesus also holds sometimes instead of an apple, and which represents desire, so that it has the same metaphorical value), symbol of love and beauty, given to her by Bacchus. The fruit has a multitude of erotic associations and also alludes to the artist's own name (Paris). But she also takes on the allegorical significance of Victory, who usually holds a pomegranate in her right hand and a helm in her left. By this she is, in turn, referring to Mars, disarmed by Cupid, winged boy and the son of Venus, seated on the armor. Mars, according to Aristotle, is rightly linked with Venus, for men of war are strongly inclined to lust.The victorious Venus rests on the stump of a tree. Behind stands a stag, symbol of nobility and courtesy and emblem of the royal house of France. As well as suggesting who may have commissioned the painting, this hints at a connection between Mars and Actaeon, whose attribute is the stag. Its antlers, resembling the branches of a tree, are periodically renewed, symbolizing the continual rebirth of life. Having got this far, we can attempt a more detailed interpretation of the subject, in which, behind the common mythological theme of Mars, Venus, and Cupid, is concealed an 'Allegory of the victory of love (and of beauty) that always overcomes martial vigour,' a subject that could have been dedicated to two people in love or, on the contrary, reflect the world of courtesans, as might seem more likely from the naked breasts, the colour of the dress, and the blond tresses of the woman.It is no surprise that between 1649 and 1652, when the painting is mentioned for the first time in the collection, its subject remained an enigma and was not stated. It is clear that this sensuous mythological fable of extraordinary chromatic richness, full of stylistic preciosities as well as decorative qualities in the sumptuousness and beauty of the fabrics, has connections with the world of chivalry, the refinements of aristocratic courtesy, the works of erotic art, and the exquisite and elegant style of the Mannerists, that are all typical of Fontainebleau. We know that the artist visited the French court, perhaps twice, in 1538/39 during the reign of Francis I and in 1559/60, in the time of Francis II. Recently critics have dated this painting to both the first and the second of these visits. The second is more likely given the highly evolved style of the work.

08029-cardinal.jpg	A sister-in-law of Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, Rosalba Carriera achieves the same airy lightness of touch as her relative in her portraits. These were done in pastel and in them she explored the finest shadings of her subjects' characters, the most fleeting of their moods. Thus, without falling either into the dangers of the encomiastic portrait or of the documentary, Rosalba matches the immediacy of pastel technique to the freshness of her psychological and social penetration of her subjects, offering an unrivalled picture of the society of her time. In the Elderly Lady the mature beauty of the noblewoman and her serene good-natured existence are conveyed with incomparable skill.Typical of her work is the portrait of Cardinal Melchior de Polignac with its superb rendering of the physical features of the subject, catching immediately the wilful character of the prelate.

01034-egypt.jpg	"The unusual iconography, with the Madonna dressed in the habit of a gypsy, makes it interesting to trace the different interpretations of the painting. The concept of Ansaldo's work may derive directly from a work by Luca Cambiaso that Ratti saw during the eighteenth century at the Palazzo Barberini. In his notes on Soprani's biographies of the Genovese Painters, Ratti described how ""in Rome at the Palazzo Barberini, there is a painting of the Virgin dressed in the manner of the gypsies, who flees to Egypt with the infant Christ in her arms"".To support this hypothesis it is necessary to refer to two known Cambiaso paintings of the head of the Madonna with an identical attire, datable to around 1570, which may be smaller-format versions of the lost Palazzo Barberini picture. Even more closely related is a drawing of the Madonna of the Promenade showing the Virgin taking a stroll, wearing the same attire and large hat, and with the child held in a sling over her shoulder. Also similar iconographically and in other ways is a canvas of Bernardo Strozzi (Genoa; private collection). In the context of this connection, it is helpful to recall that Strozzi was in close contact with Ansaldo during the very years to which the painting has been dated.The painting is dated to 1620-30, since its appearance can be connected to other works from Ansaldo's period of full maturity. The numerous stylistic sources that lie at the base of Ansaldo's mature style may be discerned in this work. Cross-breeding with each other and the aforementioned Cambiasesque currents, one recognizes the influence of Barocci (as seen through his Sienese followers Banni and Salimbeni), the well assimilated influence of Rubens, as well as that of Gentileschi, who was working in Genoa during the time that Ansaldo painted this picture"

00655-lastsu.jpg	Leonardo's Last Supper was copied and adapted in several refectories, particularly in Lombardy. Andrea del Sarto's fresco in the former refectory of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Salvi in Florence also testifies to knowledge of Leonardo's fresco. The impact and movement of Leonardo's figural composition have been moderated. Andrea's narrative is more human and touching; it reduces the heroic drama of gestures and figures. It shows a nearly enclosed hall, in whose articulations the row of apostles is embedded. The community at table with Christ is given a formal pendant in the form of a window loggia. A charming, anecdotal subsidiary motif results: two servants are conversing in the central opening. Above the entire scene is an arch with medallions displaying the Trinity and the saints of the order

35910-3magdale.jpg	This painting was first recorded as a work by Andrea Sacchi in a 1692 inventory of the collection of Pope Alexander VII's nephew Cardinal Flavio Chigi. It is the oil sketch for a larger canvas version (270 x 184 cm) of the same subject, once at the convent of S. Salvi and now at on deposit at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. According to Bellori, who describes the picture in precise detail, Sacchi's protector Cardinal Antonio Barberini commissioned it directly from the artist.Considering the highly unusual subject (the three Magdalenes: St Mary Magdalene of Japan, St Mary Magdalene and St Mary Magdalene dei Pazzi), this composition must have been designed for a particular place. A scenario was proposed in which the large altarpiece was sent in 1634 by Urban VIII to the Florentine Convent of Santa Maria Maddalena dei Pazzi, where the pope's two sisters lived as cloistered nuns from 1628 to 1639. The oil sketch differs in certain details from the larger Florentine picture. The most notable of the changes is that the putti, nude in the oil sketch, are covered by drapery in the altarpiece: evidently this was done out of a sense of decorum for the cloistered ambient for which the painting was destined. Painting just after Pietro da Cortona undertook the grand vault of the Palazzo Barberini, and during the years of the bitter polemical exchange between Sacchi and Cortona about the baroque style, this painting re-proposes a classical pyramid composition. In the picture the three figures, firmly defined in their space, acquire a solemn monumentality in their classic, measured gestures. A preparatory drawing, datable to 1633, is conserved at Dï¿½sseldorf

Vasari based this attribution on Ghiberti, who in the Commentarii (written about 1447) adopted a tradition that was obviously incorrect. Now there is a broad agreement among scholars that Vasari's information on the figure and life of Barna was freely invented.

37263-90death.jpg	The frescoes of the Death and Funeral on the upper level are the last scenes of the cycle. Animated by light, colour and spatial depth, both these scenes have the same composition, with a crowd of acolytes and followers witnessing the events. The same characters, with the same features but depicted in different poses and with different gestures appear in both scenes: the priest celebrating the ritual of the deceased in the scene of Martin's Death appears in the fresco of the Funeral between the two figures with haloes; the tonsured acolyte dressed in green and red who in the Death is gazing meditatively upwards, in the Funeral is shown holding the celebrant's dalmatic.Another interesting element is the way the architectural style of the scenes follows the mood of the events: while the building in the scene of the Death of St Martin is a severe geometrical structure with bare walls, the Funeral takes place in a Gothic chapel with graceful and delicate decorations

24649-triptych.jpg	Master Bertram is one of the first artists in the history of German art who is known to us by name. His style exercised a major influence on the Hamburg school of painters. His work exemplifies the artistic position of German painting around the beginning of the 15th century, in which medieval traditions continued to live on in the prevalence of gold backgrounds, a lack of spatial setting, an emphasis on line and the use of simple compositions.In the central panel of this triptych, the majestic Holy Visage makes a strong impression, which the painter achieves by giving it a certain realism, modelling the volumes through subtle tonal gradation; the down-cast eyes, in particular, add expressiveness to Christ's face. The side panels depict two musical angels, who convey a sense of movement and have well articulated bodies, even though they retain the decorative character which links them to Gothic art. Without great technical display, the artist creates the impression that the figures are firmly placed on the ground and are three-dimensional forms. This is achieved through the movement of the draperies and a slight but successful gradation of light and shade, made possible through the use of oils, which were more flexible than tempera.The side wings fold into the centre to close the triptych, and hence are also decorated on the back, in this case with an Annunciation

10470-sacrame1.jpg	This painting belongs to a series by Crespi depicting the seven sacraments as individual scenes: baptism, confession, confirmation, communion, extreme unction, ordination and matrimony.In 1739, while Crespi was still alive, the Bolognese Gianpietro Zanotti gave a thorough account of the origin of the paintings: 'One day Crespi saw a man in the confessional at San Benedetto's confessing his sins to the priest. A ray of sunlight fell on the man's head and shoulders, and was reflected inside the small chamber to produce the most beautiful contrast between light and dark that can be imagined. He [Crespi] studied it very carefully and, as soon as he was back home, did a small drawing of the scene. Then he sent two porters to fetch him a confessional, which he promptly installed in his room with staged lighting. He introduced Ludovico Mattioli, who chanced to be there, into the scene of the confession, and painted him so well that everyone recognised him, as they did the priest, who was the same person who had lent him the confessional.' Zanotti further recounts that Crespi made a gift of the painting to Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni in Rome, who was highly delighted and commissioned the remaining six paintings.Crespi treats the subjects of his paintings realistically, while simultaneously making much of incidental matters that distract from the main action, matters which belong more to chance occurrences in a genuine religious scene and not to an idealised one. Crespi dated the Baptism to 1712, giving us a clue to the dating of the whole series. A large number of replicas and copies, such as the drawn and engraved versions, speaks for the popularity of these paintings

41966-miracle.jpg	This painting is an example of Valdï¿½s Leal's weird, ecstatic style. St Ildephonsus, a seventh-century archbishop of Toledo, wrote an important treatise defending the purity of the Virgin, who, as a reward for  his devotion, presented him with a priestly vestment. In this high-strung version of the miracle, Valdï¿½s allows his imagination to run riot. Under the chill glare of an unreal light, the gaunt, hollow-cheeked St Ildephonsus rapturously fingers the vestment that falls in a cascade onto his face. Every inch of the canvas is crowded with frenetic activity, as putti fill the sky and angels jockey for position around the enthroned Virgin Mary. In a surprising and shocking change of mood, three putti in the foreground struggle for possession of the archbishop's crozier

03544-03renoir.jpg	Renoir and Bazille met in November 1862 in the studio of Charles Gleyre, where they attended drawing classes along with Monet and Sisley. The four pupils quickly became friends and left Gleyre in the spring of 1863 in order to devote themselves entirely to open-air painting. The next summer Bazille moved into a studio in Paris and shared it with Renoir. Toward the end of 1867, Bazille painted his friend in a nonchalant attitude with his feet up on the seat of his chair. The painting remained in Renoir's possession for the rest of his life. Renoir reciprocated by painting a picture of his friend in their studio. Bazille is at his easel, leaning forward slightly with his legs crossed, working on a still-life of dead birds. On the wall behind him is a winter landscape by Claude Monet with a view of Honfleur. The predominant colours in the picture are gray and beige.Despite their differences, one factor is common in these paintings: they depict what appears to be a random moment in everyday life and avoid any semblance of a posed composition

17531-9christ.jpg	This painting is also known as the Man of Sorrows. Christ is depicted here as the melancholy hero whose taut musculature and profoundly distraught expression reveal the depth of his anguish. The physical bulk of the figure and the exaggerated modeling of his muscular form led some early on to identify him as Samson. Gossart did not separate biblical from mythological subject matter in his continuing development of the sculptural form of the body as a way to convey meaning. The common source for several of the male figures in his late paintings was the Belvedere Torso.Gossart's completion of the fragment may have been inspired by Marcantonio Raimondi's signed and dated engraving, the Mars, Venus, and Eros of 1508. In the unimpeded view and detailed articulation of the musculature of the torsos, Gossart's Christ and Raimondi's Mars bear a striking resemblance

This odd view shows the pavilions that were erected for the famous Feast of the Ascension (known simply as the Sensa in Venetian dialect).The Festa della Sensa was one of the most important festivals in Venice, the climax being the celebration of the symbolic wedding between the Republic and the sea. The occasion was also marked by a regatta, as well as a ""fiera', or fair, on Piazza San Marco that could last as long as fifteen days. In this painting the Piazza is shown from the west according to a traditional scheme. The buildings and market stalls on the right side, as well as many of the strolling and inquisitive figures on the square, are bathed in a brilliant light consisting of silver and bluish shades.The Campanile of San Marco stands out exaggeratedly tall against the brilliantly clear sky, breaking the horizontal accents of the scene below. There is no greater contrast imaginable than the one between the careless elegance which this painting expresses and the dramatically charged mood which characterizes Canaletto's early depiction of the same theme (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid).It is worth noting that the Festa della Sensa, originally an important public ritual, had completely lost its political significance by the eighteenth century and become purely a tourist attraction"

24504-0view.jpg	"The chapel in the right-hand arm of the transpt in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine is consacrated to the Madonna del Popolo, and a painting of the Virgin stands on the altar. The patrons of the chapel was the Brancacci family, from the second half of the 14th century until 1780. Felice Brancacci was the patron of the chapel from 1422 till 1436. He was a rich and powerful man and he commissioned the fresco decoration of the chapel in 1423 shortly after he returned from Cairo where he had been sent as Florentine Ambassador. It is assumed that work on the frescoes began in 1424, at a time when Masaccio and Masolino were working together, and that it continued until 1427 or 1428, when Masaccio set off for Rome, leaving the fresco cycle unfinished.The appearence of the chapel today is the result of alterations begun immediately after Felice Brancacci fell out of favour; he was exiled in 1435 and declared a rebel in 1458. Further changes were carried out in the 18th and 19th centuries.Originally the chapel was cross-vaulted and lit by a very tall and narrow two-light window; the last of the stories from the life of St Peter, his Crucifixion, was probably painted on the wall below the window, but this fresco was destroyed soon after Brancacci was declared a rebel so as to cancel all traces of a patron who had become politically embarassing. The chapel, formerly the chapel of St Peter, was reconsacrated to the Madonna del Popolo. It appears that Felice Brancacci was subjected to an operation of ""damnatio memoriae"", for all the portrayals of people connected to the Brancacci family were eliminated from Masaccio's fresco of the ""Raising of the Son of Theophilus"". The scene was then restored in 1481-82 by Filippino Lippi, who also completed the cycle.After the chapel was reconsacrated to the Virgin a number of votive lamps were installed: the lampblack they produced coated the surface of the frescoes, causing such damage that as early as the second half of the 16th century they had to be cleaned.In 1670 further alterations were carried out: the two levels of frescoes were divided by four sculptures set in carved and gilded wooden frames. It was probably at this time that the leaves were added to conceal the nudity of Adam and Eve in the two frescoes, Masolino's Temptation and Masaccio's Expulsion from the Garden. This was probably conceived during the reign of the bigoted Cosimo III.After several events, including a fire in 1771, a restoration combined with a thorough scientific investigation in the last decades brought the chapel to the state in which we can visit it nowadays.The fresco cycle, with the exception of the first two, tells the story of St Peter, as follows:Temptation (Masolino)Expulsion from the Garden (Masaccio)Tribute Money (Masaccio)Healing of the Cripple and Raising of Tabitha (Masolino)St Peter Preaching (Masolino)Baptism of the Neophytes (Masaccio)St Peter Healing the Sick with his Shadow (Masaccio)Distribution of Alms and Death of Ananias (Masaccio)Raising of the Son of Theophilus and St Peter Enthroned (Masaccio and Filippino Lippi)Disputation with Simon Magus and Crucifixion of St Peter (Filippino Lippi)St Paul Visiting St Peter in Prison (Filippino Lippi)Peter Being Freed from Prison (Filippino Lippi"

40359-1hawkwoo.jpg	"In 1436 the administrators of the Opera del Duomo in Florence commissioned Paolo Uccello to paint a fresco in the Cathedral, a monument commemorating the English soldier of fortune Sir John Hawkwood (Giovanni Acuto for the Italian) who had died in 1394; Hawkwood had led the Florentine troops to victory in the battle of Cascina (1364). Still in the Cathedral today, the fresco was restored in 1524 by Lorenzo di Credi, who added the elegant frame with the grotesque pattern decorations.The fresco is a splendid example of how Uccello used the new means of expression (perspective and sculptural quality) in a totally personal way; adding to them the monochrome effect of ""terra verde"", the painter has succeeded in creating the illusion of a statue, standing on a plinth. The base is shown in foreshortening, so as to be seen correctly from below, whereas the warrior in on his horse is drawn in full frontal perspective. This seemingly contradictory use of the rules of perspective, which has given rise to innumerable debates, is further evidence of the originality of Uccello's language. The unnatural movement of the horse, which is raising both its right legs at the same time, was pointed out as a serious mistake by Vasari, but it is justified by the consistency of Paolo's perspective construction.In the Monument to Sir John Hawkwood there are also some elements derived from Masaccio's painting, like the trompe 1'oeil perspective of the base, very similar to the base below Masaccio's Trinity, and the sculptural relief of the horse and the rider created with a strong chiaroscuro. And furthermore, as in all Masaccio's works, the light comes from the left and is very natural. But there are just as many elements that clearly distinguish Paolo's art from Masaccio's: Uccello's realism is much more analytic than synthetic, in other words it is more similar to the late Gothic style than to Masaccio's. Uccello's analytic realism blends extremely well with his geometrization of forms, which contributes to the overall effect of abstractism conveyed by his works. In other words Paolo's compositions are more abstract and symbolic than natural: this painting is more a portrayal of the idea of a warrior than of a warrior in flesh and blood.The administrators of the Opera del Duomo did not appreciate the fresco at all, and ordered Uccello to paint it again, which the artist did. We do not know exactly what Paolo changed, but he probably just toned down the colours, which were considered too bizarre"

17990-13vault.jpg	"In the apsidal chapel's umbrella vault, with angels on either side, St Francis is enthroned in glory with angels on either side. In the five spandrels, against a star-studded heaven with cirrus clouds, he is surrounded by the most important saints of the Franciscan order. During previous restoration work the names of the saints were repainted incorrectly: S(ANCTUA) A(N)TO(NIUS), St Anthony of Padua; S(AN)C(T)A CATARINA [sic], St Clare of Assisi; S(ANCTUS)BERNAR(INUS), St Bernadine of Siena; S(ANCTA) ROSA VIT(ERBENSI)S [sic], St Catherine of Siena; S(ANCTUS L)UDOVICU(S) R(E)X, St Louis of France.The architectural structure of the polygonal apse on a pentagonal plan; covered by a ribbed umbrella vault, obliged Benozzo to make use of an extremely Gothic division of the cycle, which threatened to place limits on his expressiveness. And in fact, while the five Franciscan saints fit in nicely, one to each segment, with their backdrop of a starry sky and support of rose-coloured clouds, the solid St Francis seated in glory is almost squashed into the segment bordering on the underside of the arch, with a sculptural force that spills over into the blazing circle of seraphim, ""cut"" by the triangular field.

23615-c_adored.jpg	Alessandro Magnasco's first training was in the artistic circles of late seventeenth century Genoa where the styles most favourably regarded were those of Rubens and the painters of Lombardy with their considerable use of chiaroscuro (Morazzone in particular). These influences led Magnasco towards a visionary, fantastic language characterized by stylistic modes of an expressionistic rapidity of execution and a tormented luministic violence. The pictoricism of Magnasco, of which Christ Adored by Two Nuns is a significant example, worked on the imagination of many Venetian painters, and of Sebastiano and Marco Ricci and Francesco Guardi in particular

30910-madonna.jpg	Pesellino (Francesco di Stefano) painted this composition at least twice. It shows the Madonna on a splendidly carved marble throne and the little Jesus in his mother's lap playing with a goldfinch. One of these panels found its way to the Isabella Gardner Museum in Boston, the other came into the possession of the Esztergom Museum. The design of the two paintings is almost identical, the only noteworthy difference can perhaps be observed in the execution of the Virgin's right hand. Judging from this difference the Esztergom version is probably the earlier version of the two.The meditative, somewhat melancholy facial expression of the Virgin indicates a religious ideal which will reach its artistic culmination in the works of Fra Filippo Lippi, and still later in the works of Botticelli. The goldfinch which the Child Jesus clutches in his hand is a symbol of his suffering and death, and the brooding look of the Mother already suggests the future agony of the Saviour

25372-shadow.jpg	The reception of Impressionism in Canada began about a decade later than in the US in the 1890s. Though the fashion for Canadian artists after 1890 was to study in Paris at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts  or the leading private academies, it was rare for them to grapple with the technique of Impressionism. When they did, it was either a case of direct imitation of the French model, as with Helen McNicoll, or - and this applied to the majority - of briefly adopting a style as a transition to other approaches

24603-c_cross.jpg	In this triptych Massys achieves a perfect harmony between religious theme and landscape, traditional medieval scheme and innovative Renaissance elements. The Calvary group is based on a well-established medieval type. St John, gazing up at the Cross and wringing his hands, and Mary Magdalene, sinking to her knees at the foot of the Cross, are derived from earlier Crucifixion groups. The Virgin Mary is often shown in paintings of this kind but, in Massys' version she stands next to the Cross, her hands crossed on her chest, entirely withdrawn in sorrow. The weeping Mary Cleopas stands behind her. The colours are deeper and the details more pronounced than in many other works by Massys.The realistic grief of the figures contrasts sharply with the lush, restful landscape in which the city of Jerusalem appears in the background. Massys shows himself here to be a transitional figure between the Gothic and Renaissance periods. His figures are undoubtedly Gothic in inspiration, but the fertile landscape expresses a sense of universality which points towards the Renaissance. The landscape is very similar  to those of Joachim Patenier and might have been influenced by him.The painting was dated to around 1520 on the basis of the costume worn by the donors shown in the wings. These kneeling figures have not been identified, although we know their Christian names because of their respective patron saints who appear with them. The man is accompanied by St Jerome, and the woman by St Mary of Egypt
