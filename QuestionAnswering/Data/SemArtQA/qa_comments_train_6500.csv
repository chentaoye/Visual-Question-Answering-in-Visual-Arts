A small Italian maiolica vase stands on an Oriental carpet in a niche. It holds a bouquet of lilies, irises and columbines, symbolising Mary's virginity, her suffering and Christ's birth and death.

Thought to be the Gattamelata's portrait - a famous Italian captain (1370-1443) - the picture has been ascribed to the last activity of Giorgione, dead in 1510, although the attribution is not certain since some critics referred it to other artists as Paolo Morando called il Cavazzola.Restored in 199

05840-4empero.jpg	The picture shows the right wing of the diptych The Justice of Emperor III.The Emperor had married the daughter of the King of Aragon. His wife subsequently fell in love with a count of the imperial court. When the latter refused to respond to her advances, she publicly accused him of having made an attempt upon her honour. The Emperor, in a fit of anger, had the count beheaded on the spot. The count's wife asked to prove the truth of her husband's innocence by the ordeal of fire. She won her case, surviving the test unharmed. The Empress was found guilty of false accusation, and condemned to be burned alive.In the second panel, the Emperor is giving an audience to the widow. He sits on a throne beneath a dais, while she kneels before him to ask for reparation. In one hand she holds the livid head of her dead husband, and in the other a bar of red hot iron. The bar does not burn her, thus proving the innocence of her dead husband. Through an open doorway, we can see a hill in the background. There on a burning pyre, the Empress is punished according to her deserts.The original project, a cycle of four panels, remained uncompleted at Dirk Bouts' death in 1475. One of the four panels, the Ordeal by Fire, had been fully completed, another was judged to be almost so (by nae volmaect). Given that the entire story was depicted on two panels, at least one more theme must have been planned. The complete cycle is reminiscent of the work that Rogier van der Weyden undertook in c. 1440 for the Council Chamber of the Brussels City Hall, consisting of four panels with the exemplary Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald

12010-jupiter1.jpg	The subject is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses (Book 3, verses 287-309). Semele was one of Jupiter's many mortal lovers. Upon discovering her husband's infidelity, Juno convinced Semele to ask Jupiter to make love to her in his full divine glory. This he reluctantly began to do, surrounded by light and thunder, as can be seen in the present picture, but the might of his power consumed her - a mere mortal - with his lightning. Mercury managed to rescue the unborn child from her womb and placed it in Jupiter's thigh, from which the child, Bacchus-Dionysus, was later born.The musculature and turned pose of Jupiter, poised to strike with his thunderbolt, illustrate Dosso's mastery of and fascination for the human form

07182-canal226.jpg	In Canaletto's day, the only crossing that spanned the largest waterway in Venice was the imposing Rialto Bridge, which consequently became the hub of both business life and traffic and a point of orientation amid the confusion of Venice's smaller canals and alleys. The artist shows the bridge in the veduta that looks out to the north-east from Palazzo Balbi.Canaletto shows on the far left a section of the Palazzo Balbi, to the right the Palazzo Contarini dalle Figure and the four palazzi of the Mocenigo family. In the distance we can see the Rialto Bridge, and beyond that to the right the roof of the church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo. In none of his other vedute has Canaletto placed such a curiously manned gondola in the foreground: the vessel, decorated with green twigs, contains two figures in Commedia dell'Arte costumes who seem to have escaped from the stage. The gondola, readied for a delightful picnic trip, is the scene of a marital drama, for the ugly old woman is clearly beating the man over his pointed hat with her oar, as he holds a tightly bundled infant out to her imploringly

09328-pitti5.jpg	The picture shows the ceiling of the Antechamber, one of the adjoining three rooms on the ground floor in the summer quarters of Ferdinando II de' Medici in the Palazzo Pitti.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno) between 1637 and 1641. The adjoining three rooms of the summer suite were painted at the same time. The first two of them, the Udienza Pubblica and Udienza Privata, served as reception rooms, while the third and largest, which is directly accessible from the garden, was apparently used as an antechamber for visitors awaiting private audiences. These rooms were painted by Angelo Michele Colonna with the assistance of Agostino Mitelli with whom Colonna had established a highly efficient working relationship beginning in 1632.The Antechamber is painted in the Tuscan order and devoted to rulers of the Medici dynasty. Viewed by his four predecessors (Cosimo I, Francesco I, Ferdinando I, Cosimo II), who are in attendance as painted busts with associated narrative scenes painted in monochrome, on the ceiling Ferdinando II is receiving his authority directly from Jupiter

44294-venice3.jpg	This view shows Venice from a ship that would have been moored some one hundred and fifty metres outside the Riva degli Schiavoni. The panorama embraces the area between the Redentore, at the left on the Giudecca, and the two columns on the Molo at the far right. The entrance to the Grand Canal is located in the centre, with the Punta della Dogana and the Santa Maria della Salute to its left. Numerous boats are on the water, transporting goods, animals, and people, including one with Capuchin monks en route to the Redentore. On the left a sloop flying the Dutch flag is just being rowed out of sight. Behind it lies a large Venetian threemaster with the lion of St. Mark on its stern.The colours are light shades of grey-green, grey-blue, pink and beige, and bright red for the flags, sails and clothing. A soft, tempered light enters the scene from the northeast at a low angle on what is evidently an early summer morning. In this scene the eye is led into the distance in the west. The vantage-point chosen by Van Wittel causes the impression of two equally wide tunnel-shaped waterways, the Canale della Giudecca being however two to three times as large as the entrance of the Grand Canal.Moreover, the left waterway is obstructed by a merchant-man, while the small boats in front of it and the quay to the right lead the eye to the Grand Canal. The Santa Maria della Salute, almost an entity with the Dogana, seems to rise out of the water like an enormous vessel reflected in the Bacino. All the buildings are sharply focused and rendered with an almost painful precision; this is true also of the Salute, although its site lies more than seven hundred metres away. Van Wittel must have worked out the composition and its perspective construction from a great distance, and individual details at close range; this is the only possible explanation for the painting's unlikely degree of topographical accuracy.

40802-002scene.jpg	The picture represents one of the most characteristic themes of Spanish Romanesque painting: the Virgin with scenes from the life of Jesus on either side of the central group; it was painted by the Master of Avi�, the master responsible for the altar in the church of Avi�. These scenes are well known even today to those who appreciate early European painting: represented from left to right are the Annunciation, then the Visitation (Mary's visit to Elizabeth, the mother of St John the Baptist); the upper right scene depicts the ox and the ass bending over the Child in the manger; the bottom left scene shows the three Magi guided by the star, while the lower right scene depicts Jesus being presented in the temple. The central figure of the Child on Mary's knee is not the small adult seen in earlier paintings: the artist has portrayed a lively child who seems to be leaping out of the architectonic frame, as if to acknowledge the welcoming gesture of Melchior. This panel reveals a much more 'modern' approach than that of the Master of Seo de Urgell who executed the rigid representation of the twelve apostles in Christ and the Twelve Apostles. The colours are brighter, the contrasts sharper, the figures more animated and the drapery less schematic; but because of the emphatic red of the cheeks, the lack of perspective and the stereotyped representation of the eyes, this picture is also a characteristic example of Romanesque painting			
07760-20depart.jpg	"Canvas No. 2 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".In the scene of the Ambassadors Depart Carpaccio takes us back to the formalities of an official ceremony. The interior of the diplomatic Chancery is constructed round the interplay of various perspective foreshortenings, like the huge corridor with the stairway above the grandiose arch through which we can see the sky. As far as the eye can see the sharp outdoor light emphasizes every detail, each depicted with absolute perfection and purity of form: the marble ornamentations, with the play of light and shadow in the colourful geometric patterns; the extraordinary candelabrum; the pure white sculpture that stands out against the gold niche, its surface so smooth that it looks like a work by Antonio Rizzo; the characters arranged in poses and attitudes suited to their role and function.The regal dignity of Maurus and his counselors, some portrayed in splendid profile poses, is counterbalanced by the deferential homage being paid by the ambassadors, a contrast that is repeated in the figures of the haughty secretary and the humble scribe. Next to the bored-looking child in the red tunic, who observes his fellow in brown, shown reading, a gentleman introduces us to the ceremony with his left hand. The description of the crowd gathered along the steps and leaning against the balustrades of the building in the background is equally accurate. Everything is portrayed with great attention to detail, in the most perfect interaction of space, forms, light and colours, an anticipation of the Vision of St Augustine, the masterpiece of the cycle that Carpaccio painted in the early years of the 16th century for the Scuola di San Giorgio degli Schiavoni"

12544-2adam.jpg	Following his copper engraving dating from 1504, D�rer produced another painted version of the theme of the first human couple three years later. The two pictures of Adam and Eve (also in the Prado, Madrid) were created by D�rer after returning from his second journey to Italy. In spite of the nearly identical size of the two pictures they were intended to be separate paintings. This is corroborated by the fact that both paintings are signed although in a different way: on the lower right corner in present picture, on the small tablet hanging on the apple-tree branch held by Eve in the painting of Eve. However, the two paintings are related to each other in their composition and the movement of the figures' bodies. Adam, who is holding a branch from the Tree of Knowledge in front of himself, is turning yearningly towards Eve in the other panel. Like Eve, he is depicted in motion, walking with his hair blowing back.The primary aim of the artist in both cases was not depicting a Biblical story but creating two nude figures. These are the first German paintings representing life size nude figures

13309-12thymot.jpg	The portrait is a three-quarters view of a man of about thirty years, turned slightly to the left before an homogeneously dark background. He sports a fashionable green head-dress from which a scarf hangs down onto his right shoulder. He is also wearing a red coat with a thin fur collar. His left arm is folded behind the parapet, his left hand obscured by his right, which is holding a scroll of paper.The identity of the sitter has been the subject of considerable speculation. It would seem logical to expect the strange name which someone appears to have lettered onto the stone in Greek (Tymotheos) to provide a clue. In fact, the name did not occur in the Netherlands before the Reformation which led experts to see it as a scholarly humanist metonym to link the sitter with an eminent figure in Classical antiquity.An inscription, not unlike an epitaph, and yet evidently referring to a living person, is chiselled on the parapet: LEAL SOUVENIR (loyal remembrance)

09531-triptyc1.jpg	Viewers of Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen's Adoration of the Magi in the Rijksmuseum are both missing and gaining something compared to the faithful of Van Oostsanen's day. In its original position in the church, it was closed for most of the year, and all that could be seen were the two grisailles of Sts Christopher and Anthony on the backs of the shutters. They are hidden from sight in the present, open arrangement. Back in the 16th century, the triptych was only exhibited on major feast days (and certainly on 6 January, the feast of the Epiphany), briefly revealing the painting in all its glory.This is a private memorial, a painted in memoriam for the donors - in this case a distinguished couple with a large clutch of children. Several of the latter have identical faces, so it is likely that they died very young. The triptych was probably returned to the family when the churches were Protestantised in the 1570s, but since it is not badly damaged it may have been taken to a place of safety by the donor's descendants before the Iconoclasm broke out. Later, when it was evidently felt necessary to stress the noble descent of all branches of the family, the coats of arms were altered, making it impossible to identify precisely who the donor was. Because Jacob Cornelisz's clientele came almost exclusively from Amsterdam, he would undoubtedly have been a respected burgher of that city. The splendid, fur-lined gown (known as a tabbaard) that he is wearing makes it clear that he belonged to the highest civic circles. He can perhaps be identified as the apothecary Claes Bouwensz, who had numerous children and was also one of the forefathers of the family bearing the principal coat of arms.Jacob Cornelisz made nifty use of an invention he had come up with a decade previously. The Virgin seen from the front is presenting the Child to one of the Magi on the left in such a way that he can kiss its hand. The artist had employed that motif in a woodcut in a series illustrating the life of the Virgin. Those woodcuts served as models for other artists - possibly embroiderers, sculptors or decorative painters. In this case, though, he re-used his own compositional device. Sixteenth-century viewers very probably did not spot the repetition, but even if they did it would not have affected their appreciation of the work. The originality of a composition was not yet considered very important, and was certainly less highly prized than the wealth of colour and delicate finish

30691-paolina1.jpg	"Between 1542 and 1548 Pope Paul III transformed a series of rooms on the two upper levels of the Castel Sant'Angelo into a comfortable and at the same time impressive apartment. Time and again this castle had provided protection to popes against the incursions of secular powers, and it continued to have a military function. His predecessors had commissioned various decorations, although these have been lost. The newly decorated rooms were to provide leisure and spiritual rest - the typical purpose of a country house or villa. The mythological subjects with which some of the rooms were painted thus correspond to what one would expect in a villa, but hardly in papal apartments.The largest room of these apartments, the great hall today called the Sala Paolina after the pope who commissioned it, surprises the visitor with its festive exuberance. Most important is the impression of the whole which presents itself to the eye and aims to overpower visitors to the room with the sheer display of riches, splendour, and bounty. This impression is the  result of the decorative system designed by Perino del Vaga.The seemingly plastic organization of the walls features bronze chiaroscuri framed in stone; round-headed niches flanked by columns, with ""living"" figures of the Virtues; overdoor paintings with female personifications; and pairs of putti holding bronze tondi. The plastic organization of the walls enters into competition with the fully plastic, partially gilded stucco of the ceiling and its colourful paintings.The six ceiling paintings and the large wall areas were reserved for scenes from the life of Alexander the Great, while the act of Apostle Paul - from his conversion to martyrdom - were depicted in the six tondi above the doors of the room. The selection of these two protagonists was clearly intended to play on the two names of the pope (Alessandro Farnese having become Paul III).Perino del Vaga painted just a part of the frescoes, the other parts being done by collaborators following his cartoons. Marco Pino from Siena, a student of Beccafumi, painted the six Alexander scenes on the vault"

On each occasion he did something original with it. In this early example the image is very striking. In contrast to most Dutch artists who made of the theme a sumptuous, or at least cluttered, genre scene, Rembrandt depicts a bare room with the plaster cracked and peeling from its walls and with a large panel on the easel, its back evocatively turned towards the spectator.

36818-pieta.jpg	Generally called a Piet&#224;, perhaps it is better regarded as a Lamentation, although the full-figured seated Mary is very materially present. In fact the impact of Michelangelo on the Venetian artist is here dramatically present, in the greater than previous attention that Sebastiano pays to human anatomy on the one hand, and the monumentalisation of the figures on the other. One should not, however, belittle Sebatiano's invention in this, among the finest images painted in the second decade of the sixteenth century

36798-carondel.jpg	"This portrait is an outstanding work of its kind. Sebastiano's technical mastery is evident in the elaboration of the forms the naturalness of the figures' poses, their expressions and gestures. The treatment of light is clearly subjective and deliberately dramatic, serving to highlight the principal figure of Carondelet, while his two secretaries on either side are in shadow (one of them barely distinguishable). Behind the figures and also in shadow is a classical-style portico with Corinthian marble columns, a coffered ceiling and in the background a pediment. On the right the depiction of the evening landscape reveals Sebastiano's Venetian origins. The golden-tinted clouds and sky lend this section of the canvas the character almost of an independent landscape.The text on the sheet of paper which the principal protagonist holds in his hand can be translated as: ""To the honourable, loyal and beloved Ferry Carondelet, Archdeacon of Besancon, Imperial Councillor and Commissioner in Rome."

39807-07granve.jpg	In 1548, Titian was summoned to Augsburg by the Emperor Charles V. The purpose behind it was to help celebrate the emperor's recent victory at M�hlberg. Titian left Venice in early January 1548 accompanied by assistants including his son Orazio and his cousin Cesare Vecellio. At Augsburg, Titian was set to work on painting portraits of Charles and members of his family. He was also required to paint the portraits of leading members of the Habsburg court. In all, Titian and his assistants executed some twenty portraits during their eight-month sojourn in Augsburg.One of the portraits painted in Augsburg was that of Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle (1517-1586), Bishop of Arras. He was a French statesman, made a cardinal, who followed his father as a leading minister of the Spanish Habsburgs, and was one of the most influential European politicians during the time which immediately followed the appearance of Protestantism in Europe. He was also a notable art collector, the greatest private collector of his time, the friend and patron of Titian and Leoni and many other artists

29325-1nagybal.jpg	"Nagy Balogh painted his self-portraits as sketches at the beginning of his  career. Later, his best pictures came from among them. Pictorial qualities dominated them more and more, e.g. changes of shadow and light, emhasis of transitions between flat and uneven and the ambition to arrest the most characteristic elements of his own face with  the simplest tools. The resulting pictures are varied just like the range of psychic states. They are all characteristic examples of self-study and intospection because periods of despair and stagnation during his career and successes at the peak of his  career are reflected in the picture.Self-confidence as a result of his results and tranquility characterize his later ""Self-Portrait"" considered by art experts particularly as ""Dutch"". Nagy Balogh's self-portraits generally show Rembrandt's influence, whereas portraits painted around 1912 are close to Frans Hals' pictures. Lajos N�meth mentions in his monograph on Nagy Balogh that the painter must have seen Hals' ""Portrait of  the Painter Jan Asselyn"" in the Museum of Fine Art. The structure of the face, the moustache, the brilliant brushwork and the way he treated whites suggest Hals' influence, the portrait is still a typical picture of Nagy Balogh'. The characteristic face almost like a square and the  hat projecting a shadow on the forehead, few colours, e.g. yellows, whites and greys glazed on the dark background and producing greenish reflexes - these are all very typical of Nagy Balogh. Mil�n F�st, a Hungarian poet, wrote the following about his late picture: ""It was a portrait in light colours, painted with wide brushstrokes. It was the deep restfulness of  the composition which fascinated me at first. A portrait like that could only be painted by a person who had gone through the sufferings of struggles and hesitations, who had reconciled with himself and the world, whose fire was steady: it does not cease burning and it has no emotions ... The person who painted it, managed to concentrate his powers, and all skills reached a maximum whenever he took the brush into his hand."

17753-405goya.jpg	Goya painted this grand portrait of his friend and patron Jovellanos (1744-1811), the learned writer and liberal statesman, at the time of his appointment as Minister of Grace and Justice. The liberal patriot and nobleman fought - with increasing success - for reforms and against ignorance, superstition and the Inquisition. The portrait was painted while the court was at Aranjuez.Not long afterwards Goya painted a portrait of Francisco de Saavedra, Minister of Finance, after he succeeded Godoy as Secretary of State (March 1798), in similar pose. Heroes of a brief liberal interlude, both ministers were soon to be relieved of their posts, victims of Godoy: Jovellanos to become a political prisoner in Mallorca for seven years. Jovellanos, who was 54 years old when he came to power and was painted by Goya, is known to have taken much trouble with his hair, here seen carefully dressed, as he refused to wear a wig. Goya has placed his sitter in a rich setting, with muted lighting, seated in melancholy pose, beside an ornate table covered with papers and with an inkwell. A statue of Minerva in bronze is a tribute to the sitter's great learning and distinguished position at the time of the painting. Jovellanos bequeathed Goya's portrait to his friend and protector, Arias de Saavedra.Jovellanos as well as Goya used the language of satire to attack social and political abuse. The second of Goya's Caprichos in which a blind-folded young woman is led to the altar by an ugly old man, takes its caption from a verse by his patron: 'They say yes and offer their hand to the first comer.' The Minister's concern for prison reform also found a response in the artist in his many illustrations of the torture of prisoners

23318-1trescor.jpg	Battista Suardi was a member of a leading Bergamasque family. He was Lotto's patron in Trescore where he had built the oratory in 1501-02, and soon afterward had had the east wall, with its semicircular apse accommodating the altar, decorated by an anonymous and modestly gifted local painter. Lotto's task was to paint the other three walls, and the areas of ceiling between the exposed wooden beams that supported the roof.Except for the framing arch of the apse and a dado molding running round the room at head height, the simple interior had no architectural articulation. Lotto divided the west and south walls into two main horizontal zones by adding fictive moldings, illusionistically designed to match the real one. He filled the upper frieze-like zone with a series of roundels containing alternating figures of prophets and sibyls, who look and lean out of their porthole-like frames and gesticulate energetically to one another, as if across the real space of the chapel. In the main zone Lotto created vertical subdivisions by putting in fictive pilasters, and, on the south wall, by using the two tall narrow windows.This view is taken through the oratory toward the altar. To the left the north wall with the Legend of St Barbara, to the right the south wall with the Legend of St Brigid can be seen. The altar wall was decorated earlier by an anonymous and modestly gifted local painter

12528-03rose.jpg	This panel was painted for an altar for the German community in Venice, in the church of S. Bartolomeo near the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, the social and commercial centre of the German colony, where it remained until 1606. It was then acquired, after many negotiations, for 900 ducats by Emperor Rudolph II. According to Sandrart (1675), four men were hired to bring the packaged painting to the emperor's residence in Prague.Stationed elsewhere during the invasion of the Swedish troops, the painting, already very damaged, returned to its place in 1635. It underwent a first restoration in 1662. In 1782, it was sold in an auction for one florin. After having passed through the hands of various collectors, it was acquired by the Czechoslovakian state in 1930.The painting, severely damaged chiefly in the centre portion, from the head of the Madonna and continuing downward to the bottom, was clumsily restored in the nineteenth century; in this restoration, the upper side portion, left of the canopy and to Saint Dominic's head, was also included. Three copies of the work are known: one - considered the most important and which now belongs to a private collection - is attributed to Hans Rottenhamer, who sojourned in Venice from 1596 to 1606, where he took care of many acquisitions on behalf of Rudolph II; another is in Vienna; and the third, a rather modified version of the original, is in Lyon.The preparatory work of the panel occupied the artist for a long time, from 7 February until the last half of April in 1506. It consists of twenty-one preparatory drawings, executed chiefly in pen and ink on azure paper, according to the Venetian tradition; others are drawings of various characters, in the dimensions then adopted for the painting. In a letter dated 25 September, addressed to Willibald Pirckheimer, the artist communicates the completion of the work.It seems that the Confraternity of the Blessed Rosary was officially recognized by the Venetian authorities in 1506, that is, in the year D�rer carried out the painting. It is assumed that the painting was ordered by this Confraternity. On the whole, the majority of the figures in the painting have not been identified. The exceptions to this include the self-portrait of the artist; the portrait of Emperor Maximilian I; the one of the architect Hieronymus of Augsburg, engineer of the new Fondaco dei Tedeschi (1505-8) after it was completely destroyed in a fire, and who is recognizable in the far right by the square he holds; and Burckhard from the city Speyer, identified as the fourth figure form the left.St Dominic is clearly the saint whom we see to the left of the Madonna, since the institution of the rosary is attributed to him. For all the others, many names have been proposed. However, the identifications are still uncertain. The Madonna is enthroned in a field, beneath a green canopy that cherubs hold up with ribbons. Other cherubs on little clouds hold a crown of precious stones suspended above her head. At her feet kneel the pope and the emperor, on the left and right, having placed before themselves a tiara and a crown, respectively. And while the Madonna places a garland of roses on the head of the emperor, the Blessed Child places an identical one over the head of the pontifice. St Dominic, in turn, crowns a bishop. Behind the pope and the emperor, the patrons are arranged symmetrically, some of whom, in both parts of the background, divert their gaze from the Madonna. Other Bellinian cherubs descend upon them with rose garlands. In the centre of the painting, seated in front of the throne, an angel playing a lute recalls the angels playing at the feet of the enthroned Madonna in Giovanni Bellini's paintings. These details aside, the setting of the work is typically Venetian. The rigidly pyramidal composition of the painting is not Venetian. This painting has indicated that D�rer was one to have been of the first who created such composition.The Feast of the Rose Garlands is undoubtedly the most important work that D�rer created during his sojourn in Venice and was the work that ushered in the Renaissance. D�rer was obviously aware of this, as his letters and the painting itself demonstrate. The painting shows this in the distinction he gives his self-portrait: in the top right, in front of the typically German landscape passage at the foot of the mountains, with his face framed by long blond hair, donning luxurious clothes - even a precious fur cloak, in spite of the warm season - so as to be noticed among the other characters. He alone has ostentatiously turned his gaze to the spectator. Even the writing on the paper he holds is unusual for Italy. It indicates not only the time of production (five months), but next to his own name is the indication germanus. This detail was to distinguish himself from his Venetian colleagues, who evidently held him in very high regard, since even the doge and the patriarch came to his workshop to admire his work

23569-idle_ser.jpg	The range of Mae's domestic subjects is large. They show women praying, spinning, sewing, making lace, preparing food, or teaching children - all virtuous activities related to the centrality and sanctity of the home in Dutch society. A few of his pictures have veiled erotic allusions and there are some that call attention to vices. A good natured one in the latter category is The Idle Servant.The protagonist of the picture is a housewife appealing directly to us to witness the sloth of the sleeping servant who not only left her mess of pots and dishes unwashed but allows the cat to snatch a fowl. The painting's strong chiaroscuro relates it to Rembrandt but Maes's personal contribution is the emphasis he places upon creating the illusion of interior space in which the scene is set. Here the stress on the expanse of the floor is not fully successful - the pots and dishes are dangerously close to sliding off it.More importantly, he allows us to look from one room to another where conversing women introduce a minor sub-plot. The Dutch call this a kind of glimpse, a 'doorkijkje' (the diminutive of doorkijk = a look or glance). Maes did not invent the motif. It was used expertly as early as the fifteenth century by an artist unimaginatively called Hand G (variously identified as Jan van Eyck, his assistant, or his follower) on a manuscript page that shows St Elizabeth in her lying-in room after the birth of St John the Baptist. Later artists used the motif too, but Maes gave it new life when he painted a number of domestic scenes in settings similar or more elaborate than the one seen in The Idle Servant. All of them share a great sensitivity to the quality of light and atmospheric effects, and some anticipate the glorious interiors painted in Delft by Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch merely a few years later

18111-4descent.jpg	This picture reflects the influence of the Dominican monk Savonarola, who demanded religious clarity without secular ornamentation. The strict interpretation of the biblical subject matter made it completely impossible to produce a display of magnificence such as in the Medicis' private chapel. In the scene, which contains many figures, the open view into the background and the gestures of Mary and St John the Evangelist guide us compositionally towards the central theme of the Descent from the Cross.

03862-138sacr.jpg	"Bellini's Sacred Conversation the two saints are traditionally identified as Sts Catherine and Magdalene but it is more likely that they are two noble Venetian ladies who commissioned the painting.The painting is one of the loftiest expression of this frequently painted theme. It shows a magisterial development that has prompted critics to recall the fundamental teaching of Leonardo's ""sfumato"". The light, in fact, softly progressing over the faces and garments, strikes from the side of the assorted figures of the Virgin and Sts Catherine and Magdalene, silent companions of the former in sacred contemplation. Also in the characteristic symmetrical composition of all Bellini's sacred conversations, the spreading of a crepuscular and intimate light that tinges the figures is a demonstration of how far ahead Bellini was proceeding in these years in developing the concepts of space and colour which had belonged to Antonello da Messina. The indistinct background, completely lacking any kind of connotation, is just ""opened"" in depth by the two diagonal wings of the saints which close at the sides the perfect pyramid formed by the group of the Madonna and Child. What is suggested is a warm and yet transparent depth in which the figures move without being engulfed.There is also another, probably autograph version at the Prado in Madrid. The success of paintings like this can be measured by the large quantity of existing variants, mostly the work of the workshop or only partially autograph, and often reproduced in various copies"

11110-early01.jpg	Beside portraiture, Degas's early work was also centred on historical themes drawn from religious tradition or mythology. Between 1860 and 1865 he painted five historical paintings, for which there are several sketches and versions: Young Spartans Exercising, Semiramis Founding a City, Alexander and Bucephalus, Jephthah's Daughter, and The Sufferings of the City of New Orleans, the latter being his first entry at the Salon.These paintings are very original and unlike any historical painting in the nineteenth century. They conformed to the rules of classicist composition, but they were also  innovative because of the freshness of his figures and the warm colours of his landscapes.The Jephthah's Daughter is probably the most successful of these early pictures. It depicts a scene from the Old Testament. Jephthah was a great Old Testament (Judges 11:30-40) warrior, who was called upon to lead the Israelites in their war against the Ammonites. On the eve of the battle he made a pact with God, that, in return for victory, he would sacrifice 'the first creature that comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return'. The battle won, 'who should come out to meet him with tambourines and dances but his daughter, and she only a child'

15527-2birth.jpg	"""The second scene is the Nativity of the Virgin, executed with great diligence. Among other remarkable things it contains a window which lights the chamber and actually deceives the beholder..."" (Vasari).The second scene, the Birth of Mary, is one of the finest creations in the chapel. The space, which is skillfully constructed along perspective lines, opens up like a display case. It is opulently decorated, with a relief frieze in which putti are dancing a roundel. They appear to be delighting in the birth of the Virgin Mary, for as the Latin inscription at their feet proclaims: ""Nativitas tua genitrix virgo gaudium annunziavit universo mundo"" (Thy birth, O Virgin and Mother of God, brings joy to all the world). This frieze of putti was inspired by Florentine sculpture, being reminiscent of the two cantorias in the cathedral by Donatello and Luca della Robbia, created about 1435.The daughter of the donor, Ludovica Tornabuoni, is entering the birth room from the left with her retinue. She is noticed by the kneeling nurse, who turns and looks at her - an action Ghirlandaio uses to forge a direct link between the biblical and the contemporary. The stiff appearance of this young aristocrat forms a stark contrast to the graceful movements of the maid pouringwater. There is an isolated preliminary study for this figure that tells us a great deal about Ghirlandaio's method of drawing using a network of parallel hatching"

06450-21novemb.jpg	The Return of the Herd is one of a cycle depicting the months, five paintings of which have survived. This picture presumably depicts November.Many of Bruegel's paintings show people not so much as the masters of nature but rather as a part of it: there is hardly any difference here between the coloration of the cattle and that of their drovers. November is the month in which the cattle return to their winter quarters from the summer pastures and Bruegel shows them being driven towards the hill-top village. In this panel Bruegel's remarkable technique can be studied at its best. Individual forms are built up with the greatest economy. Within the sketched outline the paint is laid on thinly, sometimes with an almost dry brush. The light brown gesso underpainting is allowed to show through, in this instance giving a warm brown tone to the whole foreground. Bruegel must have composed the Months largely on the panels themselves; only one preparatory drawing on paper survives, a study for one of the hunters in The Hunters in the Snow, the January panel. Having prepared the panel, Bruegel drew the outlines of the composition in paint with a thin brush and then added the thinly-scraped areas of colour within those outlines

42055-pitti.jpg	The picture shows the general view looking towards the north and west walls in the Sala Terreno (called the Room of Giovanni da San Giovanni) in the summer quarters of Ferdinando II de' Medici on the ground floor in the Palazzo Pitti.The Palazzo Pitti in Florence, purchased from the Pitti family by the wife of Duke CosimoI de' Medici in 1549 and renovated and expanded by Bartolommeo Ammanati, served as a residence of royal proportions for roughly 350 years. It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno). Its virtuoso wealth of forms, the scenographic bravura of its architectural painting, and its strikingly original programmatic concept, makes the room an outstanding example of seventeenth-century Florentine painting, standing as it does between tradition and modernism. The east wall of the Salone and the ceiling was painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1635-36, the south wall by Cecco Bravo in 1638, the west wall by Ottavio Vannini in 1639-41, and the north wall by Francesco Furini in 1640-42.The wall paintings deal with Lorenzo de' Medici and the return of the Golden Age under his rule

24165-2rakoczi.jpg	This portrait of Ferenc R�k�czi II is not only the most beautiful example of Hungarian baroque portrait-painting but also one of M�nyoki's most outstanding works. It is the finest memento of the Prince, splendidly conveying his distinction of mind and body, his pride, his dignity, his nobility.Born into the Transylvanian nobility, R�k�czi received a modern education from the Jesuits under the watchful supervision of the Court in Vienna. His studies at the Jesuit schools in Neuhaus and Prague were complemented by travel in Italy where he spent lengthy periods in several large cities and developed a knowledge and appreciation of art. By employing the services of �d�m M�nyoki, he hoped to establish a court art of his own, equal to that of other European courts, and to propagate at the same time his political endeavours through art. These considerations prompted him in 1709 to send his court painter to the Netherlands to study Dutch painting.In his portrait of R�k�czi M�nyoki made use of all that he had learned in the Netherlands. The picture dates from 1712 and was painted in Gda&#241;sk, Poland, to which country the Prince had emigrated after the defeat of the War of Independence led by him. He is depicted in Hungarian costume adorned with embroidery on the front. The strong light on his face and the contrasting dark hair and fur-cap serve to emphasize the features, thus revealing the artist's sensitive understanding of the Prince's character. It is evident that M�nyoki's study of Dutch portrait-painting had taught him how to produce consistent effect of light and tone and to create a pictorial balance whilst at the same time achieving a subtle degree of characterization in his portraits. In this painting of the exiled Prince the artist has merely hinted at the symbols of royalty. The scarlet dolman worn like a cloak and fastened at the front with a chain of Hungarian goldsmith's work, is lined with ermine, as befitted a royal personage. Round his neck the Prince is wearing the Order of the Golden Fleece, awarded in 1709.

33035-09leo_x.jpg	One of Raphael's greatest masterpieces, possibly the only work he executed without help during his last years, is the Portrait of Pope Leo X and Cardinals Luigi de' Rossi and Giulio de' Medici (later to become Pope Clement VII), both relatives of the Pope.This group portrait (which created a sensation, notwithstanding the existence of precedents) is focused on the central figure of the Pope. The two Cardinals, Luigi de' Rossi on Leo's right and Giulio de' Medici on his left, act as a royal escort. An illuminated prayer book lies open on the table in front of Pope Leo. On the same table rests a finely carved bell. Both objects undoubtedly reveal the exquisite tastes of the Pope who was an active patron of the arts.Perhaps those who connect Raphael's name only with beautiful Madonnas and idealized figures from the classical world may even be surprised to see this portrait. There is nothing idealized in the slightly puffed head of the near-sighted Pope, who has just examined an old manuscript (somewhat similar in style and period to the Queen Mary's Psalter). The velvets and damasks in their various rich tones add to the atmosphere of pomp and power, but one can well imagine that these men are not at ease. These were troubled times, for at the very period when this portrait was painted Luther had attacked the Pope for the way he raised money for the new St Peter's. It so happens that it was Raphael himself whom Leo X had put in charge of this building enterprise after Bramante had died in 1514, and thus he had also become an architect, designing churches, villas and palaces and studying the ruins of ancient Rome.The uniform tone of colour, expressed in various red nuances; the quiet atmosphere, alluding to the power of the Pope and the splendour of his court; and the compositional harmony, make this portrait one of the most admired and significant works of Raphael

24110-96samson.jpg	"From 1490 onwards, Mantegna produced a series of illusionistic works representing sculptural reliefs in marble or bronze. These are in grisaille, light and dark tones of a single colour creating figures that stand against a background simulating boldly patterned marble. In Italy, pictures like this, which appear to be carved in stone, were first seen in the bases of Giotto's frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua, where he illustrated the seven Virtues and seven Vices. At the end of the 15th century, grisaille work was in great demand, and Mantegna painted a number of pictures in this technique, including Samson and Delilah, a small masterpiece from a series illustrating the theme of ""women's wiles."" This was a series of stories that had been retold in images since antiquity, stories that supposedly illustrated women's cunning.Samson is the heroic figure with superhuman strength whose story is told in the Old Testament Book of Judges. His wife Delilah was to find the secret of his strength After he told her that the secret lay in his hair, Delilah cut his hair off and the Philistines were able to capture Samson and blind him. The grapevine entwined round the tree is a symbol of Samson's drunken stupor. The inscription carved in the tree trunk warns that women are more wicked than even the Devil."

22555-0view0.jpg	The picture shows a view into the Strozzi Chapel off the right transept of the church of Santa Maria Novella. In the niche behind the altar table is the tomb of the donor, Filippo Strozzi, above it on the altar wall, an allegorical pictorial program referring to the donor. In the stained-glass window a Madonna and Child and Philip and John as the chapel's patron saints are represented, in the vaulting compartment Adam and the serpent are depicted.The painting on the window wall is nothing at all like the sort of decor that was customary in family chapels. Lacking the bright colours of the stained-glass window and the pilasters on either side, these paintings recede into the background, and the contrast between their monochrome tones and the vivid stories on the side walls makes sit obvious that this pictorial program relates to the iconography of the tombs. Only selected motifs - the angels, for example, and some of the ornamental details - are painted in colour, and these stand out dramatically against the painted architecture. The painted columns on either side of the pointed-arched window stand atop high pedestals that flank the round arch above the tomb. The spandrels above that arch are filled with puzzling paintings in grisaille: in each one a winged youth stands with one foot on a skull and holds out another skull in his hand. Although it is impossible to know exactly what these mean, there is no doubt that they have to do with the presence of the donor's tomb directly below them.The theological virtues Fides and Caritas adorn the pedestals beneath the projecting columns on either side of the window. On the left, two putti playing instruments accompany a seated female figure identified by an inscription as Parthenice.There is a pair of women with masks of tragedy and comedy next to the right pilaster and above the inscription DEO MAX. They can be identified as Muses

The painting has in its present condition been overpainted in some places and has lost some of the paint layer.The painting was also called the Madonna Benois because of the family who owned it.

30697-paolina7.jpg	Between 1542 and 1548 Pope Paul III transformed a series of rooms on the two upper levels of the Castel Sant'Angelo into a comfortable and at the same time impressive apartment. Time and again this castle had provided protection to popes against the incursions of secular powers, and it continued to have a military function. His predecessors had commissioned various decorations, although these have been lost. The newly decorated rooms were to provide leisure and spiritual rest - the typical purpose of a country house or villa. The mythological subjects with which some of the rooms were painted - such as the overtly erotic depictions of the story of Cupid and Psyche in the frieze of the bedchamber - thus correspond to what one would expect in a villa, but hardly in papal apartments

Forces of the Kingdom of England and the Duchy of Burgundy occupied Guyenne and northern France, including Paris, the most populous city, and Reims, the city in which the French kings were traditionally crowned. His political and military position improved dramatically with the emergence of Joan of Arc as a spiritual leader in France.

15313-port_wom.jpg	Although the identification of the sitter remains unknown, the attribution of the portrait to Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger has been resolved on the basis of the elaborate inscriptions. A similar type of calligraphy is found on a number of works all by the same hand dating from the 1590s. These accord with the style of painting and the inscriptions on signed and dated portraits by the artist which come from the later part of his career. Gheeraerts was an important and popular painter of Netherlandish origins who achieved success towards the close of Elizabeth I's reign and was retained by Anne of Denmark, the wife of James I.Portrait of a Woman is a typical example of Elizabethan allegorical portraiture. The symbolism, which is clearly of some complexity, embraces the tree, the stag, the flowers, even the birds and the sitters costume. The long-haired figure wears pearls attached to her wrist and a pendant with a miniature around her neck. The inscriptions on the present work, especially the verses in the cartouche to which those in Latin are related, allude to the mood of melancholy that dominates the portrait, but do not indicate the name of the sitter. Her pose is hieratic and her stance somewhat unsteady, but there has been an attempt to set the figure against a landscape as opposed to an interior which is more usual in Gheeraerts work. The portrait has not survived in good condition and the total effect is therefore not as grand as the artists famous Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I, known as the Ditchley Portrait (London, National Portrait Gallery)

34123-scholasti.jpg	Jean Restout had a tremendously successful career and he exercised an influence, through a long life, which links him to the revival of history painting as a school for morals and virtue in the later years of the eighteenth century.The Death of St Scholastica, signed and dated 1730 was commissioned for a monastery at Bourgueil, not far from Tours, and is the companion picture to an Ecstasy of St Benedict. These two pictures represent an expressive extreme not often attempted by French art and best paralleled perhaps in some of Michel-Ange Slodtz' sculpture, for example the St Bruno. Combined with the prominent, hypnotically detailed floorboards and observation of the wood grain of the desk, the collapsed figure of St Scholastica dissolves like a dying flame. Restout created a highly personal masterpiece.Most of Restout's contemporaries had to execute at least some religious paintings but, apart from Subleyras, none equalled his intense, artistic conviction

03424-13jerome.jpg	Although he worked mainly in his native Bassano (from where he gets his name), away from the main artistic centres, Jacopo Bassano played an active role in the cultural life of the time. Pupil of Bonifacio Veronese and student of Titian, Pordenone, Lorenzo Lotto and Savoldo, and an admirer of German engravings, he was inspired by Mannerism and by Parmigianino in particular. He developed and refined a style where a polished use of colour turns Mannerist preciosity into an extreme realist representation, achieving in his later works a sensibility which prefigures the 17th century. The striking naturalism of St Jerome belongs to the beginning of this late period.The saint is portrayed in meditation in the cave which was his refuge and behind which we can glimpse on the right the rain-swept countryside. The livid autumn twilight highlights with realistic truth every vein and wrinkle of the body consumed by a life of privation and picks out the details of the objects on the ground: the hour-glass, the leather-bound volumes, the skull rolled into the shadow. The rare patches of colour pulsate with a shimmering brightness in the play of light and shadow on the dark brown of the rock, conveying the everyday truth of the melancholy of the place and the time of day. The expressive freedom of colour and effects of light inspired El Greco during his formative years in Venice although the artistic visions of the two painters were very different. In fact, for Bassano effects of colour and light are essential to achieve a material reality, while for El Greco they are the fundamental elements of his stunning abstract precepts

42906-2view1.jpg	"Around 1560-61, Veronese was commissioned by Daniele Barbaro to provide the interior frescoes for Barbaro's Palladian villa in Maser. The construction of the villa to a design by Andrea Palladio was completed around 1558. The decoration reflects the taste of Daniele Barbaro, a cultured humanist, and his brother Marcantonio.Veronese decorated six rooms in the 'piano nobile' (the main floor) of the villa, as well as one wall of the last room of the eastern suite of rooms. The piano nobile is laid out in the shape of a double ""T"", the decorated rooms are: the Sala dell'Olimpo, the Sala a Crociera, the Stanza dell'Amore Coniugale, the Stanza di Bacco, the Stanza del Cane, the Stanza della Lucerna. The spacious Sala a Crociera (Cross-Shaped Room) connects the front and the two rooms to the south (the Stanza dell'Amore Coniugale and the Stanza di Bacco) with the large square room (the Sala dell'Olimpo) that opens onto the internal garden to the north. At the sides of the Sala dell'Olimpo are located  the rooms facing onto the courtyard (the Stanza del Cane and the Stanza della Lucerna).The frescoed scenes in the six rooms are supported and framed respectively by a system of decoration that, along with the white stuccoed molding of the door frames and fireplace, is not insignificant in determining the overall impression of the space. Floor to ceiling marble columns or pilasters subdivide the walls in all the rooms. In between, beyond low parapets, one catches sight of far-off landscapes seen from high vantage points that compete with the views from the villa's windows"

10935-annuncia.jpg	The two panels in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, representing the angel and the Virgin of the Annunciation, respectively, were part of a multi-storied polyptych commissioned in 1506 for the high altar of the Benedictine abbey church of San Gerolamo della Cervara, near Genoa			
24437-distrib.jpg	"This episode is taken from the account in the Acts of the Apostles (4: 32-37 and 5:1-11) : ""For as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need....But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?. . . why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost.""Masaccio brings together the two moments of the story: Peter distributing the donations that have been presented to the Apostles and the death of Ananias, whose body lies on the ground at his feet. The scene takes place in a setting of great solemnity, and the classical composition is constructed around opposing groups of characters.No scholar has ever doubted that the entire scene is by Masaccio, except for minor cases of details having been retouched, such as certain parts of Ananias's body, small sections to the far left where the colour had come off, and even tiny areas on St Peter himself.The recent restoration has provided us with interesting information: for example, we can now see that there are several details that are not the work of Masaccio, such as St John's pink cloak and his tunic, and Ananias's hands. It was suggested that all these elements were repainted by Filippino Lippi, all in one day's work, over Masaccio's original fresco.As well as a reference to salvation through the faith, this fresco has also been interpretedas another statement in favour of the institution of the Catasto, for the scene describes both a new measure guaranteeing greater equality among the population and the divine punishment of those who make false declarations. And it has also been suggested that the fresco contains a reference to the family who commissioned the cycle: the man kneeling behind St Peter's arm has been identified as Cardinal Rinaldo Brancacci, or alternatively as Cardinal Tommaso Brancacci.Due to the interference of the altar and marble balustrade set up in the l8th century, no scholar had been able to notice that the two episodes on the end wall are ideally part of a single composition, although they are intended to be seen from different viewpoints: the Distribution of Alms along the corner axis of the building in the centre, from a position to the right of the entrance, while the scene of Peter Healing the Sick with his Shadow is intended to be viewed from the middle of the chapel, from fairly close up. The connection between the two scenes is further emphasized by the fact that on the window side neither has pilaster strips framing the outer edge. The original two-light window, so narrow and tall, did not really interrupt the continuity of the wall space: on the contrary, its concave surface provided an ideal connection with the space outside, not as a further background element, but rather as a real source of light, enhancing the three-dimensional features of the characters and contributing to the contrast between light and dark areas"

04189-catherix.jpg	This fresco is from the church of San Satiro, Milan. After its discovery in 1865, the fresco cycle to which this work belongs was detached and progressively moved to the Brera during the late nineteenth century.Similar to the St Catherine of Alexandria, this composition shows its refinements in the architectural framework rather than in the ornamentation of the subject. The figure of the saint is harmoniously constructed, with her arms in subdued counter-movement, one lightly bent and the other extended. The turn of the head is admirably shown and harmonizes with the movement of the body. Incorporeal, Agnes emerges as if freeing herself from the large, circling folds of her dress, which is much lighter and more diaphanous than the silk of the big sleeves. She appears to emerge not only from the sumptuous garb but also from the niche in which she stands. Her hand touching the pilaster decorated with intarsia emphasizes the three-dimensional space of the architectural background

36066-1view1.jpg	The Oratorio di San Giovanni Decollato in Rome houses the most important fresco cycle executed in the difficult decades after he Sack of Rome. It was commissioned by the Florentine confraternity of the Misericordia, founded in 1488, whose members had set themselves the task of helping those sentenced to death by providing them with spiritual support. Shortly after its founding the confraternity began the construction of the church and oratory next door. The completion of the church was delayed until 1553. By around 1536, on the other hand, the oratory had been completed to the extent that the painted decoration of the room could begin.The subject chosen for the fresco cycle, which covers the upper half of all four walls, was the story of the patron saint of the brotherhood, John the Baptist. For the execution of the cycle they selected Florentine (or Tuscan) artists working in Rome at the time. The most renowned Florentine painter active in Rome was Perino del Vaga, and several preparatory drawings for the frescoes by him have been preserved. Perino's designs were executed by younger Florentine artists, Jacopino del Conte and Cecchino (Francesco) del Salviati.Jacopino del Ponte painted on the entrance wall St John the Baptist Preaching (1538, on the left) and the Baptism of Christ (1541, on the right), on the right wall The Annunciation to Zachariah (1536-38). Salviati painted the Visitation (1538), the Birth of St John the Baptist (1551, on the right wall). The sixth fresco, the Arrest of St John the Baptist (c. 1543, on the left wall) was executed by Battista Franco, who came from Venice but worked in Florence. Pirro Ligorio painted the Feast of Herod with the Dance of Salome (1544-53, on the left wall). Starting in 1550, Salviati painted two apostles on the altar wall, Andrew (to the left of the altar) and Bartholomew (to the right). The altarpiece, an excellent panel with the Descent from the Cross was painted by Jacopino (1550-53). The fresco cycle was completed in 1553 with the Beheading of St John the Baptist. This was carried out by an assistant who reused some of Salviati's older drawings for several figures but whose overall composition did not come close to approximating the achievements of his master.The rivalry between Jacopino and Salviati, reported by Vasari, led to interruptions in the realization of the decorative program.The picture shows the view of the oratory towards the altar

33485-03histor.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 478.This imaginary portrait, one of Rembrandt's best-known works, was painted for Don Antonio Ruffo, a wealthy Sicilian nobleman and Rembrandt's only foreign patron, who had asked Rembrandt for a portrait of a philosopher. The artist sent the painting to Messina (Sicily) in 1654. He was paid 500 Dutch florine (gulden) for it.Rather than choose a single figure, the enormously inventive artist found a way to present three of the great men of antiquity: Aristotle, Homer, and Alexander the Great. Aristotle, the great Greek philosopher of the fourth century B.C., is shown in his library dressed in the robes of a Renaissance humanist. He rests his hand on a bust of Homer and wears a splendid chain bearing a medallion of Alexander the Great, who had at one time been Aristotle's pupil. The figure of Homer was certainly based on one of several Hellenistic busts owned by Rembrandt; the figure of Aristotle is reminiscent of Rembrandt's portraits of the Jews of the Amsterdam ghetto, whom he had often used as models in his biblical paintings. The solemn stillness of Aristotle's study, the eloquence of his fingers resting on the bust of the blind poet, and above all the brooding mystery in his face unite to communicate an image of deep thought

19071-merr_com.jpg	"Dirck Hals was apprenticed to his older brother Frans. Yet while Frans Hals specialized in portraiture, Dirck Hals concentrated primarily on genre paintings and conversation pieces in the manner of Esasias van de Velde and Willem Pietersz. Buytewech. From the 1620s onwards, he frequently had the figures in his paintings added by his own specialist, Dirck van Deelen. He preferred a courtly setting and noble society, whereas his Merry Company follows in the tradition of the brothel painting and the tale of the prodigal son.The bed on the left in the background, and the body language of the couples leave us in little doubt as to the situation. At the same time, however, this is also a ""five senses"" scene: not only is the sense of touch satisfied, but there is also music and singing, smoking and drinking, while the eyes feast on an empty jug or a bodice.The interior also gives us an idea of how paintings were displayed in Holland at the time. They have been hung on a shabby wall without any evident system: a landscape, a marine painting, a portrait. It is clear that paintings had by now become objects to be taken for granted. Some might be cheaper or more expensive, better or worse painted than others, but they were no longer laden with iconographic significance"

04898-poruyter.jpg	Michiel de Ruyter (1607-1676) was one of the most famous admirals in Dutch history. He is most famous for his role in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century. His victories in the naval battles of the Dutch War of Independence and later during the Anglo-Dutch wars assured his place not only as a national hero, but also as one of the most respected admirals in history. His greatest military achievement was the Four Days' Battle of June 1666, which resulted in defeat for the English navy. De Ruyter was then asked to commission his own portrait in six copies, to be hung in the chambers of the regional offices of the admiralty in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg, Harlingen, Enkhuizen and Hoorn.The commission to execute the portraits was awarded to Ferdinand Bol. Six almost identical copies of the official portrait of the commander-in-chief of the Dutch fleet were therefore made, of which four are still known today.In the portrait De Ruyter is shown in three-quarter length, dressed in ceremonial attire with gold buttons and a thick gold belt, holding his admiral's baton. Around his neck he wears the chain of the Order of Saint Michael. His arm is resting on a celestial globe made by the celebrated Blaeu Company. The fleet appearing in the background of the portrait was executed by Willem van de Velde the Younger. As was common practice in the studios of the time, such traditional details in portraits of naval commanders were generally executed by artists who specialized in marine scenes

42225-0211vela.jpg	The pictures Vel�zquez produced in Italy include the large Forge of Vulcan. The god of fire and his assistants are working a red-hot piece of metal in the forge, which is grey with dust, and another journeyman is making a suit of knightly armour, its materiality depicted with a masterly touch, when Apollo the god of light makes his entrance, rather like the youthful hero in a provincial farce - yet radiant as his appearance may be, he brings Vulcan unwelcome news: at this very moment, as we know from mythology, Vulcan's wife Venus is keeping an amorous tryst with Mars, the god of war.The half-naked figures, shown in richly graduated flesh tints and not, as in the Bacchus, pressed close together in a dense group, are depicted in postures noticeably influenced by sixteenth-century Italian masters. Although large areas in earthy colours are still reminiscent of Caravaggio, the greater vigour of the brushwork and the red of Apollo's robe, which is suffused with light, suggest those models now admired by Vel�zquez: Tintoretto, the Venetian master of colour, and in particular Titian

Vasari mentions other works by Benozzo Gozzoli during his stay in Rome, which are mostly lost or destroyed. However, the Madonna and Child Giving Blessings, painted on silk, still exists in Santa Maria sopra MInerva.Benozzo has placed the Madonna standing in frontal view, common in the early Middle Ages, within an architectural framework. The dark blue cloak of the Mother of God is draped across the balustrade, thus creating the impression that she is about to step out of the ciborium.

25205-resurrec.jpg	We know nothing about this master, and have to deduce everything from his pictures. He was named after his principal work, the former altarpiece in the Augustinian Canons' church in Wittingau, now Trebon, in southern Bohemia. Its high altar was consecrated in 1378; the altarpiece was perhaps already completed at this point, or finished soon afterwards. The Master of Trebon must certainly have been active by no later than 1395, since the J�r�n epitaph of this date makes clear stylistic references to his art. His paintings for Wittingau coincided with the reform of the monastery, in which the emperor played an active role. Hence, too, it is suspected that his workshop was in Prague, rather than in southern Bohemia. The master employed assistants on the Wittingau Altar. He had a large workshop and was extremely influential in his own day We can only speculate about his artistic origins. He shows no evidence of any links with Italian art. His starting-point was undoubtedly older Bohemian painting. The Master of Trebon may also have been influenced by Franco-Flemish panel painting. In his innovative interpretation of subject and composition, and above all as a colourist, the Master of Trebon is outstanding amongst the artists of central Europe between 1350 and 1400.The retable which once stood on the high altar of the Augustinian Canons' church in Trebon today survives only in fragments. It is nevertheless clear that the Resurrection panels, formerly visible on the weekday side of the altar, is the work of a master of European standing. The intensity with which the artist has re-thought and re-interpreted his subject is also clear. The risen Christ has floated through and out of the closed and sealed tomb. We are shown not the moment of resurrection, but the state of being resurrected. The painter presents the event as a true miracle. The watchmen fix their eyes on the apparition as if entranced

18605-2view1c.jpg	"This panel, also known as ""Concert of Angels and Mary in Glory"", is the central panel of the second view of the Isenheim Altarpiece. In the iconography relating to Mary, the concert of angels can accompany the Glorification as well as the Nativity.The musician angels are crowded into the Gothic chapel which fills the left half of the painting. In fact only three of them have instruments in their hands, and only one of them stands out, a blond-haired angel dressed in pale violet robe kneeling and playing the viola da gamba. His exalted expression and his beautiful instrument, however, fill the entire picture with music. The peculiar position of his hand, the way he holds the bow at the wrong end, is certainly not in accordance with contemporary practice; it is merely a compositional solution employed by the master. Behind him we can see one of his mates playing the viola da braccio, and on the left, behind the column, another bird-like, feather-covered angel who also plays the viola da gamba. Gr�newald no longer makes the distinction between the nine orders of angels, but refers to their former hierarchy by depicting them as different.A long-haired female figure, wearing a crown and surrounded by a halo, appears in the doorway of the chapel. She is perhaps a female saint or, according to more recent interpretations, Mary herself before giving birth. The crystal jug on the steps symbolizes her, and the tub and towel refer to the bath to be given the newborn.Mary, lovingly embracing her child, occupies the right half of the painting. She is flooded with heavenly light originating from God the Father, in which angels flutter around. In the rear on the right we can see the two angels bearing the news to the shepherds. The garden in which Mary sits is a walled-in ""hortus conclusus"" (enclosed garden) with closed gates. The plants - the rose and the Tree of the Knowledge, the fig tree - also symbolizes Mary.This altarpiece inspired Paul Hindemith, one of the most significant German composers of the 20th century, to create his opera and symphony entitled ""Mathis the Painter"""

32434-aeneas.jpg	The nineteenth-century inventories list this painting with an attribution to Vouet, while later inventories reflect a modification of the attribution to Alessandro Turchi. Assigned in 1916 to Mattia Preti, the canvas is considered one of the best of the Calabrian painter's youthful works. The painting, dated to the fourth decade of the century, represents Preti's first ambitious attempt to distance himself from the Manfredian models of his youth. At the same time, the Roman neo-Venetian experience, which would prove fundamental to his development as a painter, is just beginning to manifest itself.This painting is a key work for the study of Preti, as it shows him in a delicate moment of stylistic passage. Abandoning his earlier predilection for genre scenes set in a closed room with artificial light, Preti is for the first time attempting a forceful history picture in an open, outdoor setting. The brilliant chromatic range, all based on primary colours, was revealed by a recent restoration. The vibrant blue of Aeneas' mantle, the yellow of his tunic and the resplendent white of the drapery that covers Ascanius remind us that Preti had already encountered the art of Poussin and the neo-Venetian ambient in Rome.The epic subject, taken from the Aeneid, depicts the flight of Aeneas from Troy after the defeat and sack of the city by the Greeks. With his son Ascanius at his side, he carries his old and infirm father Anchises on his shoulders. Anchises clutches the penates, the household gods. In the narrative Aeneas' wife Creusa here set in the margin of the composition, would be lost and killed in the confusion of the flight.This subject found a new popularity at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries, notably through the enthusiasm of Cardinal Scipione Borghese. The connections, emphasized by Virgil and Ovid, between the flight of Aeneas and the founding of Rome had obvious appeal to the modern Romans. Ascanius, according to legend, would grow up to found the city of Albalonga, where Rome's own founders Romulus and Remus were born

37302-7altomon.jpg	In 1326 Filippo di Sanguineto, Count of Altomonte and an Anjou Court dignitary, came to Siena as part of the retinue of Charles, Duke of Calabria, the heir to the throne of Naples. When the Duke later left Tuscany, Count Filippo stayed behind as a royal deputy; his task was to keep under control the animosity of the Ghibelline forces, led by the very bellicose Castruccio Castracani. It seems quite likely that during his stay in Siena the Lord of Altomonte met the artist who had given such a masterly portrayal of the Anjou of Naples and of Hungary on the walls of the Lower Church in Assisi and in the Naples Altarpiece commissioned by King Robert. So he presumably seized this opportunity to commission a small painting himself, probably a diptych; the little panel showing St Ladislaus, King of Hungary, now in the Museo della Consolazione in Altomonte, was probably part of that diptych.The choice of St Ladislaus is perfectly justified by the ties of loyalty that bound Filippo di Sanguineto to the Hungarian branch of the House of Anjou, a loyalty which will later play an important role in the dynastic conflicts. Although the spatial construction of this small panel is very close to that of the Blessed Agostino Novello Altarpiece, the volumes are deeper and there is a wider range of colour. The gold background, with its elaborate and delicate etching, surrounds the saint; standing in a rigidly frontal position, armed with his battle-axe, he reminds us of his valour and his heroic actions in war

32892-1expuls1.jpg	In the Stanza di Eliodoro Raphael enhances his compositions by breaking up the symmetry and the enclosed rhythm of the Stanza della Segnatura with more lively and colourful effects. These trends appear first in the Expulsion of Heliodorus.The focal point of the scene is no longer at the centre. Rather, it is shifted to the right. Here Heliodorus and his followers, profaning the Temple of Jerusalem, are driven out by an armed rider and by two running figures. In the depiction of the rider and the two hovering youths, Raphael follows the text from Maccabees in the Apocrypha exactly. The horse owes a debt to Leonardo's design for the Battle of Anghiari in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.In the centre, the expanse of the wide nave, illuminated by the reflections of light in the vault, is a more effective space-determining motif than the large patches of blue sky which appeared through the coffered ceiling in the School of Athens.At the extreme left, Pope Julius II dominates the bystanders, and he reappears in subsequent scenes as well.Raphael's new compositional formula, so unexpected after the extremely controlled compositions of the Stanza della Segnatura, is visible in all its dynamic evidence from this fresco onward

03877-165portr.jpg	"The portrait, the largest of Bellini's portraits, was probably painted around 1501, the year in which this aristocrat rose to the dogate. The age of the person portrayed, who held office from the age of sixty-five to eighty-five, does not indeed allow to it to be any later. The teaching of Antonello da Messina had clearly been absorbed in the subtle realism of the facial wrinkles and the garments and, even before this, in the sitter's three-quarter turn, rather than the profile pose which was prescribed by dogal iconographical tradition and also adopted by Gentile Bellini.The artist s progress from the early portraits is apparent, and particularly from the still pre-Antonellian Portrait of J�rg Fugger, fixed and linked as it is to the analytical realism of late-Gothic art. In this figure, that fixity now assumes the quality of an emblem of his own highest dignity of office: a ""denaturalization"" almost that crystallizes, but does not dim, the psychological make-up of this highly cultivated man, even in spite of the fact that he is rendered with solemn detachment. Any psychological excess or a too penetrating individualization were prohibited in the name of official and hierarchical decorum. For this reason the portrait finishes by being placed in a line that is consistent more with the Venetian portraiture tradition than with the revolutionary and hyper-real portraits of Antonello da Messina"

41991-driving.jpg	The history of this painting has been traced back as far as 1666, when it was mentioned as part of the Spanish royal collection. In the first years of the nineteenth century Napoleon's uncle Cardinal Fesch added it to his boundless collection, acquiring it in all likelihood through the standard Napoleonic method of collecting by plunder. Upon the dispersal of the Fesch possessions in a series of sales in the 1840's, this important painting entered the collection of the Monte di Piet&#224;, from which it passed to the National Gallery in 1895.The attribution to Valentin (1845) has been followed by all successive critics. The close dependence of this French artist on the style of Caravaggio extends even to the copying of individual passages like the figure lying on the ground to the left or the fleeing, screaming boy to the right. This, as well as, the use of strong light, chiaroscuro, and the realistic definition of the faces suggest a precocious date, perhaps around 1618.Despite the dependence on Caravaggio's style, the complex composition is fundamentally new. Everything is arranged along diagonals, carefully studied to give an overall sensation of whirling motion. Isolated in the centre of all this is the powerful figure of Christ. With his arm raised against a terrorized, fleeing crowd, this figure a very individual interpretation of its prototype, the Christ at the centre of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel Last Judgment

20258-singeri5.jpg	"Singerie is the French word for ""Monkey Trick"". It is a genre depicting monkeys apeing human behaviour, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild satire. Singeries were popular among French artists in the early 18th century, though the term is most usually reserved for a type of decorative painting associated with French Rococo. It originated with the French decorator and designer Jean Berain, who included dressed figures of monkeys in many of his arabesque wall decorations. The emergence of singerie as a distinct genre, however, is usually attributed to the decorator Claude III Audran, who in 1709 painted a large picture of monkeys seated at table for the Ch&#226;teau de Marly. In France the most famous such rococo decor are Christophe Huet's Grande Singerie and Petite Singerie decors at the Ch&#226;teau de Chantilly.The six canvases by Huet, which depict monkeys dressed up as humans and engaged in various country leisure activities, originally formed part of the decor of a salon in the Ch&#226;teau de La Norville. The salon had paneling by the sculptor Nicolas Pineau, which framed the six singeries. In his design, Pineau positioned four of the canvases - The Fishermen, The Dance, The Picnic, and the Concert - as overdoors, while installing the remaining two - The Painter and The Sculptor - above pier glasses"

39459-3lastsup.jpg	"The church of San Giorgio Maggiore was built on the San Giorgio Island between 1566 and 1600 using the design of Palladio. After 1590 the workshop of Tintoretto was commissioned to paint big canvases for decorating it. Due the large number of commissions, Tintoretto in his late years increasingly relied on his coworkers. However, three surviving paintings placed in a chapel consacrated in 1592 - The Jews in the Desert, The Last Supper and The Entombment - were certainly painted by Tintoretto himself.Tintoretto painted the Last Supper several times in his life. This version can be described as the fest of the poors, in which the figure of Christ mingles with the crowds of apostles. However, a supernatural scene with winged figures comes into sight by the light around his head. This endows the painting with a visional character clearly differentiating it from paintings of the same subject made by earlier painters like Leonardo.The curious diagonal position of the table for the Last Supper is explained by the installation of the painting on the right wall of the presbytery of San Giorgio Maggiore. The table was to be perceived by visitors to the church as an extension in perspective of the high altar, or conversely the high altar was to be seen as a prolongation of the table for the Last Supper. The priestly bearing of Christ and the liturgical utensils on the small side table play on the same connection. The winged apparitions characterize the Eucharist as the ""bread of angels"" (St Thomas Aquinas) and in their non-material, other-worldly nature indicate the mystery of transubstantiation (the transformation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ). While the composition of The Last Supper as a whole follows a wall hanging by Giulio Romano depicting the Passover, the detail of the eerily flickering candlestick was suggested by a Crowning with Thorns by Titian (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), which Tintoretto had acquired from the master's estate when he died"

38069-samson.jpg	This picture is considered one of the very few paintings that can be connected to the still problematic Roman period of this artist. On the basis of the parish lists of the church of San Nicola in Arcione, Stom is documented as having been in Rome in 1630-31: a decade of moving around in northern and southern Italy followed, finishing with his definitive move to Sicily in 1641.Stom trained in the workshop that Honthorst established in Utrecht (near Stom's hometown of Amesfoort) upon his return from Rome in 1620. In his earliest works, the younger painter seems to have been most interested in the interpretation of Caravaggesque light effects through the use of artificial light sources. Compared to those of Honthorst, Stom's paintings are characterized by a more vivacious and harsh use of light; and by the more metallic tones in his chromatic range.In Samson and Delilah the artist reduces the scene to its essential elements, setting all of the action in the foreground and organizing it in a triangular composition that is typical of his work. Following Caravaggesque precepts, the point of view is close and Samson's body presses up against the centre of the picture plane. His elbow points towards the spectator, almost transgressing our real space. The highly technical rendering of candlelight, which here originates from a point behind the male figure to the left (who functions almost as a stage-wing), is an interest Stom shares with his master Honthorst. In the later Sicilian works of his last decade Stom would abandon his preoccupation with artificial light, a fact that helps confirm the early date of this picture.

24097-5grisai2.jpg	From 1490 onwards, Mantegna produced a series of illusionistic works representing sculptural reliefs in marble or bronze. These are in grisaille, light and dark tones of a single colour creating figures that stand against a background simulating boldly patterned marble. In Italy, pictures like this, which appear to be carved in stone, were first seen in the bases of Giotto's frescoes in the Arena Chapel in Padua, where he illustrated the seven Virtues and seven Vices. At the end of the 15th century, grisaille work was in great demand, and Mantegna painted a number of pictures in this technique, including two heroines of purity and constancy, Sophonisba and Tuccia. These figures presumably formed part of a larger series.Tuccia, a Vestal Virgin accused of incest, proved her innocence by a feat that was proverbially impossible. After appealing to her goddess for help, she carried water home from the river Tiber in a sieve, and so was rehabilitated through a divine pronouncement. The chiaroscuro tones suggest a classical relief, although Mantegna painted this grisaille without a specific model

25108-2portina.jpg	The young man with very short curly hair, dressed in black, is sitting in prayer towards the left. He is in the corner of a room with a view through a window left and right over a hilly landscape at a lower level. In the left foreground in a kind of fortified inner garden are the Virgin and Child under a lean-to roof, flanked by two angels, one of which is playing a lute. Joseph is drawing water in a jug. The background shows the silhouette of Bruges seen from the Minnewater. In front we see the Minnebrug (bridge) between the two towers, while at the back loom the towers of Our Lady's Church and probably St Donatian's Church.The portrait was ascribed to Memling until the beginning of the 20th century, when the hand of the Master of the Legend of St Ursula was recognized. Since then this attribution has generally been accepted as correct. Technically it is one of the most carefully painted portraits by this contemporary of Memling. Although related to the latter's portraits, the conception here is definitely different. Not a full landscape, but two views on either side, draw the eye into the depth. The lighting too is not at right angles with the surface of the painting, but frontally onto the head and hands, which creates stronger shadows. Both of these distinguishing marks are typical of this minor master. Owing to the size and the red colour of the reverse, the Virgin and Child of the Fogg Art Museum was assumed to be the portrait's counterpiece. This connection has not yet been proved but is quite possible. The nature of the decorative inscriptions on the reverse point in this direction.The sitter was identified as Ludovico Portinari, nephew of Tommaso and brother of Benedetto and Folco, whose portraits were painted by Memling. Ludovico was appointed in Florence in 1479 as the successor to his other uncle Accerito

42206-0105vela.jpg	This painting is one of several early genre scenes by Vel�zquez for which there are no known precedents in Seville. Using a powerful, focused light, itself a novel feature, Vel�zquez creates a tour de force of naturalistic painting in which different shapes, textures, and surfaces are miraculously brought to life.The Old Woman Frying Eggs shows an elderly cook sitting in front of a small clay vessel in which she is cooking eggs over a charcoal fire. The artist's eye has observed and recorded every telling detail, down to the thin sliver of glowing coals that warm the eggs which are absent-mindedly tended by the woman. The worn but fine features of her face, beneath the confident painting of the veil on her head, bear witness to a life well lived. There is a serious, meditative quality about the woman's figure, and the boy with the melon under his arm and a carafe of wine in his hand looks out of the picture at us with comparable gravity. The contrast of youth and age conveys the transience of life, and the egg in the woman's hand suggests associations, familiar at the time, with the mutability of all earthly matter and with another life beyond the grave. The background is dark and indistinct, in contrast to the often over-crowded backgrounds of Dutch kitchen scenes.An interesting feature of this picture, the main subject of which is the cooking of eggs in a clay pot, is the honeydew melon with a cord slung crosswise around it, making it resemble an imperial orb

25975-04passi.jpg	This work is the first in a series of narrative paintings which came to represent an important aspect of Memling's oeuvre. It is a `simultaneous painting' and like the Munich Advent and Triumph of Christ belongs to the landscape-cum-architecture type. Jerusalem features at the centre of the painting as a condensed version of the circular lay-out of a medieval city. Most of the buildings are tower constructions with porticos in a pseudo-Romanesque style topped with domes. These are intended to evoke the exotic character of an Eastern city, while also creating a variety of settings for the action. The overall effect is that of a complex stage set.The viewpoint is very high, as a result of which Calvary is visible above the city and a virtual bird's eye-view is given of the buildings at the bottom. Although consistent one-point perspective is rendered impossible by the varied position of the different buildings, the viewer retains a sense of perspectival unity and logic, from the foreground to the level of the towers, which are ranged squarely across the horizon. In addition to perspectival unity, there is also a spatial unity in the treatment of the scenes and unity of lighting. The latter, in particular, is a rare tour de force in the painting of the period, because the light source is located within the painting and is associated visually with the rising sun on the far right, so that the area located diagonally before it in the front left remains in shadow. Only the donors, who kneel in the corners before the entire spectacle, appear to be immune from this effect. The right-hand part of the architecture, down to a stretch of the crenellated wall at the front, has a pink glow and we see the first, still low rays of the sun reaching the brick gates in the left distance.The Passion cycle is enacted in this setting with the addition of the Resurrection and several of Christ's appearances to his followers, but without the Ascension. This is the first time that Memling applied the spatial narrative structure that he was later to use on two other occasions (Munich and L�beck) to present a Gospel cycle. The narrative meanders symmetrically from the rear left to the foreground and through the principal scene in the middle, before culminating on the right, once again in the distance. Calvary is set somewhat apart as the principal scene in the background. Christ's various appearances after his Resurrection are not particularly significant in iconographical terms, and are probably included as visual links running into the landscape. The painting enabled believers to visit the Holy Places in and around Jerusalem in their imagination. It is a kind of spiritual model of the crusaders' journey.The donors have been identified as Tommaso Portinari, a Florentine banker in Bruges, and his wife Maria Baroncelli on the grounds of their resemblance to bust portraits of the couple painted by Memling.

28443-dunes.jpg	Pieter Molyn was born of Flemish parents in London. Neither the date of his emigration to Holland nor the name of his teacher are known. There is no documentary evidence for the assertion found in the early literature that he studied with Frans Hals, however, he did provide landscapes for a few of Hals's portraits. In 1616 he joined the guild at Haarlem, where he spent most of his life. His earliest works show the influence of Mannerists, such as Bloemart and Savery, but much more important for him was the impact of Esaias van de Velde's art. Van de Velde was active in Haarlem when Molyn joined the guild there. Not much later, Molyn probably met Jan van Goyen, who was sent to Haarlem around 1617 to study with van de Velde.Molyn's innovations are first seen in his modest Dunes, which abandons the device of breaking up a landscape into many layers. Scattered details seen from a low point of view have been subordinated to large areas of light and shadow, and the scene has been unified by prominent diagonals which lead the eye over the dunes past the small figures into the distance

34731-davidbat.jpg	The painting illustrates a biblical passage from the second book of Samuel. King David (looking down from the roof of his palace) fell in love with the beautiful Bathsheba when he saw her bathing and had her brought to him for a lovers' tryst. Soon afterward he sent her husband Uriah to his death, treacherously ordering him to be set in the forefront of the battle, and then married Bathsheba himself. God punished the couple with the death of their first son.The painting is typical of Michele Rocca's work and indicate that his painting, although grounded in the Baroque tradition, resonated more with the emerging French Rococo movement. The size of the composition and its decorative appeal are also characteristic of Rocca's small-scale cabinet pictures of mythological and biblical scenes that gave him his reputation as a small master in eighteenth-century Rome.

44247-interior.jpg	It was in the 15th century, that artists and architects began to make perspective studies for their own sake, inspired mainly by the book of Alberti on painting (1435). Alberti opened his book with an ingenious method for spatial construction based on central perspective. In the 16th century perspective study turned into perspective fantasies in the form of imaginary architecture, often highly elaborate, sophisticated and Mannerist. This interest in perspective and architectural ornament also caused the emergence of painters who began to specialize in this field. One of the inventors in this area was the Dutch painter Hans Vredeman de Vries. He influenced Dirk van Delen, whose follower was Pieter Jansz. Saenredam, one of the greatest master in this field.Emanuel de  Witte was also a great architectural painter. His interiors are always in use, they have a human atmosphere, in contrast with Saenredam's paintings where, if human beings occur, they are small and not at all eloquent, they are just there to measure the spatial dimensions of the building, not to bring it to life as a building that is used

16640-annuncia.jpg	The account books of the most important offices of Siena's medieval municipality had covers made of decorated wooden panels. These were called 'bicherne', named after Bicherna, the financial office that started decorating its manuscripts before any other office did and continued to do so extensively. Production of these decorated book covers started in 1257 and continued until the middle of the fifteenth century. This strange alliance between art and bureaucracy is one of the most original manifestations of Sienese art and involved some of the finest artists.This Annunciation panel comes from the Gabella Generale (general tax office). It shows the Virgin Mary, seated on a chest with her hands joined in prayer and wrapped in a voluminous cloak. The Archangel Gabriel stands before her with his arms crossed and holding an olive branch in one hand, symbolizing peace. In the middle of the painting, between the figures of Mary and the archangel, is a finely worked vase holding a bunch of lilies. They symbolize Mary's purity and virginity. Above the vase, God's blessing hand sends out rays of light that carry the dove of the Holy Spirit toward Mary

14964-tahiti10.jpg	This painting was produced in Paris in the brief period when Gauguin was interested in Symbolism. It depicts a Breton landscape with a naked young woman lying in the foreground. Behind her, a fox, the symbol of lust in Hindu mythology, can be seen. In the background, a wedding procession in Breton costumes is approaching the nude.This was Gauguin's last major work produced before he left for Tahiti at the beginning of April 1891. Although it depicts a Breton scene - the figures in the background are often thought to be an ironical depiction of a wedding party - the work was produced in Paris, using Gauguin's 20-year old mistress, Juliette Huet, whom he left pregnant with his child when he went to Tahiti. The obvious precedent for the reclining female nude was Manet's Olympia, which had finally been bought by the French state.The work is a deliberate attempt at a symbolist painting, produced to appeal to the literary figures who were Gauguin's main supporters at this time. As such, the work is rather laboured in its use of symbolism, in which rather than creating a mood as was more customary, Gauguin has proceeded by a series of easily discernible visual clues. The fox, for example, with his hand on the woman's breast, is both demonic and lubricious, and the red-tipped cyclamen is a reference to the girl's recent defloration

Those whose works have been confused with his include Jacobus Vrel, but now the artistic personalities and special charms of these minor artists are more or less clear. It can be seen that other painters who made views of interiors and street scenes can be associated with the school of Delft by borrowing motifs and making variations on the compositional devices and pictorial refinements of its masters

32209-14massac.jpg	Poussin painted two versions of The Massacre of the Innocents between 1628 and 1632. In the first version, the gruesome scene, in which the mothers are desperately trying to protect their children from the murderous soldiers, unfolds across the pictorial plane like a frieze, with the figures arranged one beside the other. Although Poussin attempts to establish a connection between the three groups, insofar as he presents them as isolated moments within an unfolding sequence of movement, the pairs of figures lack a certain cohesion.Having already suffered greatly in the 1700s, at the beginning of the 20th century the canvas was the target of a politically motivated attack. Its damaged areas could only be partially restored and some clumsy additions were made. It is consequently difficult to date the work, and its attribution was for a long time disputed. In 1994, however, a reference to the painting was discovered in the inventory of a Roman collection of the 17th century, where it is described as a work by Poussin

Thus for the present painting, showing the Roman Forum with the temples of Vespasian and Saturn, the drawing was executed in situ in 1818, and the painting some twenty-four years later in 1842.In the painting, Turpin has borrowed from eighteenth-century landscapists the trick of adopting a low viewpoint in order to accentuate the monumentality of the central ruin, the Temple of Vespasian, which is rendered with great attention to detail.

30505-lan_ruin.jpg	Under Louis XIV, the two main landscape painter of the time were Pierre Patel and Francisque Millet. They were largely derivative in their styles, but this was the secret of their success. Both of them are relatively little known today.Patel derived almost all his ideas and inspiration from Claude, specializing in idyllic classical landscapes, usually with a golden light. His best pictures, such as the example in the Springfield Museum of Fine Arts, are elegant interpretations of Claude, but lack Claude's poetry, being much more akin to the Dutch interpretation of the Italian landscape; and sometimes there is a more antiquarian approach where the ruins are prominent. It was precisely his lack of imagination which brought Patel success he conformed to the accepted standard of landscape format.

40316-205turne.jpg	While in the 'Fighting Temeraire' Turner seemed to deplore the Industrial Revolution, his attitude in this, one of his last great works, is much more ambiguous. The 1840s was the period of 'railway mania' and the restless Turner appreciated the speed and comfort of this form of travel. An unreliable anecdote by Turner's champion, Ruskin, records the origins of this picture in a train ride during a rain storm, during which the artist is supposed to have stuck his head out of the window. Excited as ever by strong sensations, Turner replicates the experience in paint, although the viewer is imagined as seeing the approaching train from a high vantage point. The bridge was, and is, recognisable as Maidenhead Viaduct across the Thames between Taplow and Maidenhead, on the newly laid Great Western line to Bristol and Exeter. Begun on Brunel's design in 1837 and finished in 1839, the viaduct was the subject of controversy, critics of the GWR saying that it would fall down. The view is towards London; the bridge seen at the left is Taylor's road bridge, of which the foundation stone was laid in 1772.Once again Turner relies on Claude for the diagonal recession from foreground to a vanishing point at the centre of the picture. The aims of the two artists, however, are very different. The exaggeratedly steep foreshortening of the viaduct along which our eye hurtles to the horizon is used to suggest the speed at which the locomotive irrupts into view through the driving rain, headlight blazing. Ahead of it, disproportionately large, a hare proverbially swiftest of all animals bounds across the tracks; we doubt if it will win the race and escape with its life. A skiff is on the river far beneath, and in the distance a ploughman stoically turns his furrow. Virtuoso swirls and slashes, and smears and sprays of paint, simulate rain, steam and speed to blur these figures of the old countryside. Exhilaration and regret are mingled with alarm; in a second we must leap aside to let the iron horse roar by

34003-1renoi05.jpg	Renoir and Bazille met in November 1862 in the studio of Charles Gleyre, where they attended drawing classes along with Monet and Sisley. The four pupils quickly became friends and left Gleyre in the spring of 1863 in order to devote themselves entirely to open-air painting. The next summer Bazille moved into a studio in Paris and shared it with Renoir. Toward the end of 1867, Bazille painted his friend in a nonchalant attitude with his feet up on the seat of his chair. The painting remained in Renoir's possession for the rest of his life. Renoir reciprocated by painting a picture of his friend in their studio. Bazille is at his easel, leaning forward slightly with his legs crossed, working on a still-life of dead birds. On the wall behind him is a winter landscape by Claude Monet with a view of Honfleur. The predominant colours in the picture are gray and beige.Despite their differences, one factor is common in these paintings: they depict what appears to be a random moment in everyday life and avoid any semblance of a posed composition

24510-preachin.jpg	"The scene refers to Peter's sermon, as recounted in the Act of the Apostles, which he preaches in Jerusalem after the descent of the Holy Ghost on Pentecost. The fresco actually illustrates the final part of the sermon, when Peter says: ""Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.""It was first suggested in 1940 that Masaccio must have had a hand in this fresco. The three bystanders to the left behind St Peter were attributed to Masaccio (their grim expression is truly modern). However, after the restoration, the cleaning has given such a clear vision of the pictorial fabric that we can now attribute the fresco entirely to Masolino, who was working in total autonomy, following an established division of spaces and subjects, in harmony with the corresponding scene of the Baptism paianted by Masaccio, according to a project that had been drawn up by the two artists together.The fresco is part of the cycle depicting the story of the life of St Peter.

23146-communio.jpg	According to the legend, after the ascension of Christ, Mary Magdalen came to France in a boat with miraculous help, together with her brother and sister and a few other pious people. Here she lived in seclusion for thirty years. To this lonely pilgrim an angel brought the Host and seven times a day angels took her up to heaven. These two events in the life of the Saint are often linked together by painters as in the portrayal by the young Antonio Pollaiolo, whose altarpiece in the church at Staggia was the model for Credi's panel.This painting is a fine example of Lorenzo's late period. By this time the art of Credi is a conservative phenomenon in Florence, and his works were often characterized by the mechanical employment of often repeated stereotypes. The light and softly formed figures of this panel, however, already suggest something of the atmosphere of the High Renaissance

35713-landscap.jpg	In the late 1660s, perhaps inspired by the example of Philips Koninck, Jacob van Ruisdael painted a number of extensive landscapes, of which this is a fine example. Like Koninck, he adopts a high viewpoint, devoting more than half the canvas to a cloud-filled sky. It has been suggested that the church in the centre is that of St Agatha at Beverwijk, about seven miles north of Haarlem, where Ruisdael lived and worked. The tower of that church, however, was different and in any case it is unlikely that Ruisdael was attempting topographical accuracy. The painting was no doubt based on drawings made in the vicinity of Haarlem which Ruisdael then took back to his studio and transformed into an imaginative landscape. There are four other landscapes by Ruisdael which show the same view or part of the same view with small differences of detail

43205-croesus.jpg	After his return from Rome to Paris in 1624, Vignon became enormously prolific; a huge number of pictures, several hundred in all, were documented at the time of his death. As he matured in Paris and lightened his palette a little, Vignon still maintained his sense of drama. For example, in his Croesus Receiving Tribute from a Lydian Peasant, there is a lessening of interest in bizarre surface texture, and the poses of the figures round the table show a return to the conventions of Caravaggism.There is some doubt about the identification of the main figure as Croesus, but the story fits enough. The moral is clear - great wealth is amassed by cruel methods

17022-antwerp1.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 207, JH 979.Conscious of his failure in the field of rural genre, van Gogh decided to return to the city. He planned to go to Paris in the hope that the new movements in Parisian painting, of which he had heard from his brother, might provide him with new directions for his work. To prepare himself for this encounter with Paris and its urban population and motifs van Gogh went to the Belgian port of Antwerp. Some important changes took place in the three months he spent there. He visited the museums and carefully studied the portraiture and colourist palette of Frans Hals, and in a series of experimental portraits, of which the present painting is one, he tried to apply the animated brushwork and juxtaposed colours he had noticed in Hals's painting.Apart from a few sketches of Antwerp's landmarks and scenes in and around the caf�s of the port, van Gogh concentrated on painting portraits. But they were not commissioned portraits: that market was, as he noted, being served by the photographic studios. The model for this portrait was a woman from a caf�-concert, a motif associated with modern city life. But van Gogh has not painted this woman, this social type, in her social setting, or in any context at all. Nor is she presented in an expressive, narrative or sentimental pose as was often the case in van Gogh's earlier images of women from his Hague period, when he used the prostitute Clasina Hoornik as his model

08889-vault.jpg	This photograph was taken before to the 1997 earthquake.The four vault cells, of which the eastern one was destroyed by the earthquake, contain depictions of the evangelists, as was common in the crossing vaults of medieval churches. Borders with double vines, which grow out of vases borne by angels and wrap around heads of putti at regular intervals, line the individual picture fields. The evangelists: St Luke (west vault cell), St John (north cell), St Matthew (east cell) and St Mark (south cell).Either writing or absorbed in scripture, the evangelists occupy one half of each triangular field; a table writing desk is in the middle; and a view of a city is in the other half. In the pinnacle of each vault cell is a patch of cloud from which an angel descends and, as a visual sign of divine inspiration, touches the ear of the evangelist. The cities depicted represent, or once represented, the parts of the world to which each evangelist directed his message: YTALIA, ACCHAIA, ASIA, IUDEA

25114-6michael.jpg	St Michael does not occupy the highest rank in the angelic choir. In the celestial household, however, as one of the seven archangels, he is the leader of the army of angels fighting the demons. In popular imagination it is his army that scatters and chases into outer darkness the rebellious angels who choose to obey Satan rather than God. Here he is not portrayed as a knight in arms but as a fighting priest in clerical attire. The type may go back to an older representation by Jan van Eyck on which Gerard David later based his St Michael altarpiece in Vienna. The Eyckian shape of the shield could also point this way.

13763-david_go.jpg	Fetti was a peripatetic artist. Having been trained in Rome by the Florentine painter, Lodovico Cigoli, he worked at the court of Mantua from around 1613 and towards the end of his life spent some time in Venice. His principal patron was Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga at Mantua and it was with the purchase of the Gonzaga collection in 1625-27 that Charles I acquired a number of works by Fetti. The artist was influenced by Venetian painters, as well as by Elsheimer and Rubens. His portraits and a series of small-scale pictures illustrating parables, probably commissioned by Ferdinando Gonzaga, are perhaps his best works. The artists technique is distinctive, with rapid brushstrokes of pure colour applied as highlights over broader areas of paint on canvases primed with dark tones. Similarly, the poses of his figures and the choice of viewpoints are often unusual.David with the Head of Goliath almost certainly formed part of the Gonzaga collection. A version of some quality is in Dresden (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen) and others are recorded. A date around 1620 has been suggested, that is, before the artist moved to Venice in 1622. The pose is somewhat reminiscent of the Ignudi by Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and it is possible that the painting was meant to be hung as an overdoor.The present work depicts the story of David and Goliath as recounted in the first Book of Samuel, 17:48-51. The shepherd boy, David, defeats Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, in single combat using a sling with a stone. Afterwards David cuts off Goliath's head using the giants own sword. The body of Goliath is visible on the left in the middle distance. Fetti cleverly contrasts the large scale of the decapitated head and sword with David's smaller body.

44697-bullhunt.jpg	"Although clever Zuccarelli was fond of landscapes he always had a slight nostalgia for portraiture. In vain was he stunted and distorted, in vain was he enclosed in his isolation, in vain was this longing suppressed by the freer, fresher and more fluid talent of the born landscape painter; he stood out from among the mass of his fellow artists. He had a talent, rare among landscape painters for portraiture, too. He began his studies in Florence and Rome and then came under the influence of Venice and of Ricci. It was during this period (1732-1751) that he painted his best pictures of the lagoons.Bull-Hunting is connected with a trend akin to Central European or rather French culture (Boucher and Fragonard), in which mythological and Arcadian representations (landscapes and customs) were virtually ""compulsory"". This seems to have been the cultural trend of the period, a culture conveyed by channels that, although not of Italian origin, clearly revealed the deep feelings of the age. The starting-point of the picture is the game of the same name, which took place on the piazza in front of San Polo. Documentary art was the artist's speciality, and accordingly, setting out from this open-air game, he represented his theme in nature, idyllically and, at the same time, solemnly, for this was the subject with which he could display his gifts best."

14946-6pould16.jpg	This picture was painted during Gauguin's stay in Le Pouldu, Brittany. Meyer de Haan (1852-1895) was a Dutch industrialist who sold his factory to his brothers and started to study painting. He settled in France. In Paris he met Pissarro, Theo van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin, whom De Haan accompanied to Brittany - first to Pont-Aven, and later to Le Pouldu, on the coast of Brittany.Things sacred are present in the background of Gauguin's portraits, which he wanted to put in expressive harmony with the faces, according to the Symbolist doctrine which inspired also Van Gogh. Strange anguished faces are whirling around Meyer de Haan in Nirvana. Gauguin regarded things sacred as linked with a darkly virgin and barbaric power.Gauguin depicted Meyer de Haan several times in painting and in graphics.

Socrates was accused by the Athenian government of impiety and corrupting the young through his teachings; he was offered the choice of renouncing his beliefs or being sentenced to death for treason.

13273-nymphs.jpg	The painting is an example of cool, dignified classicism, in which Van Everdingen came close to the art of Poussin.The principal character in the painting is the young man with his foot on a high marble step on the right. He can be identified as the wine god Bacchus by his coronet of vine leaves and the ivy-twined staff in his hand. His left foot rests on two rather puzzling  objects: one is a mask of an elderly man with white locks and a moustache, and the other is the leather skirt of a shiny metal cuirass. The three sparsely-clad young women in attendance on the left are fitting companions for the lusty Bacchus. The nymph opposite Bacchus extends her right arm to offer him a glass of wine. Bacchus reaches out to receive it, taking the stem between his thumb and index finger. This gesture, where one person hands a glass of wine to another, is the central theme of many of Vermeer's and Ter Borch's slightly earlier genre pieces

25985-05nativi.jpg	The composition of this little work is clearly a reprise of the central panel of the Bladelin triptych (Berlin, Staatliche Museen) by Van der Weyden. It has, however, been simplified and the proportions of the figures with respect to the architecture made more natural. The angels have been omitted and the stable transformed into a realistic architectural fragment, according to Memling's custom, with a spatial function that transcends the field of view of the painting. All the typological and iconographical ingredients of the earlier example are otherwise present. We know that this presentation of Mary, dressed in white and suddenly and painlessly praying to her new-born Child, derives from the 'Revelationes' of St Bridget of Sweden (fourteenth century). The way Joseph, holding his candle, is overwhelmed by the divine light also derives from that source, as does the pillar on the left which Mary saw during the birth and which symbolises Christ's flagellation. Memling also retains in his composition the cellar entrance at the front, which might be an allusion to the cave in Bethlehem where Christ was born.It is generally accepted that the painting should be ascribed to Memling and dated to around 1470. The figures do indeed retain the rather stocky frame and rounded physiognomy of the earliest works. Mary is identical to the Ottawa Virgin, which dates from 1472. The little painting also closely resembles the Nativity in the left wing of the Prado triptych in terms of style. A date of around 1470-72 would thus appear likely.The painting, in all probability, have been the central panel of a small triptych with donor wings on either side, or possibly an iconography that was also inspired by the Bladelin triptych. It must have been located in or around Bruges, because it was copied towards the end of the fifteenth century in a small tondo located in St John's Hospital in Damme.The painting is in its original frame.

43993-1bladel.jpg	"The scenes in the side panels depict the advent of the Son of God on earth being announced in miraculous visions to the Roman emperor Octavian (Augustus) and to the three Magi. The Christ Child receives the homage of both East and West, that is to say the whole world as displayed in the panorama of the open triptych: the West is symbolized by the Roman empire - which was regarded as the direct predecessor of the medieval Holy Roman Empire - the East by the Magi, and between them stands the Holy Land with Bethlehem, to the medieval mind the centre and navel of the world.The visions seen by these ruler are taken from a text popular at the time, but never previously illustrated in this form: the chapter on the Nativity in the Legenda Aurea (Golden Legend, a collection of tales of the saints written around 1270 by the Dominican monk Jacobus de Voragine (1228/29-1298). However, there were certain problems involved in illustrating it in realistic detail. It was particularly difficult to present Octavian's vision of the Madonna on an altar hovering in the sky, not borne up by angels or similar figures. Rogier solved this problem by seating the Virgin on an obviously heavy altar, so closely framed by the opening that she looks almost like a picture within the picture, providing an optical focus. The donor clearly wanted the text of the legend illustrated literally, and he must at first have asked for actual quotations too, although they were eventually omitted, to the benefit of the work as a whole: infrared photography shows that all the scenes originally contained scrolls to hold wording. The left-hand picture, for instance, was to quote the words miraculously heard by Octavian, according to the legend, on seeing the vision: Haec est ara coeli (""This is the altar of Heaven""). However, during the execution of the triptych it obviously became clear that the pictures would make their point even without any explanatory text, and the wording was overpainted. Such a decision cannot have been taken without the consent of the patron who commissioned the altarpiece, and perhaps it may have been made during a conversation between Rogier and his client when the latter visited the artist's studio"

37052-3resurr1.jpg	This fresco is located in the first compartment on the right wall.The account of the Apocalypse then continues with three large scenes, the Resurrection of the Flesh, the Damned and the Elect, and two smaller ones on either side of the chapel's window, Paradise and Hell.It is primarily in this section of the fresco cycle that Signorelli has given free rein to his inventive genius. An inventiveness that, as Berenson said, made him one of the greatest of modern illustrators, and thanks to which his art is still an extremely important part of our figurative heritage. Despite the rhetorical devices, the theatrical ruses and the occasional contrived details, despite the limitations in his draughtsmanship and use of colour recognized by all modern critics, there is no denying that never before in Italian art had figurative ideas of such unforgettable power been used. Viewed all together the huge frescoes in the Orvieto chapel give an impression of overcrowding and of confusion which is far from pleasing. We have to isolate the individual details in order to grasp the greatness of Signorelli the 'illustrator' and the 'inventor' and therefore justify Berenson's statement. See, for example, in the Resurrection of the Flesh, the macabre but hilarious idea of the nude with his back to the observer who is carrying on a conversation with the skeletons; or the skulls surfacing through the cracks in the ground, who put on their bodies as though they were a costume, and become human beings once again.

36524-cephalus.jpg	The subject of this painting is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses (Met. 7:795-866). In Greek mythology, Cephalus and Procris are a young couple, newly married, whose love was destined to end in tragedy. Aurora, the goddess of dawn fell in love with Cephalus. He rejected her and she retaliated by planting in him seeds of suspicion concerning his wife's faithfulness. A faun who was in love with Procris mischievously told her that he had overheard Cephalus talking to a secret lover while he was out hunting. To discover the truth Procris followed her husband into the forest and hid in the bushes. Cephalus, hearing the rustling of leaves, threw his spear and killed his wife.The painting depicts the scene of the death of Procris. In his mythological and religious pictures, Schalcken favoured subjects that could be rendered as night scenes. In this genre he was influenced by his teacher, Gerrit Dou, and by Dou's leading disciple, Frans van Mieris the Elder

10237-1venus10.jpg	Renaissance scholars attributed to Theocrites, the 3rd century BC Greek poet, the fable that recounts how Cupid, having been stung by bees when stealing honey, complained to his mother Venus about the pain produced by such small animals. To which she replied that he too was small and that the wounds occasioned by his arrows were much more painful. Cranach knew this text from the translation by his friend Melanchthon, whom he had met in the intellectual circles that he frequented at Wittenberg. The Latin verses at the top of the painting explain the subject. This gave the artist the opportunity to paint nudes, their strong sensuality conflicting with the moralising side of the story. Treated several times by Cranach himself or by his workshop, this mythological subject matched the taste of the Prince-Electors of Saxony, who commissioned these works to decorate their private apartments. The version in Brussels is one of the most successful out of twenty or so known variants.Venus' white, weakly modelled body stands out against a black background in a sinuously seductive pose. The artist's interest in the human body is very superficial, far from the anatomical researches undertaken so passionately by his contemporaries. The few accessories adorning the model, like the heavy red velvet hat or the precious necklace enriched with stones, are clearly added for erotic intent. The light, transparent veil attracts the viewer's attention much more than hiding any nudity. The goddess's oblique glance and almond-shaped eyes increase the equivocal nature of this image. Through the harmony of this drawing, Cranach nonetheless succeeds in transcending this seductive aspect and responds to Theocritus' verses by creating a veritable visual poem in which the fluid lines of the model, of rarely equalled elegance, snake melodiously through space. Alongside Venus, the baby winged Cupid holds the honeycomb that he has just stolen, a source of immediate pleasure but also of pain. Behind him, the uniformity of the dark background is broken by a tree, at the base of which we find the mark of the artist's workshop, taken from the coat-of arms granted to him by the Elector of Saxony: a winged serpent with outspread wings, and the date 1531.

21761-muses.jpg	Le Sueur was the pupil of Vouet. This painting and its companion piece depicting Melpomene, Erato and Polyhymnia were used to decorate the Cabinet of the Muses of the Hotel Lambert in Paris. These charming, delicately painted pictures foreshadow the coming of Poussin.The muses are the goddesses of creative inspiration in poetry, song and other arts, they are the companions of Apollo. They were the daughters of Jupiter and the Titaness Mnemosyne (memory) who had lain together for nine consecutive nights.

31918-flowers2.jpg	Antonio Ponce was an apprentice and, probably, an assistant of Juan van der Hamen who enjoyed a long career at the court of Madrid as a specialist painter of still-lifes and flower pieces. This flower painting, and its pendant in the same private collection, representing glass vases of flowers standing on a stone ledge, follows the most conventional of formats for flower paintings. As flower paintings became important decorative features in the homes of the period, they were increasingly conceived as pendant paintings and, indeed, as decorative series of works. Moreover, the stone ledges on which the flowers rest enter the pictures from opposite sides, a feature that would have permitted their owner to hang them on either side of a central element, such as a window, a painting or piece of furniture, with the perspective of the ledges appearing to converge on a central point.Ponce has meticulously studied the play of light on the petals of the flowers, carefully tracing their edges with thin strokes of white paint and applying highlights as a series of hatched brushstrokes in light paint. Personal factors probably explain the depth of Van der Hamen's influence on Ponce's flower paintings: the older artist was a pioneer in this genre in Madrid and had taught the younger artist to paint. Ponce's faith in the aesthetic principles of Van der Hamen appear to be in direct contrast with the spirited touch exemplified in the works of his younger contemporaries, such as Juan de Arellano and Gabriel de la Corte

19370-51hayez.jpg	Individual and ideal Risorgimento sentiments of love of country provide Hayez, the principal champion of Italian historical romanticism, with his favourite themes.The Sicilian Vespers is the name given to the successful rebellion on the island of Sicily that broke out on the Easter of 1282 against the rule of the French/Capetian king Charles I, who had ruled the Kingdom of Sicily since 1266. The massacre of the French  precipitated a French-Aragonese struggle for possession of that kingdom. Its name derives from a riot that took place in a church outside Palermo at the hour of vespers on Easter Monday, March 30, 1282. Peter III of Aragon, Charles's rival for the Neapolitan throne, conspired to raise a rebellion against him in Sicily. The rising broke out prematurely when Sicilians, incensed by Charles's oppressive regime, killed some insulting French soldiers at vespers in the church of Santo Spirito. The people of Palermo followed suit and massacred 2,000 French inhabitants of the city the night of March 30&#150;31. All of Sicily soon revolted and sought help from the Aragonese, who landed at Trapani on August 30.

36126-philip_2.jpg	During the first half of the sixteenth century Spain acquired a vast empire of distant colonies, but by the end of the century this expansion had ceased. During the years that saw the containment of the Empire Spain was governed by Philip II (1556-1598), the son of the Emperor Charles V. When he came to the throne at the age of twenty-nine he ruled over all the Spanish colonial territories, the Netherlands and a large area of Southern Italy; for a short period he was also a force to be reckoned with in England. But he lived to see the Union of Utrecht - which marked the secession of the northern provinces - and the destruction of the Armada off the shores of England. He did not, however, live to see the successes in Central Europe of the Counter-Reformation, for which he was partly responsible. He was an unhappy man, who bequeathed to his successors a financially depleted country - and a fabulous palace: the Escorial.During the reign of Philip II the Spanish Society was hierarchical, insular and �litist. Its code of honour was based on purity of faith, purity of blood and legitimate birth, and was manifested in the practice of virtue. Philip II himself had introduced a fashion for shorter hair and shorter beards, and for sober dress, particularly black. Considering that S�nchez was a court painter, his portrait of Philip was not very flattering; he tried to combine truth with a show of respect, expressing the personality of the monarch in his painting of the thick lips, the cold blue eyes, the hand fingering the rosary, the ruff and the order of the Golden Fleece

41405-14virgin.jpg	The Virgin, depicted breast-feeding the Infant Christ, bears an inscription to the right other halo with the word Humility - she is the Madonna of Humility who protects the humble under her cloak. This anonymous master of the Venetian school, probably working in the circle of Paolo Veneziano, paints in a transitional style, whereby the lingering influence of Byzantine art can be seen in the decorative treatment of the draperies and the compositional structure of the scene, in which the gold ground prohibits any sense of spatial depth. The faces and the visible areas of flesh are nevertheless painted with a certain solidity and realism which gives the figures a more human feel

38700-flutepl.jpg	There are two related paintings by Terbrugghen in the Kassel Museum: Boy Playing a Fife, and Boy Playing a Recorder. These two paintings can be seen as an early and original appropriation of Caravaggio's realism, which had made such an impression on Terbrugghen when he spent some years in Rome. Back in Utrecht, he became the leading figure among the so-called Caravaggisti who came to dominate the artistic life of the northern Netherlands after 1620. These two paintings already demonstrate the artist's abilities, with the subtle tonal grading of bodies and dress giving the figures materiality and three-dimensionality.Terbrugghen conceived of the two boys as a complementary pair, and although they play similar instruments, they embody opposites. The boy with the fife, in striped soldier's costume, represents the urban and military, while the other, in shepherd's dress, represents the rural and arcadian. The cool blue of the one painting confronts the warm hues of the other.Terbrugghen's two half-length pictures of flute players at Kassel are outstanding examples of the breadth, force and beauty of his pictorial manner. They are also among earliest life-size, half-length Dutch paintings of musicians, a motif that quickly became a staple of Utrecht painters and soon entered the repertoire of other Dutch artists. Terbrugghen made more intricate pictures than the Kassel companion pieces, but he never surpassed their poetic Arcadian mood and delicacy. The effect o f the dark-shadowed flute player before a bright wall in the background is an anticipation of an essential pictorial theme of the Delft School.

06493-09dance.jpg	This panel, which is not dated, was painted at about the same time as The Peasant Wedding, that is, about 1567. The sizes of the two paintings are the same and they may have been intended as a pair or as part of a series illustrating peasant life. They are the two most outstanding examples of Bruegel's late style, which is characterized by his use of monumental Italianate figures.The running and jumping steps of the village-square dance have nothing in common with the formal dances performed at court or in bourgeois circles. Nor do we find here the care for and adornment of one's face customary in more elevated circles, by means of which supposed faults of nature were to be corrected.There is another version of this subject by Bruegel in a painting in the Detroit Institute of Arts. It is dated 1566 and although the surface is rather worn, it is today generally accepted as an authentic work from Bruegel's own hand. The composition is more crowded and in consequence more effective than the Vienna picture.

00634-harpies0.jpg	"Perhaps the most famous work of Andrea del Sarto is the altarpiece painted for the nuns of San Francesco dei Macci, known as the Madonna of the Harpies.According to the contract signed on May 14, 1515 the picture was to depict the Madonna and Child crowned by two angels and flanked by St John the Evangelist and St Bonaventure, and to be delivered within a year. But in fact the work is dated 1517, and shows St John the Evangelist and St Francis on either side of the Madonna and Child on a high polygonal pedestal. The latter is decorated at the corners with monster-like figures (the so-called Harpies), while in the centre, beneath the artist's signature, are the opening words of a hymn to Our Lady of the Assumption. We therefore have not the Coronation of the Virgin but the Virgin of the Assumption.These variations on the original commission, and the subject itself, which is not a traditional Madonna and Child Enthroned between Two Saints, but a highly unusual presentation of the Virgin, full-figure on that enigmatic pedestal with the images of the ""harpies,"" have led to a lot of thought and attempted explanations on the part of all critics. The most recent interpretation is that it is a depiction, based on the text of the Book of Revelations, of the Virgin triumphant over evil, symbolized by the monstrous figures, the ""harpies,"" which are in fact the ""locusts"" mentioned in Revelations; and besides that, bears witness to the cult of the Virgin by the clients, the conventual Franciscans.Having removed the layers of dirt and overpainting, the 1984 restoration has re-established the exceptionally rich colouring of the work, praised by Vasari as being ""of singular and truly rare beauty."" The figure of the Madonna, wrought into a composed chiasmus in order to balance the weight of the Child (who on the other hand is lively, smiling, and as ambiguous as Rosso's putti), lights up the centre of the picture with the intense rose-colour of her robe tempered by harmony with the pale blue of her mantle, and with the brilliant yellow of the light fabric draped over her shoulders beneath the beautiful drapery of the white veil covering her head. On her left is the sculptural St John (painted from a terracotta model by Sansovino) swathed in a cinnabar red mantle linked to the lilac of his robe by means of a highly refined drapery, while on the other side the figure of St Francis strikes a clear note that emerges by subtle varieties of tone from the architectural motif of the background; while in the background one can once more see ""the smoke of transparent clouds veiling the architecture and the figures, that appear to move"" (Vasari): a warm, mysterious halo, made of colours and of shadows, that behind and around the figures impels an atmosphere that implies the rich spiritual message brought to us by this painting.The Madonna of the Harpies is truly a milestone in the career of Andrea del Sarto, and bears witness to the level of maturity of the most significant artistic experiences of the early 16th century: the ""atmospheric"" painting of Leonardo, the meditation recently infused with a new freshness in the ""grandiose"" manner of Michelangelo, the elegant and solemn classicism of Fra Bartolomeo endowed with a new intensity of colour after his stay in Venice, the experience of Raphael's work in Rome (and in this case the Sistine Madonna is usually mentioned); these are all motifs that come together in a single stylistic solution, the greatness of which was immediately recognized in Florence and elsewhere. This general admiration was shared almost two centuries later by Prince Ferdinando de' Medici, who acquired the picture for his collection in Palazzo Pitti, offering the nuns in exchange for it not only a copy of the picture done by Francesco Petrucci, but also the embellishment, and practically the remodeling and restoration of all the decoration of their church by Foggini"

40296-102turne.jpg	The painting is also called The Bridgewater Sea-Piece.It was in marine painting, then regarded virtually as a branch of landscape, and in mountain subjects that Turner's personal vision was first clearly seen. In both the Old Masters played a part. His first exhibited oil had been a moonlit sea-piece, and it was as a companion to a picture by the Dutch painter Willem van de Velde (1611-93) that the future Duke of Bridgewater commissioned Dutch Boats in a Gale in 1801. Turner responded with a vivid account of churning seas and a sky divided between storm clouds and breaking sunshine, in which all is moving and changing. His vigorous painting of waves, viewed from within their troughs, showed his urgent sense of the medium.Turner's composition resembles that of his 17th-century predecessor, but Turner added an important dramatic element: the collision of the two ships in the foreground seems unavoidable

Four sources of light illuminate the greenish-blue landscape with its starry sky: the full moon on the right above the trees fringing a lake, its reflection in the water, the campfire of the cowherds on the left, from which a column of sparks rises into the darkness of the tree tops, and finally the torch in the hand of Joseph, who is leading the ass with Mary and the child. Each of these sources of light models the objects in the immediate surroundings only fragmentarily, so that illuminated areas are directly juxtaposed with unlit areas. Our gaze is drawn across expanses of impenetrable darkness, settling upon islands of fine draughtsmanship, and following the vaulted silhouettes of the tree tops.Here, night is portrayed as a miracle that can help the holy family on their flight to Egypt. Elsheimer has succeeded in evoking a sense of danger and comfort at the same time entirely by means of the atmospheric values of his use of light and shadow. It would therefore be wrong to place the emphasis entirely on the subject of landscape. This picture represents something entirely new in the field of religious imagery, with landscape opening up possibilities of exploring new narrative contents.Both Rubens (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kassel) and Rembrandt (National Gallery, Dublin) made paintings of The Flight into Egypt inspired by Elsheimer's masterpiece. Although Elsheimer died young and his output was small he played a key role in the development of 17th-century landscape painting, and his influence is apparent in the work of many other 17th-century artists

11002-311david.jpg	David, the political activist, was imprisoned in 1794. He survived the political change, and while still in prison planned a return to history painting and started work on The Intervention of Sabine Women, a project that was to occupy him until 1799. This subject, from ancient Rome, was the aftermath of the rape of the Sabines when, to ensure the population growth of their city, Romulus and his Romans abducted the womenfolk of their neighbours, the Sabines. Three years passed before the Sabine men, led by Tatius, mounted a counterattack. For the first time in a history painting by David, the central figure is a woman, Hersilia, who forces herself between Romulus, her husband, on the right, and the Sabine Tatius, her father, on the left. Other women cling to the warriors and place themselves and their children between the opposing groups.In this painting David contrasted the violence of the rape with the pacification of the intervention. The image of family conflict in the Sabines was a metaphor of the revolutionary process which had now culminated in peace and reconciliation. The painting was a tribute to Madame David, and a recognition of the power of women as peacemakers

18811-rosalima.jpg	This strange double work of the Guardi workshop was discovered in a private collection of Budapest. The same composition figures on both sides of the canvas, namely the Holy Virgin floating above clouds and handing a rosary to St Rosa, while from the left St Dominic, holding lilies in his hand, looks up to the Virgin. In style and in brushwork the two versions show a slight but unmistakable difference; comparison with works attributed respectively to Gianantonio and Francesco suggests that the picture shown here was painted by the elder brother, Gianantonio, while the composition on the reverse side is the work of the younger, Francesco.

32069-cremona8.jpg	The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history. In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency. From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed. By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.The decoration was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa�ade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa�ade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch. He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone. He painted the scenes above the next arch, and continued the cycle on the right wall, where he painted five scenes of the Passion above the three arches next to the apse.Romanino was commissioned for the next four scenes of the Passion on the right wall. In December 1519 he was commissioned to fresco the three remaining bays of the nave as well. However, the contract was revoked in 1520 and it was awarded to Pordenone. Above each arch there is just one broad field in which he painted Pilate Judges Christ; Carrying the Cross; Christ Nailed to the Cross. In each composition an immense, dense, violent jostling of figures is developed in a relief-like style and from a viewpoint slightly below the action.The narrative folds into the wall of the fa�ade, where the trilogy of the procession to Calvary comes to a close in the enormous fresco of the Golgotha by Pordenone

26765-0lastjud.jpg	"This fresco was commissioned by Pope Clement VII (1523-1534) shortly before his death. His successor, Paul III Farnese (1534-1549), forced Michelangelo to a rapid execution of this work, the largest single fresco of the century.The first impression we have when faced with the Last Judgment is that of a truly universal event, at the centre of which stands the powerful figure of Christ. His raised right hand compels the figures on the lefthand side, who are trying to ascend, to be plunged down towards Charon and Minos, the Judge of the Underworld; while his left hand is drawing up the chosen people on his right in an irresistible current of strength. Together with the planets and the sun, the saints surround the Judge, confined into vast spacial orbits around Him. For this work Michelangelo did not choose one set point from which it should be viewed. The proportions of the figures and the size of the groups are determined, as in the Middle Ages, by their single absolute importance and not by their relative significance. For this reason, each figure preserves its own individuality and both the single figures arid the groups need their own background.The figures who, in the depths of the scene, are rising from their graves could well be part of the prophet Ezechiel's vision. Naked skeletons are covered with new flesh, men dead for immemorable lengths of time help each other to rise from the earth. For the representation of the place of eternal damnation, Michelangelo was clearly inspired by the lines of the Divine Comedy:Charon the demon, with eyes of glowing coal/Beckoning them, collects them all,/Smites with his oar whoever lingers.According to Vasari, the artist gave Minos, the Judge of the Souls, the semblance of the Pope's Master of Ceremonies, Biagio da Cesena, who had often complained to the Pope about the nudity of the painted figures. We know that many other figures, as well, are portraits of Michelangelo's contemporaries. The artist's self-portrait appears twice: in the flayed skin which Saint Bartholomew is carrying in his left-hand, and in the figure in the lower left hand corner, who is looking encouragingly at those rising from their graves. The artist could not have left us clearer evidence of his feeling towards life and of his highest ideals.The painting is a turning point in the history of art. Vasari predicted the phenomenal impact of the work: ""This sublime painting"", he wrote, ""should serve as a model for our art. Divine Providence has bestowed it upon the world to show how much intelligence she can deal out to certain men on earth. The most expert draftsman trembles as he contemplates these bold outlines and marvellous foreshortenings. In the presence of this celestial work, the senses are paralysed, and one can only wonder at the works that came before and the works that shall come after"""

08514-2nudes1.jpg	Dr. Paul-Fernand Gachet was an admirer of C�zanne's paintings. He had come to live in Auvers-sur-Oise. He had met C�zanne through Pissarro, and persuaded him to come and live nearby in Auvers. C�zanne felt happy in the company of Gachet and his wife. One day, the discussion turned to Manet's painting Olympia, and C�zanne's version, A Modern Olympia, painted three years previously. C�zanne promptly took up his brush and painted a second version, unusually quickly by his standards. This relaxed painting, full of subtle irony, differs from the earlier version, which was stiffer and clumsier; it has a soft, delicate vividness which captures the sensuality of the scene

00885-50north.jpg	In 1447, or perhaps earlier, Fra Angelico was in Rome, where he painted the private chapel of Pope Nicholas V with scenes from the lives of St Lawrence and St Stephen, frescoes which sum up the whole trend of his work. They possess a logical realism in their perspective settings, clarity of scale and narrative content, and restraint in their vigour. The colour is limpid, but with sufficient use of chiaroscuro to give substance to the figures; the use of continuous  representation is kept to a minimum by the division of the scenes through differences in their architectural setting, but nowhere is the search for realism in the use of lighting effects allowed to destroy the unity of the whole, or the sense of the plane of the wall.The stories are told with a wealth of circumstantial  and colourful detail: for instance the allusion to the Pope's decision to declare 1450 a Jubilee Year is shown by the two soldiers about to break down  the walled-up door on the left but even a detail of this kind is never intrusive or merely included for decorative richness, but is at the heart of the narrative			
28614-3etreta3.jpg	�tretat, a Norman fishing village popular among artists of Courbet's generation and, later, the Impressionists. Its great cliffs, rising so precipitously from the beach and from the waters provided a striking contrast to sand-bound or storm-tossed boats below, and with the ever-changing sea and sky.One of the main features is a rock formation known as Porte d'Aval (or Aiouille), where a natural flying buttress appears to support an equally natural, crenellated tower. This sense of implicit architecture suggests a great city lost in primeval times. There are two other formations called Porte d'Amont, and the Manneporte.

08053-young_m.jpg	Rosalba Carriera painted - it would be no less true to say that she drew - with pastel crayons on softly tinted paper. Pastel colours are rubbed dry on to grainy paper in the form of a soft, powdery pigment with little in the way of binder, and they stick to the paper as a layer of coloured dust. As pastel colours can hardly be mixed by applying them on top of each other on the paper itself, the colour richness is created mainly through the juxtaposition of the powdered pigment. The palette of crayons has to be correspondingly elaborate. But the rubbed pastel never had a lasting quality. However, the 'jeunesse dor�e,' the aristocratic mistresses and the notorious courtesans all laid siege to Signora Carriera's studio, because the portraitist knew how occasionally to enrich the external charm of skin and costume with penetrating, characterful and emotional elements.The sitter of this portrait, painted by Carriera during his stay in Paris in 1720-21, is the daughter of the financier John Law (1672-1729)

10398-04adamev.jpg	This depiction by Lucas Cranach the Younger of the founders of the human race was part of a tradition in the Cranach workshop that spanned many decades. Lucas Cranach the Elder had produced a number of variants from 1509 onwards. Apart from small-sized versions on panel, we know of life-size pairs of paintings also by Lucas Cranach the Elder. Albrecht D�rer's first independent formulations of this theme in 1504 and 1507 were certainly the inspiration for Cranach's work on the subject. But unlike D�rer, Cranach was less interested in Antiquity and classical proportions, and operated rather within north Alpine traditions that were strongly influenced by Burgundian-Dutch forms.Cranach's fundamental principle of varying individual motifs is illustrated in his depictions of Adam and Eve. Not only the posture and the vocabulary of gestures, but also the positioning of the fig-leaves, the background design and the representations of the animals can be found in either similar or identical form in the various versions that came from the Cranach workshop. The method of combining individual components to produce a striking overall impression gives a special quality to the Cranachs' works, which are never mere copies of previous designs

40755-14icon.jpg	Unlike the Western depictions, which show St Christopher as a giant carrying the young Jesus across a river on his shoulders, most icons show him with an animal's head. Although his nickname kynokephalos means dog-headed, there are numerous variations ranging from a horse's or pig's head to one which, while human, is deformed. According to legend, the future saint came from a race of dog-headed cannibals and was originally called Reprobus (Lat: the cursed). His conversion to Christianity and his baptism brought him not only a new name, Christophoros (Greek: the Christ-bearer), but also a human figure and the ability to speak. From Samos in Lycia he travelled the country as a missionary, preaching the gospel. He succeeded in convincing many of the Christian message, as God reinforced his preaching with miracles, for example the flowering of his staff.On this icon, Christopher is shown in soldier's dress with a long spear in his right hand. In his left hand, he is holding a shield. Depicted frontally, the saint is flanked on the left by St Stephen, the first martyr, one of the seven deacons consecrated by Christ's apostles through the laying-on of hands. He is, as is usual, shown as a youthful deacon with the tonsure, and is holding a thurible in his right hand. The object in his left hand possibly represents the stones as attribute of his martyrdom

20869-stilhorn.jpg	Exceptionally for a still-life specialist, the Rotterdam-born Kalf was praised by an Amsterdam poet as one of the city's leading painters. Perhaps the praise would not have been forthcoming had he persevered in his first interest: shabby peasant barn interiors and still-lifes of humble kitchen implements, painted during his stay in Paris from about 1640 to 1646. After his arrival in Amsterdam, however, following his marriage to a cultivated young woman of good family, Kalf began to paint the type of still-life for which he is best known.Called in Dutch pronkstilleven ('still-lifes of display or ostentation'), these compositions, influenced by Flemish antecedents, feature luxury manufactured goods - silverware, Chinese porcelain, Oriental carpets, fragile glass - and exotic foodstuffs. They do not seem to have specific symbolic meaning but must have spoken to contemporary viewers of the wealth of the Dutch Republic, the might of its sea power and the efficiency of its distribution systems - for all this is implied in the eastern table carpet and in the fresh Italian lemon unwinding its peel in the foreground.The buffalo-horn in a silver mount belonged to the Saint Sebastian Archers' Guild, part of the city's civic guard. Dated 1565, this beautiful example of the silversmith's art, now in the Historisch Museum in Amsterdam, also testifies to the old Netherlandish tradition of municipal freedom, and the will of Dutch burghers to defend it. Kalf was to paint it more than once; it also appears in pictures by other artists.Ultimately, however, none of these associations is responsible for the grave monumental beauty of Kalf's painting. As in all his mature works, only a few objects are displayed and soberly arranged, in contrast with the luxuriant profusion of Flemish still-lifes. Against a dark background, succulent paint, broadly applied, models large forms and captures the very feel of surface textures. Strong accents of the richest and brightest colours surge to the surface - the huge scarlet lobster, the clear yellow and white lemon, touched with pink where it reflects the lobster. And it is the play of reflections and tinted shadows of these powerful hues which, like a musical motif, draws the composition together

44066-7lamenta.jpg	Apart from some outstanding portraits, only a few paintings from Rogier's late period are extant. They include a problematical Lamentation (The Hague) containing many figures, and the great Crucifixion (Escorial) which, unlike the Lamentation, is remarkably well documented. The Lamentation combines figures in Rogier's style with a composition lacking his ability to create a well-constructed unity.The gesture of St. Peter, seen right with his keys, obviously expresses a particular relationship with the donor, who was a bishop. The art historian Erwin Panofsky has suggested that the bishop is Pierre de Ranchicourt (d. 1499), the only bishop in the Netherlands in the second half of the 15th century whose first name was Peter. If the identification is correct, the painting could not have been commissioned before April 1463, when Ranchicourt became Bishop of Arras.The two halves of the scene are disconnected. Particularly unfortunate is the relationship between the woman crouching in the left foreground to the man next to her; it is almost as he had been pestering her and she were turning away in annoyance. This female figure also occurs in the fine Deposition (Louvre, Paris) of a later painter in Cologne known as the Master of the St. Bartholomew Altar: the figure corresponding to her there, however, has less in common with the woman in our picture than with her underdrawing. In the underdrawing (and like the woman in the picture by the Master of the Bartholomew Altar) she was holding a salt cellar - identifying her as the Magdalene - instead of a skull, and had her hand pressed to her breast.The figure was therefore imported into the Lamentation from an existing model, also used by the painter in Cologne, but was not harmoniously integrated in Rogier's usual way. Nor do the brown and orange tones in the robe of the saint wringing her hands behind the Magdalene resemble Rogier's typically cooler colouring.Perhaps the Lamentation was in fact done in Rogier's workshop, as the stylistic similarity of its underdrawing with that of the Florentine Entombment (Uffizi) would suggest, but it may be one of the many works by later successors of Rogier. It is worth noting that the saints to the left and to the right on the outside of the work show clear similarities to those on the wings of Hugo van der Goes's Portinari Altarpiece (Uffizi)

20436-justice.jpg	In his early work, Jacobello del Fiore was clearly working within the modes of Venetian painting of the late fourteenth century. But as soon as he came into contact with Gentile da Fabriano whom the Republic of Venice had summoned in 1414-1415 to decorate the Great Council Chamber of the Palace of the Doges with his International Gothic 'fables', he tended to shake free of all the abstract precepts of Byzantine art and develop a narrative fluency and a stylisation of shapes and forms which reflected the spirit of 'courtly' Gothic style. He adopted this style when dealing with official themes too, as in the 'Triptych of Justice' painted in 1421 for the offices of the Magistrato del Proprio at the Palace of the Doges

In spite of the dire financial situation of the Kingdom, she was the centre of a sumptuous court life, with exclusive luxury items and grand parties, which shed glory on the royal power.The present painting belongs to the group of around 100 pictures, studies, and sculptures that Zahrtmann created on the basis of Leonora Christine's (1621-1698) memoirs from 1869. Her life and destiny, spanning the range from wealth and power through imprisonment and shame to rehabilitation and release, fascinated Zahrtmann for almost 50 years. Sophie Amalie was behind Leonora Christine's arrest and 22 years of imprisonment in Blatarn. Zahrtmann hated her for that, and his sentiments are apparent with exceptional honesty in this depiction of her death throes.Surrounded by silverware and magnificent silks, the dowager queen Sophie Amalie breathes her last. A grotesque figure whose status and wealth cannot deliver her from a violent and painful death by asphyxiation

44740-bathsheb.jpg	Attributed to Giorgio Vasari, this panel was loaned to the Italian embassy in Berlin in 1908. Though the painting was assumed to have been destroyed in the bombardment of Berlin at the end of the Second World War, it survived and was acquired by the Wadsworth Atheneum (Hartford) in 1965. In 1998 the Atheneum returned the painting to the National Gallery at the Palazzo Barberini. The attribution to Zucchi was made in 1925, and the painting was dated to the first years of the 1570's on the basis of stylistic comparison to other Zucchi paintings of this period. The rich and lively chromatic range, the smooth surfaces, the movemented poses and the sculptural quality of the figures are all comparable to Zucchi's work at the Palazzo Vecchio and at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. On account of the closeness between the complex pose of the figure to the left and that of a small bronze allegorical figure of Astronomy executed by Giambologna (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum) in 1573, it is possible to set the 'terminus post quem' at that year.The toilet of Bathsheba was an Old Testament narrative that enjoyed great popularity during the Renaissance. From the roof of his palace, King David spied the lovely Bathsheba taking her bath. Though she was the wife of Uriah, one of his generals, David was charmed by the sight of her and ordered that she be brought to the palace to share his bed. When she became pregnant from their union, David arranged that Uriah should be killed in battle so that he might have Bathsheba for himself. His misdeeds were punished with the death of the baby, his first son. The second son of David and Bathsheba would be Solomon, who eventually succeeded him to the throne

24404-stgeorge.jpg	Martorell worked as a panel painter and illuminator in the service of the city of Barcelona, but he was often given the task of preparing designs for stained glass windows and for sculptures as well. This composition was originally the centre panel of an altarpiece; the two volets, with panels representing the saint's martyrdom, are preserved in the Louvre in Paris.In the arid, rocky surroundings of the foreground St George is on the point of killing the formidable dragon with a stab of his lance. Only the frightened eyes of the dragon and of the horse convey the dramatic qualities of the scene. Fright would be unworthy of the saint, his face is etherealized and serene. Bones of humans and animals are scattered on the ground. The princess is to be seen praying on the top of a rock. The wavy line of the dragon's tail is practically continued by the crevice in the rock. In the background, in the middle of civilized, idyllic scenery is the royal castle, surrounded by a moat, on whose emerald waters swans are swimming. The crowd gathered on the balconies and bastions of the building watch with excitement to see how the fight will end.If we turn the pages of the present volume to compare the illustrations we cannot see any other landscape which is so extensive - except, perhaps, in Gentile da Fabriano's picture. True, in this painting too the ground is rising steeply, as it usually is in works created in the International Style. However, it no longer stretches behind the scene like a decorative tapestry: its continuity is broken. A valley separates the background from the foreground; the castle appears to be placed lower than the place where the fight occurs. (All the same, the king and his household look downwards - to preserve his dignity and to render his superiority indisputable.) And whereas of the two spaces depicted in the painting the one further back has preserved the homogeneous and decorative features of landscapes in the International Style, the scene in the foreground is represented in a highly expressive manner, with many gradations of values. The light is reflected in different ways by the grains of sand, by the smooth rock, by the dragon's skin and its belly, by the metal armour and by the precious stones.The principal axis of the composition is determined by St George's long spear. In addition to this, a single imaginary vertical line connects the eyes of the dragon, of the horse and of the princess. In the form of a letter V the two straight lines flank the bastion of the royal castle

08959-roemer3.jpg	This painting depict a still-life of lemons and olives, pewter plates, a roemer and a fa�on-de-Venise wine glass on a ledge.Pieter Claesz. started painting still-lifes at the start of the 1620s. His early works are in the tradition of his Haarlem peers Floris van Dijck, Nicolaes Gillisz. and Floris van Schooten, with a colourful palette and a relatively high viewpoint, and comprising many objects and foodstuffs such as various kinds of fruit. By the middle of the decade, when his chosen viewpoint becomes lower, he was painting still-lifes of great beauty and of a remarkably high quality,The  present painting dates from the moment when Pieter Claesz. arrived at a fully monochromatic style. Claesz. achieves this by choosing objects of a limited palette to occupy his composition. The tones throughout are predominantly yellow and green. There are no other colours anywhere within the painting. The vast background is rendered in a muted yellow-green, moving from darker tones to the left to lighter ones towards the right, where there is stronger illumination.The painting is signed in monogram and dated lower right: PC Ao .1629

19979-5brando1.jpg	The pair of pendant portraits of the near-royal relatives and schoolfellows of Prince Edward (Henry Brandon and Charles Brandon) shows that the distilled power of quiet observation that is Holbein's main achievement in miniature `limning' could draw personality and character even out of the very young. Both boys appear as differentiated individuals; Henry impatient with the sitting, on the verge of becoming fractious, the more stolid Charles transfixed by his role as sitter.The refinement Holbein displays here was rarely bettered. The sad fate of the children casts a poignant aura across their portraits; the brothers died of the notorious `sweating sickness' within an hour of each other in 1551. Because the elder died first, Charles was deemed to have been (very briefly) the third Duke of Suffolk, heir to the bosom-friend of Henry VIII's youth, whose third wife had been Henry's sister, Mary, the dowager Queen of France

40137-drlesson.jpg	"To use the term coined in the eighteenth century, this is an excellent example of a domestic scene or ""conversation piece"". It contains the full range of types, and feelings, usually found in Traversi's work which uniquely captured Naples under Bourbon rule with a full range of ordinary people, aristocrats, and common folk. Traversi was always ready to turn his well-developed sense of humour laced with sarcastic bitterness on himself. Nevertheless the immediate, brilliant liveliness of the subjects should not make us forget the stylistic aspect of Traversi's work. He raised genre painting to a nearly monumental level, just as Giacomo Ceruti did in Lombardy.

17014-nuenen34.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 81, JH 695.In December 1884 van Gogh set himself the task of painting and drawing a large series of portraits of the peasants in Brabant. In this group of works he did not want to portray individuals but sought to characterize a type: the peasant. Rather than seeking beauty, he was looking for models that had rough, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips. He depicted the careworn peasants with mistrust in their eyes against a gloomy background, with dark colours and wide brushstrokes. By the coarse features, he wanted to express peasant life being at one with nature.The present painting stands out from the series because of its relatively bright colours

Putti blowing bubbles are often a symbol of the transience of human life, according to the motto 'homo bulla' (man is a bubble).

14672-madonna.jpg	This painting and the small Berlin triptych of 1353 are the only signed and dated works by Taddeo Gaddi that have survived, works that are therefore highly important for establishing a point of reference for this master's late style. The figures of St Mary Magdalen and St Catherine are seen standing on each side of the Virgin. The coat of arms of the Segni family appears on the base of the throne.Taddeo Gaddi worked with Giotto for twenty six years. He was responsible for popularising the master's style and laid the foundations on which the painting of the second half of the fourteenth century was built.Like other contemporary artists, Gaddi attempted to fuse the two great cultural sources represented by Giotto and Ambrogio Lorenzetti; the result is a nobly oratorical style, with little emphasis on the narrative dimension, and a dissolving of Giottesque drama into a dignified yet academic oratory. A serene monumentality pervades the entire composition.The work is highly important for our understanding of Taddeo Gaddi's late style for it seems to reflect a period of uncertainty, perhaps of crisis, towards Giottesque models

05248-04stjohn.jpg	In this picture Bosch shows St John the Baptist seated in a humid summer landscape. The composition may well have been influenced by a painting done some years earlier by Geertgen tot Sint Jans. Geertgen represented the thoughtful prophet staring abstractedly into space, rubbing one foot against the other, but Bosch shows him pointing purposefully towards the Lamb of God crouching at lower right. This gesture traditionally identifies John as the forerunner of Christ, the 'precursor Christi'. In this instance however, it also indicates a spiritual alternative to the life of the flesh symbolized in the great pulpy fruits hanging near him on gracefully curving stems, and in the equally ominous forms rising in the background

The picture shows St George Baptizes the King and His Family (top) and St George Liberated by Angels from Torture on the Wheel (bottom).According to the Golden Legend, the king had a large church erected in honour of the Virgin Mary and St George. The three-aisle basilica shown in cross section in the middle segment of the baptizing scene's expansive architectural backdrop, with its lofts, galleries, pulpits and all sorts of attached structures, is an allusion to this church.The St George cycle continues in the lower register of the wall with images depicting the saint being sentenced to various tortures. However, neither the cup of poison given to St George nor torture on the sword-studded wheel is capable of doing the condemned saint any harm. Two angels intervene and the wheel breaks into pieces, causing the commander, the torturers, and the onlookers to shrink back in horror

22205-golden.jpg	This well-preserved triptych was intended for domestic use for an unknown patron. The interlocking composition shows the people of Israel disobeying God's commandment by setting up a golden calf in the desert of Sinai and giving themselves over to dissipation. This took place after the long absence of their leader Moses, who was communing with God on Mount Sinai. When he returned after 40 days and 40 nights bearing the stone tables of the law on which God had written the Ten Commandments, he found the people dancing in a frenzy around the idolatrous image.Moses is depicted twice in the central panel. First he appears as a minuscule figure kneeling on a rocky overhang surrounded by black clouds, and then he is seen slightly lower down the mountain, this time accompanied by his servant, discovering the idolatry of the people and throwing down the stone tablets in fury. Below that in the middle, still in the background, is a small orchestra on the left, elated couples dancing around the calf, and on the right a group among the trees engaged in a round dance. The festive Israelites are scattered across the foreground of all three panels

16508-20stefan.jpg	This side of the triptych, with Peter, the prince of the Church, enthroned at its center, is constructed as if it were the cross-section of a church with a five-aisled nave: below the arcades of the side aisles the apostles James and Paul are standing on the left, with Andrew and John on the right			
16175-00view1.jpg	"This extensive depiction of the Last Judgment in the west of the church is dominated by the large Christ in Majesty at its centre. The twelve apostles sit to His left and to His right. Here the two levels divide: the heavenly host appears above, people plunge into the maw of hell below, or are led by angels towards heaven.The way this large fresco is divided into registers is traditional. But if we look at Giotto's invention in detail, then his novel attempts at visualizing different spheres, as well as abstract beliefs, become particularly apparent. In the center of the representation, Christ is enthroned as supreme Judge in a rainbow-colored mandorla. The deep, radiant gold background, the style of painting, and the delicate substance give the impression that the heavens have opened in order to reveal the powerful, extremely solidly modelled figure of Christ. Different levels are likewise alluded to when the choirs of angels disappear behind the real window, or when the celestial watch in the upper area of the picture rolls back the firmament, behind which the golden-red doors of the heavenly Jerusalem shine forth. The black and red maw of hell, which seems to anticipate Dante's ""Inferno"", is different again in its impact.The way in which Giotto establishes a connection between the present-day world of the faithful and the world beyond all time, the world of the Last Judgment, contains another interesting detail. The donor Scrovegni, still alive at the time, kneels next to those being resurrected and offers ""his"" church to the three Marys, assisted by a priest. The latter is portrayed in a most lively manner: his robes hang - painted quite illusionistically - over the arch of the portal"

10460-fairvill.jpg	Crespi rejected the opaque quality of Bolognese academic art to develop a realist vein that enlivened his work as a painter in Venice and Parma. His best pictures express an affectionate and sharp-eyed participation in the minor moments of the life of simple, unaffected people. Crespi was also a skillful caricaturist, as is shown by his expulsion from the Accademia Ghisilieri in Bologna for having represented Count Cesare Malvasia, a highly respected compiler of the city's art history, as a plucked capon. This Village Fair is similar to the one in the Uffizi. It has the same warmth of colour, acute description of the characters and sympathetic participation in the life of the market day.

26590-07_2ce7f.jpg	The third scene in the chronological order of the narrative, the Separation of the Earth from the Waters, is depicted in the centre of the vault of the seventh bay, between two pairs of ignudi with medallions.The last three scenes painted by Michelangelo in the centre of the vault evidently form a triptych representing the Creation. Proceeding toward the altar wall, the artist first frescoed the scene of the Separation of the Earth from the Waters; then - in one of the largest panels - the double scene generally known as the Creation of the Sun, Moon, and the Plants; and lastly, the Separation of Light from Darkness. Naturally, the chronological sequence start from the last of the above-mentioned scenes, which begins the account in Genesis. However, the events depicted immediately after this refer to the third and fourth days of the Creation, while the Separation of the Earth from the Waters took place at the beginning of the second day. The failure to respect the chronological order was probably dictated by the need to reserve the field of the largest panel for the scene that required most space for its representation.In the Separation of the Earth from the Waters the Lord flies over the gray-blue expanse of the waters, soaring aloft in his large billowing mantle together with his retinue of angels. His notably foreshortened figure seems to be launched from the left toward the viewer. Behind the Creator, the sky is clear and bright, while his other side it has turned grayish-white.The poses of the pairs of ignudi become gradually more dynamic and agitated. The two above the Persian Sibyl (at the left) bend backward in opposite directions, while one of those above the prophet Daniel (at right) bends forward, casting an apprehensive glance at the viewer, and the other raises his arm in a movement reminiscent of Hellenistic sculptures of dancing fauns.One of the medallions is not decorated, the other represents the Death of Absolom

30405-mad_sain.jpg	From the time of his very early works Parmigianino broke away from Correggio, his master, being attracted variously by Raphael, by the light effects of Beccafumi and by the bizarre touches of German engravings. In this work, however, executed after his stay in Rome, there is an unexpected return to the art of Correggio, discernible in the poetry which emerges from the warm, golden colour blends, almost creating a fantastic pictorial vision, and in the ability to capture spontaneous family affections. However, this pervading tenderness is crystallized immediately, intellectually, in the relationship between these human emotions, the refined images of the finely rendered background, and the serious, contemplative face of the saint in the foreground

42203-0102vela.jpg	"At an age when artists of today are only just beginning their studies at college, Vel�zquez was already painting his genre scenes: there are several studies of musicians and peasants eating. Later, around 1625, he began to paint scenes from the Gospels in which he found it possible to introduce everyday objects; for instance, in his picture of Christ in the house of Martha; he filled the foreground with a still-life of fish and eggs, relegating the figure of Christ to the background.In his Breakfast the human figures are scarcely more important than the still-life. It is of course true that the three figures reveal a thorough knowledge of anatomy, while the details are well chosen to indicate character and personal relationships. Superb craftsmanship is shown in the painting of the full, parted lips of the younger man, the eyes of the old man listening to the story and his slight movement towards the glass and the expression on the face of the woman pouring out the wine, concentrating lest a single drop be spilled. Nevertheless it is possible to argue that the most striking part of the composition is the still-life arranged on the white tablecloth. As a description of the bread, fish, lemon, carrot and copper jar seen here there could scarcely be a more inappropriate phrase than nature morte (dead nature), the term used for a still-life in so many languages. Still though these objects are, they have a genuine pictorial quality, a vigour which is akin to life itself.The Peasants at Table is one of Vel�zquez's finest early pieces of the type known in Spain as a ""bodeg�n"", a combination of conversation piece and still-life. There is another version of Peasant at Table in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg."

17195-cypres06.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 652, JH 1843.In addition to many canvases of the Proven�al olive groves, van Gogh painted 'portraits' of other kinds of trees typical of and epitomizing the South, cypresses and fir-trees. His treatment of these weather-beaten trees against a sunset sky confirms his revived interest in the artists and artistic tendencies with which he had been involved during his Dutch period, especially Barbizon landscape painting and the work of Jules Dupr� and Charles Daubigny. Both of these artists were well known to him from his years as an art dealer with Goupil and Company in The Hague, Paris and London. They had been the models to which he had turned when, in Drenthe, he attempted to make himself into a landscape painter. Indeed the painting is a decisive reminder of a particular work by Dupr�, Autumn (The Hague, Rijksmuseum Mesdag), which van Gogh had seen and noted at an exhibition in The Hague in 1882 and in imitation of which he had drawn a sketch of some old bog trunks at sunset in the autumn of 1883

15754-satan.jpg	The painting depicts God addressing a devil, who in turn points downward. The devil has the usual attributes of the fallen angel: dark colouring, bats' wings, pointed ears.The painting has a pendant: Job Sacrificing to God to Ask for Blessings on His Sons. The lunette shape of the two compositions, their dimensions, and the swift manner in which they were executed suggests two sketches for frescoes, perhaps part of a more extensive cycle. The two paintings were first attributed to Sebastiano Conca then to Corrado Giaquinto. However, neither attributions are convincing

13732-0view.jpg	Although work on the residential complex of the noble Selvatico family from Padua began in 1593, the construction of the villa was not completed until the 1640s. Lorenzo Bedogni, an architect and painter from Reggio Emilia worked on the construction, and he was also engaged as a painter of architectural motifs in the building. In 1649 he was joined in this decorative undertaking first by Pietro Liberi and then by Luca Ferrari, known as Luca da Reggio, who decorated the transept hall on the piano nobile. The selected theme was episodes from the life of Antenor, the mythological founder of the city of Padua.The scenes are displayed on the walls of the vast place in four large compartments. The dado below the compartments, painted in faux marmorino, circles the perimeter of the room. Interspersed with the painted scenes are depictions of the Virtues (Prudence, Nobility, Eloquence, and Kindness), set in illusionistic niches. Beneath each painting is a cartouche framing a description in Latin of the depicted event: The Flight of Antenor from Troy; Lycaon Consecrating the Dagger of Apollo; The Victory of Antenor over Valesius, King of the Illyrians; and finally The Founding of Padua.A fully Baroque aura pervades the cycle as a whole, in that the narrative thrust is made plain by the choice of clothing, contemporary with the artist's era - a device that transmutes the event into an up-to-date story

07763-30return.jpg	"Canvas No. 3 of the series of nine large paintings ""Stories from the Life of St Ursula"".The canvas showing the Return of the Ambassadors to the English Court also contains views of Venice and scenes from the everyday reality of the city in the late 15th century. See, for example, at the far left of the painting, next to the marble base that supports the pennant from which the standard is shown flapping in the sea breeze, the seated ""scalco"" or steward with his club and his gold chain, and the boy playing the rebec, both of them protagonists of the Venetian Republic's ceremonial protocol for receiving newly arrived foreign delegations.The view of the city is dominated by the splendid Renaissance palace, almost a symbol of Vittore Carpaccio's architectural painting. The description of the interiors is suggested by the volumetric structure of the building, whose wide arch depicted in deep shadow recalls the buildings painted about twenty years earlier by Antonello da Messina in his St Sebastian for the church of San Giuliano in Venice (the painting is now in the Gem&#228;ldegalerie in Dresden). The facades consist of luminous surfaces, enclosed by frames of projecting cornices and strips of coloured marble, decorated with marble basreliefs of classical subjects and with an extremely elegant row of windows opening onto a wide balcony.The diagonal perspective lines of this majestic construction, whose perfect architectural forms are reminiscent of the buildings that Codussi was designing at around that time, provide the basic structure on which all the elements of the composition are arranged: the bridge and the banks full of spectators, each carefully portrayed in costumes that denote social standing and origin; the pinkish brick paving, surrounded by the green grass of the ""campo""; the octagonal royal pavilion; the two mediaeval towers in the background, protecting the canal. The enchanted magic of the different planes, set out in the perfect construction of this ideal geometrical form, is paralleled in the rich density of the colours; in the pale lighting of this late spring morning the colours take on entirely new tonalities, especially in the shining silk costumes and in the imaginative headdresses. And, as always, Carpaccio grasps every last detail, like the swift trireme that has just docked at the pier next to a ""cocca,"" the typical Venetian freight vessel, or the casements of the balcony crowded with people, silvery cylinders of glass, some of which are broken"

12549-5young_w.jpg	"This small painting was in the collection of the Imhoff family of Nuremberg, and cited in their inventory from 1573-74 until 1628. In 1633, it was handed over, with the title Portrait of a Young Girl, with other works by D�rer, to Abraham Bloemart, an artist and merchant from Amsterdam. In 1899, the portrait reappears in London, and the firm P. and D. Colnaghi donated it to the Berlin art gallery.The delicate girl is portrayed with soft, curly blond hair, slightly dreamy her eyes, one somewhat lower than the other, a gentle, melancholic gaze; and well-defined, slightly parted lips. The red beret, worn sideways, with a little slit to the side, with a long red ruby and black pearl pendant, gives her a slightly cheeky air.The square green border of the red bodice sets off the upper part of her body. All these details put together have led to various interpretations. In addition to the fact that the ""girl,"" when sold by the Imhoffs, was transformed into a ""boy,"" Panofsky (1955) attributes an androgynous nature to her that could reveal the possible homosexual tendencies of the artist. A teasing letter of 1507 from the canonical Lorenz Behaim of Bamberg and the fact that the portrait does not seem to have been ordered would support this hypothesis. It has also been debated whether the painting was executed in Venice or after D�rer's return to Nuremberg. Considering the clothing to be typically German, there is no doubt as to its provenance"

18197-0203grec.jpg	The Baptism of Christ is the right panel on the front of the Modena Triptych.The Modena Triptych strikingly illustrates El Greco's transition from post-Byzantine icon painter to European artist of the Latin variety. The portable altarpiece, whose unknown patron perhaps stemmed from a Creto-Venetian family, in its open state shows a total of six scenes: on the front, the central panel bears a rare depiction of the Coronation of the Christian Knight, and on the wings we find the Adoration of the Shepherds on the left and the Baptism of Christ on the right. On the reverse, a View of Mount Sinai with its famous convent of St Catherine is flanked by an Annunciation  and an Admonition of Adam and Eve by God the Father.

40298-104turne.jpg	A consortium of Turner's patrons clubbed together to send him to Paris, during an interlude of peace in 1802, to study in the Louvre. He first embarked on a tour of the Alps, whose bleak splendour and subjection to constant climatic and geological change taught him the awesome scale and mutability of nature. The Alpine tour resulted in some spectacular watercolours but also, later, in paintings. He had not, in fact, witnessed an avalanche in 1802, but news of a devastating one in the Grisons in 1808 seems to have prompted him to his picture of 1810, in which huge rocks, driven before the weight of snow, crush a tiny chalet. Without a single human figure, it is a terrible revelation of human vulnerability and natural power - and of the potential of landscape as a 'Grand Style' in its own right
