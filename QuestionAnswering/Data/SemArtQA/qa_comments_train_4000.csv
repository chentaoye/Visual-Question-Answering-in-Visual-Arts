10699-portrait.jpg	The little archduchess (1816-1867), later queen of Naples and Sicily (1837&#151;1860), was portrayed when she was approximately three years old. Maria Theresia was the daughter of Archduke Karl (1771-1847), the victor of Aspern, and of Archduchess Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg (1797&#151;1829).The portrait is a slightly modified copy of a painting by Thomas Lawrence in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. In the copy, which he is thought to have executed in 1819, Daffinger adopted the English manner of painting, but deviated from the original in what the portrait expresses and in the execution of the park landscape in the background

04923-erdmann.jpg	The Jagdschloss Grunewald is a relatively modest hunting lodge in Berlin begun by the Kurfurst Joachim II of Brandenburg in the early sixteenth century. It is located in the woods, close to the city's suburbs. Many Dutch, Flemish, and German painting - mostly dating between the sixteenth and early eighteenth centuries - decorates the building. One of these paintings is the eccentric portrait of the little Erdmann August, Crown Prince of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, holding a tender spray of rosebuds.Heinrich Bollandt was a portrait and altar painter in Bayreuth, L�beck, and Berlin

42297-0801vela.jpg	"""Las Meninas"" is a Portuguese word used to name the Maids of Honour of the Royal children in the 17th century.Las Meninas or The Royal Family is one of the great problem pictures in the history of art. An almost infinite number of interpretations have now been proposed for the scene it shows. At first sight, however, Las Meninas seems to present no problems at all, and indeed appears perfectly straightforward in its sober geometry and good-humoured clarity.It is set in a room in the Alc�zar, equipped by Vel�zquez as a studio, and shows the heiress to the throne, the Infanta Margarita, with her court. Palomino names all those present. The queen's maid of honour, Dona Maria Agustina Sarmiento, one of the meninas, is kneeling at the Infanta's feet, handing her a jug of water. The other maid of honour, Dona Isabel de Velasco stands behind the princess, and beside her we see the grotesquely misshapen female dwarf Mari-B�rbola and the male dwarf Nicolasico Pertusato; the latter, as Palomino points out, is placing his foot on the mastiff lying in front of the group to demonstrate the lethargic animal's good temper. Further back, almost swallowed up in the shadows, are a man described only as guardadamas - a guard or escort to the ladies - and the lady in waiting Do&#241;a Marcela de Ulloa.Vel�zquez is standing with brush and palette in front of a tall canvas; we can see only the back of it. There are some large pictures hanging on the back wall of the room. Two of them were painted by Vel�zquez's son-in-law, Mazo, from models by Rubens, and show scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses, one of them another version of the punishment of Arachne. The princess's parents, the king and queen, appear in a dark frame below these pictures, probably the glass of a mirror. To the right of the mirror, on a flight of steps leading up to a doorway and a brightly lit adjoining room, stands Jose Nieto, the queen's palace marshal.There are several basic questions that have been asked again and again about this picture. What is Vel�zquez painting on the front of the canvas that is hidden from us? Where did he stand in order to paint the scene and himself in it? What is the source of the image in the mirror - that is, just where in the room must the royal couple have been standing for their reflection to appear? And finally, is there any significance in the fact that the red cross of the Order of Santiago is prominently applied to the artist's clothing?It was long thought that Vel�zquez was creating a picture without any metaphysical or speculative reference, and was merely recording a fleeting moment in permanent form, as if in a snapshot. According to this theory the subject was no more than an ordinary scene of palace life.A different hypothesis is put forward by art historians, who believe that intellect and keen perspicacity, as well as the artist's eye and hand, were involved in the painting of Las Meninas. The largest number of interpretations have been put forward for the mirror on the back wall, sometimes also thought to be a painted canvas. Much learned industry has also been applied to the question of location: in which room in the palace is this scene taking place? Despite the riddles hidden in the painting of Las Meninas we must not overlook its artistic mastery, particularly as expressed in the figure of the Infanta Margarita surrounded by people of lesser birth. For it was on the princess that the dynastic hopes of the Spanish Habsburgs rested after the death of Prince Baltasar Carlos"

16465-1crucifi.jpg	In contrast to earlier representations of Christ on the Cross, such as those by his teacher Cimabue, Giotto emphasizes the earthly heaviness of the body: the head sinks deeply forward and the almost plump body sags. The human side of the Son of God is made clear. Mary and John look down sorrowfully from the horizontal ends of the cross at the dead Lord.This, probably Giotto's earliest surviving work, is the largest and most ambitious of the shaped panels of Christ on the cross painted by Giotto. Although his limited anatomical knowledge prevented him attaining the realism of his later crucifixes (in Padua and Rimini), Giotto's break with Byzantine tradition is clear. This can be seen from the natural pose, the sense of real weight in the way Christ's body so painfully hangs, the basic simplicity of the loin-cloth, and the realism of the two feet fixed with a single nail

31067-2august4.jpg	In 1454 Piero agreed to paint a polyptych for the Augustinians of Borgo San Sepolcro; the painting was to be finished within eight years and was intended for their monastery. As usual, the work was not completed until much later. The polyptych later dismembered and the panels were scattered. It was only in the twentieth century that scholars succeeded in reconstructing this work. Among the parts of the polyptych that have unfortunately not survived there is also the central panel which represented the Virgin Enthroned.St Nicholas of Tolentino was one of the four side panels depicting four saints (St Augustine and St Michael at the left side and St John the Evangelist and St Nicholas of Tolentino at the right).St Nicholas of Tolentino is a more original figure than the others in the polyptych: the austere and calm features of his round face almost create a the effect of a portrait

23336-03young.jpg	"Curtains are an important iconographical feature in Lotto's work. The motif is adopted from devotional painting, where it often provided a majestically symbolic backdrop for saints or other biblical figures. Since early Christian times, the curtain had been seen as a ""velum"", whose function was either to veil whatever was behind it, or, by an act of ""revelatio"", or pulling aside of the curtain, to reveal it. To judge from the curtain which fills most of Lotto's canvas, we may safely conclude that he intends to reveal very little indeed of the ""true nature"" of his sitter. What he finally does reveal is done with such reserve and discretion as to be barely insinuated"

06249-holyfami.jpg	This work, Vasari informs us, was executed on the commission of Bartolomeo Panciatichi and this is confirmed by the family coat-of-arms which can be seen on a high tower forming part of the background landscape.The painting has a structure which is dynamic, abstract, yet at the same time frozen by sharp outlines, typical of Bronzino. Everything is harmoniously arranged in a great compositional balance, albeit of considerable complexity. In the foreground the group of the Virgin and St Joseph is built up with revolving movements, which are restrained below by the extremely smooth bodies of the two children. The delicate face of the Madonna, her almost chiseled hair, and the pose and form of her hands, closely resemble elements in Bronzino's famous portrait of Lucrezia Panciatichi.The grandiose and tormented plasticity of Michelangelo is here interpreted, by means of the smooth polish of the planes under a motionless, marble light, in pseudo-classic taste

32895-2bolsen.jpg	Another exceptional event, The Mass at Bolsena is represented after the Expulsion of Heliodorus in the Stanza di Eliodoro. It is the basis of the Catholic ceremony of the Corpus Domini.In 1263 a Bohemian priest, troubled by doubts about the doctrine of transubstantiation (the belief that the body and blood of Christ are present in the Eucharist), started out on a pilgrimage to Rome. On his way he celebrated mass at Bolsena, and during the consecration the Eucharist began, miraculously, to bleed. Each time he wiped the blood away with a cloth a cross of blood would reappear on the Host, a miracle that swept away the priest's doubts. The cloth became a venerated relic and was later kept at Orvieto Cathedral which was rebuilt (in its present form) to honour the occasion.Raphael represents the priest, the protagonist of the event, close to the centre of the composition. As he raises the Host, two devotees lean over the semicircular screen which forms the background of the scene. This is a further attempt by Raphael to represent figures in a more dynamic way. Some critics believe he was inspired by Lorenzo Lotto, who was among the artists who had begun to paint the Stanza della Segnatura before his intervention. Pope Julius appears at the right of the scene, a symbol of ecclesiastical authority's presence during, and approval of, the miracle. The Pope's attendants stand one step below and behind him.The asymmetry of the composition regards time as well as space: the excitement of the figures at the left represents a reaction to the supernatural event, which they witness; the stillness of the Pope and his attendants indicates their spiritual presence, achieved through a meditative evocation of the event

41908-stillife.jpg	This painting is one of a group of paintings that Van Utrecht produced in this form, beginning in the early 1640s, under the influence of small-format hunting pieces by Jan Fyt. A dead hare lies on a tabletop parallel to the painting's lower edge with its back legs trussed together, with a number of birds around an inverted wicker basket. An arrangement of vegetables, comprising a melon, cabbages and globe artichokes, balances them on the right-hand side. Suspended above the two groups is a ring hook, such is used for hanging game, to which five birds of differing sizes have been attached. A light source presumably located outside the painting to the left casts a strong narrow shaft of light onto the arrangement from the side. Some areas, such as the small birds skewered together on the rod at the front, remain in shadow. A softer light falls from the opposite side, a device that the painter used regularly to give body to the forms in his still-lifes.The individual motifs in the painting demonstrate a precise knowledge of the creatures depicted, which interestingly consist solely of small game. A wild duck, hanging by one leg in a dominant central position, is framed by two kingfishers, a sparrow and a blackbird, all attached to the ring. The hare lying head down on the tabletop echoes the bird's vertical lines in its outstretched body and continues them in its two front legs hanging down at the front. Two dead snipe have been placed decoratively, although in a strange position, beside the hare, while a partridge leans against a basket. A bullfinch, a goldfinch, and a variety of other finches have been skewered on a rod that projects from the table, a visual idea that is echoed by the artichokes on the other side.Adriaen van Utrecht drew inspiration in terms of both form and content from Frans Snyders, whose still-lifes with game and fowl1 contain a number of comparable motifs. But the precision in Van Utrecht's painting, his constant attention to detail, and his controlled use of colour, centring chiefly on a cool grey with shades of brown, green and violet, is stylistically much closer to Jan Fyt

15382-vanitas.jpg	This painting is regarded as the earliest known vanitas still-life painted in the Netherlands. The genre flourished from the 1620s onward.The dominant motifs in the picture are a human skull and, floating above it, a transparent sphere or bubble. These forms occupy a stone niche with a slightly pointed arch, the keystone of which is inscribed HVMANA VANA (Human Vanity). The spandrels flanking the arch are filled with sculptural figures of philosophers with books at their feet? to the left, Democritus, who gestures toward the globe and laughs; and, to the right, Heraclitus, who points to the sphere and weeps. The sphere purposefully resembles a soap bubble, the familiar vanitas motif. Two common vanitas symbols, cut flowers and smoke, rise from urns at either side of the niche. The coins depicted at the bottom of the composition on the sill between the vases were used as currency in the Netherlands about 1600. One of them, the silver medal of 1602 commemorates the capture of a Portuguese galleon by two Zeeland merchant ships earlier that year, off Saint Helena in the South Atlantic.Democritus (c. 460 - c. 370 B.C.) and Heraclitus (c. 540 - c. 475 B.C.) are known as the 'laughing and crying philosophers.'Democritus, a Greek philosopher, born at Abdera in Thrace, was known as the laughing philosopher because he found amusement in the folly of mankind. (The citizens of Abdera were proverbially stupid.) His philosophic system was contrasted with that of the earlier Heraclitus of Ephesus, who was known as the 'Dark' or 'Obscure' and was reputed to be melancholic. They were linked as a contrasting pair by Seneca, by Juvenal and others. Florentine humanists, to whom such classical texts were well-known used the pair to support the view that a cheerful demeanour was proper to a philosopher.The two philosophers are widely represented in European painting of the Renaissance and Baroque period, either in one picture or as companion pieces. A fifteenth-century example is Bramante's fresco, but the subject was especially common in Dutch art of the seventeenth century

One of them appears to see the celestial phenomenon - an angel bringing Joachim tidings of his impending fatherhood. Tremendous tension is created along the diagonal between the angel and Joachim, allowing us to comprehend what is happening.Giotto's tendency to depict human figures almost as geometrical shapes is demonstrated by the way the sleeping figure of Joachim seems contained as if within a cube. The stillness of the scene is broken by the liveliness of the sheep. Here Giotto was perhaps inspired by his legendary youth as a Tuscan shepherd boy

16732-oratory.jpg	Frescoes in the oratories of brotherhoods are found throughout Italy. In 1516 to 1518 the Sienese brotherhood of Mary and Bernardino commissioned Girolamo del Pacchia, Sodoma, and Domenico Beccafumi to fresco the walls of their oratory with a cycle on the life of Mary, The artists painted two stories each: Pacchia, the Birth of Mary and the Annunciation; Sodoma, the Presentation of the Virgin and the Coronation of Mary; and Beccafumi, the Betrothal of Mary and the Death of the Virgin. The missing scenes on the right-hand longitudinal wall, the Visitation and the Assumption of the Virgin were not painted by Sodoma until the late 1520s, and Baccafumi's altarpiece still later, between 1535 and 1537. The cycle begins on the left wall (The Birth of Mary to THe Betrothal of Mary), and continues above the altar wall (Annunciation) and the right longitudinal wall (Visitation to Assumption of the Virgin) through the second of the short walls (The Coronation of Mary). In addition to the stories from the life of Mary, there are four frescoed standing figures of Franciscan saints in the corners of the longitudinal walls

42235-0304vela.jpg	The long-awaited heir to the throne, Prince Baltasar Carlos, born on 17 October 1629, was his parents' (Philip IV and Queen Isabel) pride and joy. While Vel�zquez was in Rome he attended one of the glittering parties held in many European cities to celebrate the child's birth. No sooner was he back in Madrid than he was commissioned to paint the prince, now sixteen months old, and in another portrait of the same subject he shows the fair-haired little boy with a curious playmate. Dressed in a magnificently embroidered ceremonial robe which makes him into a miniature adult, the prince is standing on a carpeted step beneath a draped wine-red curtain, holding a baton and a dagger in his little hands. The steel gorget indicates his future role as a military commander. His face, expressing all the charm of his French mother in childish miniature, is turned towards another child in the left foreground of the picture, and the child's abnormally large head is looking back at him.This figure is a dwarf, it is now thought probably a girl, one of the human toys so popular at many European courts of the time. The physically handicapped figure of the dwarf holds a silver rattle and an apple in imitation of an orb and sceptre, and is acting the part of a comic major-domo to the future little king. One wonders whether their Majesties and the courtiers laughed at this picture and the court painter's amusing idea.The prince's face is modelled with gentle regularity, whereas the paint is applied to the head of the female dwarf with more irregular granulation. This contrasting brushwork is often used by Vel�zquez in his pictures to accentuate certain features of their content.In Spain (and other countries too) there was a long tradition of including dwarfs in royal portraits as subordinate figures. Basically, these deformed little creatures were merely attributes of the royal dignity, part of the furnishings of the court and regarded as neuter beings rather than fully human

32216-21plague.jpg	By 1630, Poussin was moving towards the uncompromising statements about the moral condition of humanity that were to characterize his work. In that year he painted the Plague of Ashdod (Louvre, Paris), which sets the style and mood of his work for the next five years. The figures are interlocked in an extremely complex composition which appears somewhat disorganized; in depicting the Old Testament theme, in which the spectator is spared none of the horror, Poussin was trying to achieve accuracy. The following year he painted the Empire of Flora (Dresden, Gem&#228;ldegalerie), a more cheerful subject but with a similarly interlocking frieze of figures. It is round these two pictures, datable through documents, that the rest of Poussin's pictures supposedly painted around 1630 have to be grouped

23315-19mysti.jpg	"The saints surrounding the Madonna are Jerome, George, Sebastian (at the left), Catherine, Anthony the Abbot, Nicholas of Bari (at the right).Lotto executed this painting in Bergamo for Marsilio Cassotti, signing it on the step of the throne in an inscription that reads ""Laur.tus Lotus 1524"". It was part of the collection housed at the Quirinal Palace, where it was noted by Cavalcaselle and Morelli, up until around 1912 when it passed to the Galleria Corsini. Within Lotto's career, this picture belongs to the last part of the period that he spent working in Bergamo. A direct comparison can be made with the almost contemporary Mystic Marriage of St Catherine at the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo, a picture signed and dated to 1523. In both works Lotto attains a compositional equilibrium through the interlinking of the figures. In the picture in Rome, the circular motion around the fulcrum of the Madonna is also underscored by seemingly improvisational light reflections which form a pattern of diffusion that centres on the figure of the Virgin.The medallion hanging from Saint Catherine's belt is typical of Lotto's world of emblematic symbols. Its winged putto is a recurring motif in the artist's work. Lotto employed a similar putto in his 1525 inlay designs for the steps of the choir entrance at Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo, accompanied by the motto ""Nosce te ipsum"". The motif and motto appear again in Lotto's portrait of an anonymous Thirty-seven year old man (Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome), though without the same degree of detail evident in the Mystic Marriage. The theme of wisdom and justice, symbolically communicated by the putto with his feet resting on a balance, is well adapted to this learned saint. Catherine is also portrayed with a richness of clothing and jewels which, though normal to her iconography, are distinctive in the refined attention with which the artist treats them. Lotto generally requested additional compensation for such intricate work"

35376-12religi.jpg	After becoming a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1598, Rubens left for Italy in 1600, where he spent eight years and visited all the major cities. He spoke Italian, knew Latin, and was familiar with the great writers of Antiquity. His period in Italy allowed him to study Antique works of art and the masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance at first hand. After returning to Antwerp in 1608, he was appointed court painter to Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella in 1609. He was given a great many commissions. Between 1613 and 1615, for instance, he painted the triptych The Incredulity of Saint Thomas for Nicolaas Rockox, which was destined for the chapel containing his tomb in the Franciscan church in Antwerp. Rockox, a famous Antwerp patrician and humanist, who was mayor of the city on a number of occasions, is shown in the left-hand panel, with his wife on the right

02523-8garden.jpg	"This painting belongs to a group called ""reversible heads"" which allow for a dual interpretation when turned upside-down, delighting the viewer with their metamorphosis. Viewed in one direction, the picture shows a traditional still-life: a metal bowl full mostly of vegetables. Turned upside-down, the forms alchemically come to life to produce a grinning face. The chubby cheeks and the long swollen nose obviously allude to the testicles and an erect penis. Similarly, the mushroom lips are reminiscent of the vaginal lips. By deliberately juxtaposing the male and female sex organs the artist clearly wished to refer to the sexual act. A possible interpretation is that the figure represented is Priapus, a fertility deity and protector of gardens"

03449-banquet.jpg	Dives and Lazarus is a parable in the New Testament (Luke 16:19-31) that teaches that riches on earth have to be paid for in eternity while the poor will enjoy their reward in heaven. There was a rich man (Latin: dives) who dressed in fine clothes and feasted every day while a poor man, Lazarus, lay at his gate starving. The dogs would come and lick the sores that covered the poor man's body. In time, both died and the poor man was carried to 'Abraham's bosom'; the rich man descended to Hades where, in spite of his pleas to Abraham, he was condemned to remain.In Bassano's depiction Dives sits at a table with a courtesan, attended by servants and entertained by musicians. A servant threatens Lazarus with a stick. Lazarus became popularly identified with the leper in the Middle Ages and, as though he were an historical figure, was in due course canonized and made the patron saint of lepers and beggars

34420-sacrific.jpg	"As the ""Sacrifice of Abraham, by the Pisan Orazio"", this painting is mentioned in a 1631 inventory of paintings found in the gallery of the Palazzo Mattei. The decoration of the palace at the commission of Annibale Mattei in 1624-26 was the last great Roman project to be given to painters who were all, to varying degree, connected to the Caravaggesque experience. The painting, attributable with certainty to Riminaldi and most likely datable to around 1625, is a precious document, considering the rarity of surviving works by this artist. As such, it is a firm point in the reconstruction of Riminaldi's stylistic development.After an initial attachment to Gentileschi and Manfredi, Riminaldi gravitated more towards artists in the French ambient, especially Vouet. He also exhibited a growing interest in the early Baroque experiments of Lanfranco. This painting reveals the artist's synthesis and passage between his own most influential sources; the art of Manfredi and that of Lanfranco. The total absence of violence or horror in this scene reflects Riminaldi's tendency to ""ennoble"" the Caravaggesque and Manfredian elements; currents typical to the naturalistic painting of Tuscany and clearly identifiable in Riminaldi's work.An autograph replica of this painting was recently on the Swiss antiquarian market."

25964-01virgin.jpg	Despite showing some signs of wear, this painting is something of a key work in our understanding of Memling's debut as a fully fledged master. Little studied until recently, it has long been viewed as one of Memling's earliest works, a youthful painting dating from before 1468 that might be a copy after Rogier van der Weyden. This is the most Rogierian Virgin ever done by Memling. The taut drawing and curved outlines within the compact triangle formed by the Virgin's head and hands and the Child do not appear in any other Memling work, except for copies after Van der Weyden, like the Brussels Virgin and Child. It is doubtful whether this too is a copy, however, as no other versions of the type exist. The overall composition is, in fact, a kind of adapted synthesis of the most famous Rogierian devices. The view between two columns, the crenellated wall and the perspective of the buildings on the left and right come from St Luke Painting the Virgin, the arch motif from the Miraflores altarpiece and the little dark blue angels from the Vienna Crucifixion. Memling's own vision is apparent even at this early stage in the calm, frontal position of the Virgin on her metal throne, accompanied symmetrically by musical angels. The golden sky is an interestingly archaic element that we rarely encounter even in Van der Weyden (Philadelphia Crucifixion, Frankfurt Medici Virgin). An oriental carpet is not used here either, and the Virgin sits instead on a simple, dark green floor-covering

18991-paper.jpg	In Scotland the 1880s saw a lively interest in open-air painting. The Glasgow School, numbering some thirty members, was of key importance. Foremost in the group were James Guthrie, his fellow Scot William MacTaggart and the Irish artist John Lavery. They agreed in their opposition to prevailing Victorian taste and the methods of the Royal Scottish Academy.Guthrie's work brought the Glasgow School international recognition. A brief visit to Paris in 1882 left him with the lasting impact of Barbizon plein-air painting, which he would adapt to his own landscape art in the years ahead. In the mid-1880s, Guthrie entered a critical phase which resulted in his almost entirely abandoning landscapes and turning to portraits, interiors and genre work. The Morning Paper is one of the finest of his many portraits of middle-class women. Guthrie's pastel technique here and elsewhere seemed to him (as it did to Degas) the aptest means of expression, since it was quick and easy to use and thus ideally suited to recording impressions on the spot

29748-d_family.jpg	Ochtervelt's paintings are almost all elegant upper-class interiors, in which he showed off a skill in painting silks and satins. The picture shown here is a typical example of his interior scenes.A middle-class family is shown stiffly posed for a group portrait in a rather bare but impressive hall.

The forms are clean-cut and as smooth and polished as if they had been turned on a lathe.Objects or certain motifs in seventeenth-century Dutch paintings were often endowed with a dual function.

It spreads warmth and beauty over the Dutch countryside, where sturdy animals - most often cows - take the place of human heroes. They stand or rest in complete harmony with nature, breathing the invigorating air of the never-distant sea. Herds of cows in Cuyp's paintings can be seen as allusions to the pride the Dutch took in their celebrated, profitable dairy industry. In literature and emblems of the time the cow was used as a symbol of various abstract ideas (fertility, loyalty, wealth, moderation, and as a symbol of the Netherlands)

20068-06concer.jpg	Besides religious and mythological scenes Honthors painted in the 1620s in Utrecht at least one illusionistic ceiling, the Musical Group on a Balcony, which was done for his own house in Utrecht. The painting is the earliest existing Dutch illusionistic painted ceiling.Equally innovative for Holland is his illusionistic Concert on a Balcony. The 'trompe-l'oeil' picture, which decorated the Palace of Nordeinde, shows, in steep perspective, life-size musicians and their companions in an architectural setting, but this one was intended as illusionistic wall not a ceiling. The prototype for Dutch illusionistic fields of walls and ceilings is found in decorative schemes executed for high-placed patrons in Italy. The unmistakable source for Honthorst's illusionistic paintings is Orazio Gentileschi and Agostino Tassi's life-size trompe-l'oeil frescoes, painted in 1611-12 for Cardinal Scipione Borghese's garden 'Casino of the Muses', now part of the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome. Honthorst had ample opportunity to study them when he worked for the Cardinal.

Scheffer's interest in the Faust story can be traced back to 1825, and between 1831 and 1858 he painted eight major compositions with themes from Faust, most of them episodes centring on Marguerite.The subject of Faust and Marguerite in the garden of her neighbour Martha who looks on with Mephistopheles comes from Part One of Goethe's Faust. The exquisitely painted Marguerite, beautiful and innocent, has a finely modeled torso, exuding a sinuous sensuality of which she appears unaware.

33619-07sp1630.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 12.Rembrandt began making paintings, drawings and etchings of himself in or about 1628, thereby inaugurating a career as a self-portraitist which is unique in the history of art. Those produced up to about 1631, when he moved to Amsterdam, form a distinct group from the rest. The majority - about fifteen - are etchings. Most are not finished self-portraits in the normal sense but studies in expression. Moreover, by comparison with the self-portraits of other artists and with some of Rembrandt's own later ones, they are unusually direct in approach, sketch-like in handling and small in size. In part, Rembrandt was using them for practice, to discover for himself the range of expressions of which the human face is capable; he needed this information for the portrayal of emotion in his subject pictures. In part, however, he was making use of a picture-type - the head-and-shoulders figure marked by a strong facial expression (the seventeenth-century Dutch term is tronie} - for which there was a lively market in The Netherlands in the 1620s. With most artists these pictures were of genre subjects: small boys, tramps, drinkers, musicians and so on. Where Rembrandt was original was in using his own features for the purpose.Gradually, however, he discovered that more normal portraits of himself were marketable. The Liverpool Self-Portrait reproduced here dates from towards the end of his Leiden period and is transitional between a study of expression, a tronie, and a conventional head-and-shoulders 'portrait of the artist'

11213-1890s_08.jpg	After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing. French artists devoted a significant part of their work to the praise of woman's beauty, albeit less in the nineteenth than in the eighteenth century. Unlike to his predecessors, Degas describes intimate scenes without intimacy, bodies without sensuality. The women bathing, washing, drying themselves, combing their hair or having it combed, are mainly seen from behind. They do not seem to heed the intimacy of the boudoir or bathroom scene.

21850-calasanc.jpg	According to the tradition this picture was ordered in Vienna by Schuperger K�roly of Tata, for Tata's Piarists in 1767. Leicher, who worked in Vienna, was a pupil and proteg� of the Piarists. He worked a lot for them, and made several altarpieces with the representation of St. Joseph of Calasance (1556-1648), the founder of the order. who was canonized in 1767. These pictures mainly refer to the educational activity of the order, and show the saint in a circle of pupils, as he recommends them to the patronage of Mary and the little Jesus who are appearing among the clouds. The theme is the same with this devout Tata painting: the boys, who wear the fashionable clothes of the time, are accompanied by St. Joseph and their guarding angel. The lighting of the picture which draws the spectator's look upwards, the  expressive gestures, and the sweet, mild faces call to mind the art of Leicher's master, Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The Tata picture is one of the most harmonious works of Leicher in Hungary. He repeated this theme, with larger dimension and a changed composition, in Brezn�'s Piarist church (today Parish church) as well as in the altarpieces of the Nikolsburg (Mikoluv), Beneschau (Bensov u Prahy) and Nagyk�roly (Carei) Piarist churches. A painting of his with the same theme in the Viennese house of the Piarists has been engraved by J. A. Jidl in 1757

05098-holyfami.jpg	Once in the Roman convent of San Silvestro in Capite, this picture remained in place there until 1922, when the convent building (already suppressed in 1871 ) was transformed into the Ministry of Public Works. The painting is not recorded in old sources or guidebooks, perhaps because it was kept on the cloistered side of the complex and was inaccessible to the public.The placement of the picture in the chronology of the painter's career is somewhat controversial. Many experts accept 1609, on the basis of documents relating to the decoration of the convent, and of substantial stylistic and typological comparisons between this picture and the artist's 1608 Sezze altarpiece.The overall composition of the canvas depends on Raphaelesque prototypes such as the Holy Family with Saint Elizabeth (Paris, Louvre Museum). The famous basket at the lower right, meanwhile, has a precedent in Giulio Romano's Madonna of the Cat, now in Naples (Museum of Capodimonte). Nevertheless, the close point of view, the strong and distinct light source, and the thickening of the shadows all leave no doubt about Borgianni's tight adhesion to naturalistic modes. Above all, Borgianni's naturalism shines forth in the extraordinary optical rendering of the basket of linens at the lower right

31207-03sigism.jpg	Piero was favoured by some of the smaller city-states like Urbino and Rimini in central Italy. For Sigismondo Malatesta, the lord of Rimini, he painted this devotional subject in the family's church known as the Tempio Malatestiano. This building was completely remodeled by one of the great architects and theoreticians of the Renaissance, Leon Battista Alberti, who almost certainly had contact with Piero during the years their careers overlapped in Rimini, Urbino, and Rome. This fresco has suffered severely over time and can only be read in its basic outline. The young prince is kneeling in profile before his patron saint, the old bearded Sigismund, whose placement is not strictly frontal, as might be expected. St Sigismund bears a resemblance to the recently deceased Holy Roman Emperor by that name, which may add another layer of meaning to this work

29667-apostle.jpg	Nogari lived his whole life in Venice and in 1756 became a member of the Accademia di Pittura e Scultura. From the 1730s he became widely known among collectors north of the Alps for his allegorical and religious portraits done as half-length and head studies. He also painted a number of altarpieces in his native city.The present work shows Peter as the bringer of God's word. His right hand points to the Bible, while his gaze is directed in the diametrically opposite direction to the light entering from the upper left, which embodies the source of divine inspiration. The apostle holds a key of bronze and one of gold, thus underlining his authority as the 'rock' upon which Christ will build his church (Matthew XVI, 18).Peter died a martyr's death at a great age. Nogari emphasises the apostle's age in his picture, skilfully revealing his elderly body. Peter's right shoulder, his face, worked in thick paint, and his wispy grey hair are placed most fully in the light and stand out boldly from the dark, diffuse background

13699-crucifix.jpg	This is the central scene from the large dividing wall of the convent church, located at the start of the road leading to the Sacro Monte at Varallo.The overall structure of the monumental composition (which comprises a sequence of pictures showing episodes from the life and passion of Christ) is very much in the Lombard-Piedmontese tradition of frescoed dividing walls. Nevertheless, in every scene Gaudenzio tried out emotionally charged compositional ideas or new methods of painting perspective and light. It was here that he did the groundwork for the Sacro Monte chapels where The Scenes from the Passion of Christ achieved both overwhelming popular appeal and artistic nobility.The Crucifixion is an excellent example of how Gaudenzio was able to mix traditional features (the helmets, coats of armor, and bridles which are shown in relief) with novel figurative allusions from Perugino to Leonardo. The whole thing is underpinned by Gaudenzio's narrative and dramatic power which pulls all the characters into a single, engulfing wave of feeling. Following the church's advice in the Devotio Moderna, Gaudenzio sets all the gospel episodes in his own day. At the foot of the Cross, to the right, we can see two people from Varallo accompanied by a boisterous dog and sweet women with babies in their arms. These sunny, everyday images contrast sharply with the ugly, caricatured faces of the soldiers who are playing dice for Christ's clothes.

18232-0502grec.jpg	In August 1577 El Greco was formally engaged by Diego de Castilla (1510/15-1584), dean of Toledo Cathedral, to paint three altarpieces for the Cistercian convent of Santo Domingo el Antiguo. The two side altars were to be decorated with The Adoration of the Shepherds (now in private collection) and The Resurrection (still in situ), while the main altar received an enormous, multi-tiered altarpiece with six canvases that had as its focus The Assumption of the Virgin (signed and dated 1577, now in the Art Institute, Chicago) and The Trinity (Prado, Madrid). The complex was among the most ambitious of El Greco's career and constituted one of his finest achievements. The missing canvases - The Assumption of the Virgin, The Trinity, and the half-length figures of Saint Benedict (Prado, Madrid) and Saint Bernard (private collection) - have been replaced by copies, so that the character of the altarpiece can still be appreciated.El Greco's talents doubtless came to the attention of Don Diego through his illegitimate son Luis, whom the artist would have known in Rome in about 1571-75. It is possible that El Greco was approached for the commission in Rome and that his move to Spain was prompted by the prospect of this magnificent opportunity. Certainly, this commission initiated El Greco's career in Toledo in the most auspicious manner conceivable.El Greco was supplied with plans of the church as well as designs for the frames of the lateral altarpieces drawn up by Juan de Herrera, Philip II's architect at the Escorial. El Greco had furnished drawings for the project and he promised to paint the specified scenes to the complete satisfaction of Don Diego and to remain in Toledo until the work was finished. Additionally, he was to superintend the design of the frames as well as of a tabernacle and five statues to adorn the main altarpiece - two of Prophets and three of Virtues (Faith, Charity and Hope). Like the frames, these statues were carved - with significant modifications - by Juan Bautista Monegro (c. 1545-1621), who was also responsible for the cherubs holding an escutcheon with the sudarium.This involvement with the frames of his altarpieces as well as with their sculptural adornment was to become typical of El Greco, who owned the architectural treatises of Vitruvius and Serlio and in Venice had learned to model figures in clay and wax to study elaborate poses. It was by means of his carefully articulated, almost rigorously classical frames that El Greco created a neutral foil for the agitated, spiritual world his paintings conjure up. In the great Assumption of the Virgin, the Apostle closest to the picture frame turns his back to the viewer, thus closing off the steep, notional space of the painting: the viewer is a distanced spectator. By contrast, in the smaller, lateral altarpiece of The Adoration of the Shepherds, a half-length figure of Saint Jerome seems to pose a book on the edge of the frame and turns to address the viewer, serving as a link between two worlds: he is painted in a distinctly more realistic style than the figures of The Adoration, positioned deeper in space, and he thus serves as a mediator between the real and the fictive

31808-2explosi.jpg	"After his earlier, peaceful farmyards, landscapes, and moonlit beaches, Van der Poel seems to have developed a penchant for the depiction of catastrophic events. Not only did he paint numerous views of Delft during and after the explosion of 1654 that devastated large parts of the city but, possibly inspired by the event, he also made a specialty of nocturnes showing burning houses and people desperately trying to fight the fire and save their possessions - or loot other people's. These ""brandjes"" (little fires), as they were known in contemporary inventories, were evidently popular and gained Van der Poel the accolade of being 'the best painter of fire in all of the Netherlands."

07531-29ceras.jpg	In 1600, soon after he had completed the first two canvases for the Contarelli Chapel, Caravaggio signed a contract to paint two pictures for the Cerasi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo. The church has a special interest because of the works it contains by four of the finest artists ever to work in Rome: Raphael, Carracci, Caravaggio and Bernini. It is probable that by the time Caravaggio began to paint for one of its chapels, The Assumption by Annibale Carracci was in place above the altar. Caravaggio's depictions of key events in the lives of the founders of the Roman See have little in common with the brilliant colours and stylized attitudes of Annibale, and Caravaggio seems by far the more modern artist.Of the two pictures in the chapel the more remarkable is the representation of the moment of St Paul's conversion. According to the Acts of the Apostles, on the way to Damascus Saul the Pharisee (soon to be Paul the Apostle) fell to the ground when he heard the voice of Christ saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?' and temporarily lost his sight. It was reasonable to assume that Saul had fallen from a horse.Caravaggio is close to the Bible. The horse is there and, to hold him, a groom, but the drama is internalized within the mind of Saul. He lies on the ground stunned, his eyes closed as if dazzled by the brightness of God's light that streams down the white part of the skewbald horse, but that the light is heavenly is clear only to the believer, for Saul has no halo. In the spirit of Luke, who was at the time considered the author of Acts, Caravaggio makes religious experience look natural.Technically the picture has defects. The horse, based on D�rer, looks hemmed in, there is too much happening at the composition's base, too many feet cramped together, let alone Saul's splayed hands and discarded sword. Bellori's view that the scene is 'entirely without action' misses the point. Like a composer who values silence, Caravaggio respects stillness.Both this and the following painting appear to be second versions, for Baglione states that Caravaggio first executed the two pictures 'in another manner, but as they did not please the patron, Cardinal Sannesio took them for himself'. Of these earlier versions, only The Conversion of St Paul survives

It obeyed natural law, and could be stunted only by outside intervention. In this painting plants themselves create a portrait of the painter. On a windowsill overlooking Copenhagen harbour stands an array of pots whose contents represent both his life and his art - an unsprouted seed, a protected cutting, a young agave, a flourishing hydrangea and a withered amaranth - together with casts of a child's and an adult's foot, and a sketchbook whose pages are waiting to be filled. A captive bird hangs in its cage above, doubtless yearning for its freedom. A mirror in the window is placed too high to reflect the artist, but his presence is everywhere in the work's symbolic programme

30049-saints.jpg	According to several scholars, Friedrich Pacher was the famous Michael Pacher's relative and collaborator. His style developed under the influence of Michael.This panel is one half of a predella which consisted of two parts for the representation of the most highly revered saints of the Franciscan order. The other side also depicts Franciscan saints. This panel adorned the lower, not very clearly visible, subordinate addition to a major altarpiece, hence the modest colour scheme content to forgo variety. Gaunt faces with strong cheek-bones, receding chins and thin lips are frequent in the master's oeuvre. The minutely elaborate broken folds, particularly at the elbows of sleeves, reveal the important part of sculpture in the activities of Michael Pacher, the most outstanding member of the studio, and also the deep absorption of sculptural forms in his style of far-reaching influence. The text giving the names of the donors and the date in fine Gothic minuscules occupies an outstanding place in the lower image field

08009-trinity.jpg	"The painting can be called ""Guercinesque"", it anticipates the style of Guercino. Lodovico managed to express the transcendent in terms of great intimacy and sincere humanity, qualities that were to be indispensable in the formation of the young Guercino.The subject, very unusual at the time of the Counter-Reformation, goes back to a purely medieval iconographic idea. Instead of the traditional, hierarchical representation of the Trinity with God the Father between the Holy Spirit and Christ on the Cross, Lodovico combines this theme with a scene of the Pieta, in which Christ is received into the Father's arms rather than those of the Virgin and is surrounded by angels who bear the symbols of the Passion.The painting formerly was attributed to Annibale Carraci but this attribution was correctly changed in 1956 in favour of Lodovico"

39731-6tarquin.jpg	"The story of the rape of Lucretia was one of the best-known episodes in the early history of Rome. It told how Sextus Tarquinius, brutal son of the tyrannical king, forced the virtuous wife Lucretia to accede to his lust by threatening that he would kill both her and her servant-boy if she refused, and afterwards claim that he had discovered them together in the act of adultery. To prevent this dishonour to her husband and family, Lucretia permitted herself to be raped, and was thereby able to tell her story and demand vengeance before she committed suicide.According to Titian himself, he invested ""more pains and skill"" in the ""invention"" of this picture, painted for King Philip II, than in many of his other late works. It does contain certain weaknesses of anatomical structure, but its technical versatility and brilliant colouring show that the old master was still in command of considerable abilities. However, the ""invention"" was not Titian's own, but drawn from a fresco by Giulio Romano. Whether the old Titian had ever seen Giulio's Mantuan fresco is not certain; he may have used as his model a reproduction engraving by Giorgio Ghisi, showing the composition of the picture reversed.As a kind of secular saint, Lucretia was represented quite frequently in Renaissance art"

10465-nymphs.jpg	The subject of Diana's nymphs disarming the sleeping cupids was undoubtedly inspired by a composition by Francesco Albani, Crespi's predecessor in Bologna. Known through two versions, one in the Mus�e du Louvre, Paris and the other in the Galleria Borghese, Rome, the subject seems to have been invented by Albani, who definitely included each of these versions in a series of four paintings of the story of Diana and Venus. Crespi also painted several versions of the subject.Diana has sent her nymphs to harass the cupids as a means of seeking revenge against Venus. The nymphs are cutting off the cupids&#146; wings, stealing their bows and quivers and throwing their arrows into the fire.

38435-03szinye.jpg	"Time after time, Szinyei returned to the theme of a party relaxing in the outdoors, proceeding systematically from the sketches made for his first plein-air painting in 1867 to the final version of ""Picnic in May"", ""Lovers"" also forms  part of this process: a colourful group, in this case two people, is shown on a hillside. Instead of the previously preferred gardens at springtime, now the early summer meadows are chosen as scenery. In the evenly dispersed light the pale local colours are harmoniously adjusted to one another. This gentle colouration establishes the lyric, effect of the picture. The interlocking eyes, the masterly execution of the hands, the softly curling outlines within the closed composition and the dreamlike background all contribute to the intimate atmosphere of the painting. The fine Naturalism of the picture reminds the viewer of Bastien-Lepage's Haymaking (1877, Paris, Mus�e d'Orsay). This is interesting from the point of view that around 1890 the Nagyb�nya painters, who could be regarded as Szinyei's followers, were all enthusiastic about this particular French painter, yet at the time they still could not have seen the early works of Szinyei, which were held in America. This meant that the contimuity of Hungarian painting suffered a setback."

20122-50hooch.jpg	In the interior of a grand house, a group of figures are gathered around a table playing a game of cards. The officer in the right foreground shows his hand of cards looking directly out of the picture as he does so, seemingly acknowledging the presence of the viewer and inviting us to watch the course of the game. The seated female figure is carefully considering the next card she will play while the sumptuously attired woman on the left has sprung from her chair, caught up in the excitement of it all. A canal-side scene, bathed in warm summer sunlight can be glimpsed through the doorway to the right and provides a contrast to the more animated proceedings at the table.This genre scene was painted in the artist's Amsterdam period but it has its origin in the interiors that De Hooch began to paint in Delft in the mid-1650s

29285-217muril.jpg	This mature work is one of the rare paintings of Old Testament subject by Murillo. There is an earlier treatment of the subject by Murillo, now in Kassel. Although the overall setting recalls Murillo's earlier treatment, the mature work is rendered with the soft handling, fluent brushwork and light palette which characterises the artist&#146;s work from the 1650s onwards. It is notable that this is one of very few depictions of nudes within Spanish painting of the 17th century, for at the time the doctrine of the Counter-Reformation was uncompromisingly enforced by the representatives of the Spanish Inquisition.

30408-pallas_a.jpg	Parmigianino's most important work survives in Emilia, principally in the Rocca at Fontenellato and in the church of Santa Maria della Steccata in Parma. He also worked in Rome (1524&#151;27), where he painted The Vision of Saint Jerome (London, National Gallery), and at the end of his life in Casalmaggiore, where he was exiled for failing to complete the decorations in Santa Maria della Stec- cata begun in 1534. Pallas Athene would appear to be a late work and is comparable in style with Parmigianino's last altarpiece, The Virgin and Child with Saint Stephen and Saint John the Baptist (Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen), painted for the church of San Stefano in Casalmaggiore in 1539-40. The gracefulness of the style evolved for the so-called 'Madonna with the Long Neck' of around 1535 (Florence, Uffizi) gives way to a greater sense of gravity in these late works, characterised by slower, more ponderous rhythms and simpler compositions. The warm flesh tones and the drapery that resembles thin sheets of beaten metal are also hallmarks of the artiste late style, although the elegant turn of the head, the etiolated fingers and the delicate treatment of the highlighted strands of hair evoke the earlier, more poetic style.The appearance of Pallas Athene complies with Ovid's description in his Metamorphoses VI. The figure wears armour but lacks the helmet and spear, perhaps because the artist chose to emphasise the association with wisdom and the arts as opposed to more warlike aspects. The plaque indicated by the hand is reminiscent of an antique cameo, but it is not a copy. The depiction of the city and the winged figure of Victory flying with a palm and an olive branch are references to Pallas Athene's success over Poseidon concerning the ownership of Attica, of which Athens was the capital

38429-5dancer.jpg	"Bertalan Sz�kely, who produced great paintings in various different genres, first turned to the problem of capturing the gracious movements of female dancers in the 1860s, at the time of painting Ladislas V and Ulrik Cillei. Later the same theme reappeared in his series The Life of the Woman and The Life of the Lascivious Woman. He painted his ""The Dancer"" around 1875. Here he seems to have been much preoccupied with lighting and the impressionistic delineation of the tired dancer at rest. Despite the warm yellow-red tones, a quiet resignation dominates the painting - this mood is probably in reference to the letter the fragile female beauty is holding in her hand"

37100-0view.jpg	The Santuario della Santa Casa (Sanctuary of the Holy House) at Loreto was constructed in the fifteenth century to enshrine the Holy House (Santa Casa) of the Virgin Mary, which tradition held had been brought from the Holy Land to Loreto by angels in the fourteenth century. The heart of the sanctuary is an unprepossessing brick chapel, said to be the structure in which the Virgin Mary was born, received the Annunciation, lived with Joseph and her child after returning from Egypt, and finally died in the presence of the twelve apostles.In its layout, the shrine consists of three-aisle arms ending in apses to the north, east, and south, and a six-bay nave extending to the west. The chapels off the nave were added only after 1507, by Bramante. Around the crossing, with the Santa Casa in the centre, are four octagonal rooms, closed off by doors, that are referred to simply as sacristies. Two of the four were painted in the fifteenth century, the Sacristy of St John by Luca Signorelli, and the Sacristy of St Mark by Melozzo da Forli.There is a close connection between the gospel texts and the pictorial programs of the two painted sacristies. The paintings in the Sacristy of St Mark focus on the Passion, appropriately, since it is Mark who describes it in the greatest detail. The Gospel of St John, by contrast, places particular emphasis on the gathering of Christ's disciples and the mission of the apostles, and this is reflected in the paintings of the Sacristy of St John.In five of the seven openings on the walls of the Sacristy of St John - the eighth is taken up by the window - there are pairs of apostles in dispute. The Conversion of Paul, a scene filled with dramatic movements, fills the one above the door, and the viewer sees it only when he turns to leave. The last opening, centred on the right as one enters, presents another familiar event, but one that in its composition repeats the pairings of the apostles, for it presents two figures side by side. In this case it is Christ and the apostle Thomas, who places his hand against the wound in Christ's side to assure himself that this is the resurrected Christ.The individual apostles cannot be identified with the exception of Peter and John, who stand in the panel to the left of the Christ-Thomas grouping. The idea of presenting pairs of apostles in debate is borrowed from the bronze doors that Donatello created for the Old Sacristy at San Lorenzo, Florence. Signorelli borrowed not only some of the compositional features of Donatello's reliefs but also specific iconographic details. Like Donatello, he depicts his apostles barefoot and draped in classical garments, eschewing any identifying attributes and even halos

17995-10young.jpg	"The sequence of pictures begins with the youngest king. On the horizon his retinue is moving down from the mountains. At the highest point is a small medieval fortress, possibly Jerusalem, where the Three Kings first went. However, the architecture of the complex is reminiscent of the Medici villa in Cafaggiolo, which Cosimo de' Medici commissioned Michelozzo to build in 1451 in the style of a medieval castle.The young king, who is looking towards the old king on the opposite wall, was thought to be a portrait of Lorenzo de' Medici. However, it is not probable since at the time the work was created, he was just ten years old. Rather, in these features Gozzoli is repeating a portrait formula which he also uses in other places, especially the angels' heads. Furthermore it would be unusual to portray a member of the Medici family in so prominent a position. Benozzo was aware that such portraits belonged at the edge, not in the centre of the composition. The portraits of the Medicis can, therefore, be found at the front of the young king's retinue. At the head of the group, behind king, rides Piero de' Medici (1416-1469), who commissioned the frescoes.Benozzo has also immortalized himself in the densely crowded retinue in close proximity to the ""familiari"". We know this from the inscription of his name on the red cap. In recent research the two youths in front of Benozzo have been identified as Lorenzo and Giuliano Medici. By having themselves depicted in the procession of the Three Kings, the Medicis were demonstrating both their political and their financial power. They had themselves depicted at the end of the procession, as part of the youngest king's retinue, and not as part of the retinue of the oldest king, who is nearest their goal"

26129-36ursu.jpg	"The St Ursula Shrine was the first Memling work to be identified as such in a historical text. Although commissioned for St John's Hospital, it has neither an inscription nor a signature, unlike the St John altarpiece and the Floreins triptych, both of which were ordered for the same institution. This might be explained by the fact that the shrine was not on permanent display, but was shown only on the feast-day of St Ursula. Unlike the paintings, which also focus attention on the donors and the maker, this is a purely liturgical object.Memling's care for detail and constant concern for harmony are part of his predilection for a classical style. These aspects of his art are given their finest expression in the St Ursula Shrine. Memling was commissioned to decorate a new reliquary, to which the saint's remains were to be transferred on 21 October 1489 during a grand ceremony in the chancel of the church of the hospital of St John. (The relics would seem to have previously been kept in a small 14th century chest, which has also survived).The new shrine was made of wood, based on a model in precious metal. It is in the form of a house or chapel, the pack-saddle roof of which is set with painted trompe-l'oeil ""tondi"". The decoration of pinnacles, gables, crockets, finials, interlacing and statuettes in niches, is in the finest flamboyant Gothic style. The six arched openings in the sides take the place of stained glass windows, and recount six episodes from the life of the saint as recorded by Jacques de Voragine in The Golden Legend Ursula was a Breton princess. She agreed to marry Eree, son of the pagan King of England, on the condition that he convert to Christianity. She was subsequently martyred for her faith at the hands of the Huns"

22935-02mornin.jpg	Much more comprehensible to his contemporaries, and truly typical of the century's interests, was Giuseppe Maria Crespi's Venetian pupil, Pietro Longhi. Without Lancret's charm and Hogarth's satiric bite, Longhi was closer a tattling journalist, observing life in Venice with mild, rather respectful, humour. Local patricians commissioned his little pictures which hold up to nature no more than a small hand-mirror, none too steadily, in which the more amiable surfaces of life are prettily reflected back. So many pages from an almanach, Longhi's pictures dutifully report the daily round of visits and coffee-drinking in patrician circles, and sewing and serving food in humbler milieux, and move out of doors to record carnival novelties.

32760-04oddi.jpg	The commission of this painting, originally intended for the Church of San Francesco al Monte in Perugia, was first awarded to Perugino, who entrusted it to his pupil.The altarpiece combines two scenes common in Quattrocento iconography: the Coronation (which occupies the upper part of the picture) and the Giving of the Girdle to St Thomas (in the lower part), an episode traditionally associated with the Assumption. The two scenes remain separate from one another, and this clear division of the composition may indicate the painter's uncertainty of his compositional abilities. Nevertheless, the forms are already mature and certain innovations in perspective - such as the diagonal representation of the Madonna's tomb - constitute a departure from traditional Quattrocento compositional types.Extant drawings demonstrate the tremendous amount of thought which Raphael put into the panel's realization and some details, notably the highly individual faces of the Apostles and the serene landscape in the background, are quite masterful. But the most meaningful passages are found in the predella scenes: the vast space which opens out beneath the colonnades of the Annunciation; the highly animated Adoration of the Magi; and the free quality of the atmosphere in the Presentation in the Temple, which foreshadows the extraordinary spatial intuition of some of the artist's future Vatican compositions

13663-scourgin.jpg	About the year 1500 a number of talented painters were at work in the principal cities of southern and central Spain. Their art is often eclectic, comprising both Northern and Italian elements, with the balance weighted somewhat in favour of the latter.In Seville some outstanding paintings were produced by Alejo Fern�ndez. In 1496 he is reported in C�rdoba, but soon afterward he moved to Seville, where he continued to live until his death in 1545. Strong in composition, Fern�ndez was particularly skillful in handling his figures, which are distributed with imagination and judgment and modeled with unusual grace.

It depicts aspic viper, sand lizard, tree frog, moths and fungi. The snake, emerging from the shadows of the undergrowth, is about to attack the frog. Its mouth is open, prepared to bite, and its wide eyes are fixed on its prey, which has its back turned, unaware of the imminent danger. The rest of the work is populated by a range of fungi, thistles and moths.

00417-4saints1.jpg	On the southwest wall opposite the St George cycle are four scenes depicting the work and martyrdom of St Catherine (in the upper register) and that of St Lucy (in the lower register). The picture shows the scenes St Catherine Liberated by an Angel from the Torture on the Wheel (top) and The Martyrdom of St Lucy (bottom).The first two pictures, dedicated to St Catherine, are in very poor condition; they show the saint appearing before Emperor Maxentius to condemn idolatry and her dispute with the philosophers summoned by the emperor and their conversion. These scenes are followed by the picture of an angel intervening to prevent Catherine's torture on the wheel and the beheading of the saint. Both scenes have parallels in the St George cycle, here, however, an oriental milieu, seen in the physiognomies, head coverings, and scimitars, is emphasized still more.The first Lucy scene in the lower register shows the steadfastness of the saint before the judge Paschasius, the second and unsuccessful attempt to have her brought to a brothel with a team of oxen. These scenes are followed by the martyrdom of the saint, and the concluding scene is her burial. In the martyrdom scene she survives torture by flame and boiling oil, unscathed, and is then stabbed to death

11961-allegr01.jpg	The Villa Allegri was built around 1656 by the Allegri family, nobility from Verona, on the site of a preexisting sixteenth-century structure. It was designed by the Veronese architect and sculptor Giovanni Battista Bianchi. The main hall of the villa and the adjoining oratory was decorated with frescoes by Louis Dorigny in c. 1719.The entire luminous, double height main hall is covered in trompe l'oeil architectural devices. The space is measured off by a double order of twin pilasters and columns that illusionistically support broad bays with flattened arches. These bays contain airy balconies, the balustrades of which hold displays of large vases brimming with multicoloured flowers. On the short sides of the room, flanked by boxes adorned with rose-coloured drapery and flower-filled vases, two imaginary spaces open up like stages, one shows Perseus Displaying the Head of Medusa, the other The Battle of the Centaurs and Lapiths. Below each of them is a virtuosic depiction of a pair of virile nudes engaged in a tenacious struggle, painted in imitation  of classical marble statues.The extraordinary upward thrust of the space is assured by the ceiling, which is divided into a complex system of transversal arches.

16586-1pitti.jpg	The picture shows the general view looking towards the north and west walls in the Sala Terreno (called the Room of Giovanni da San Giovanni) in the summer quarters of Ferdinando II de' Medici on the ground floor in the Palazzo Pitti.The Palazzo Pitti in Florence, purchased from the Pitti family by the wife of Duke CosimoI de' Medici in 1549 and renovated and expanded by Bartolommeo Ammanati, served as a residence of royal proportions for roughly 350 years. It was occupied by the dynasties of the Medici, the Habsburgs, and finally the Savoyards, and subjected to constant adaptations and alterations. Intensive use by ruling families resulted in the lavish decoration of all floors. Fresco painters from three centuries  contributed to the fixed decor of the public rooms and living quarters. Of its numerous apartments two suites of rooms stand out because of their decoration, function and size. These took their present form under Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici (1610-1670), and for the most part they were spared later encroachments owing to their high-quality frescoes. These are the reception rooms in the left (north) wing used by Ferdinando II. The rooms on the cooler ground floor, directly connected with the Boboli Gardens by way of a loggia and a terrace, served him as a summer apartment (Appartamento d'Estate); his winter quarters (Appartamento d'Inverno), reached by way of a large staircase and capable of being heated, lie directly above these on the piano nobile.Several different painters worked on the decoration of the large hall on the ground floor (Salone Terreno). Its virtuoso wealth of forms, the scenographic bravura of its architectural painting, and its strikingly original programmatic concept, makes the room an outstanding example of seventeenth-century Florentine painting, standing as it does between tradition and modernism. The east wall of the Salone and the ceiling was painted by Giovanni da San Giovanni in 1635-36, the south wall by Cecco Bravo in 1638, the west wall by Ottavio Vannini in 1639-41, and the north wall by Francesco Furini in 1640-42.The wall paintings deal with Lorenzo de' Medici and the return of the Golden Age under his rule

02936-carrying.jpg	The present composition - composed of two panels - was originally part of a large Crucifixion, which at some point in the past was broken up into smaller panels. Although five of these have been reunited in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection, most of the composition is still missing. The painting reveals a great interest in narrative and is built up through the accumulation of numerous different elements and incidents, whereby various episodes from the Passion take place at the same time: in the middle ground, Christ bearing the Cross takes the cloth which St Veronica offers Him. Behind this scene we see a hanged man, probably the traitor Judas. The various figures in the procession behind Christ are depicted in great detail, and the anecdotal nature of the painting is obvious in the figure who makes a mocking face at the Virgin and her followers

17017-nuenen37.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 82, JH 764.In Nuenen van Gogh was able to paint and draw more from the figure; the rural labourers of Brabant were often unemployed and, because they needed money, they agreed to pose for the painter. The most important work of this period in Nuenen was a multi-figure composition of peasants at home eating their meal - The Potato Eaters. The present picture shows the final version of the composition. Van Gogh considered it his most successful painting, and it was the only one of his paintings that he considered worth showing in public and the only one he could imagine taking its place in the tradition of Millet.The painting shows five people seated round a rough wooden table. The younger woman has a bowl of hot, steaming potatoes in front of her and is serving up portions. The old woman opposite her is pouring barley-malt coffee into cups. The three generations of a peasant family living together under one roof are gathered for this frugal meal. An oil lamp sheds a dim light on the scene, shedding its weak and flickering light on all of them equally.The picture was harshly criticized. Van Rappard, friend and fellow artist, questioned van Gogh's right to claim comparison with Millet. To answer this, van Gogh began a series of large drawings of men and women digging, cutting wood, gleaning - tasks which Millet had represented in his series of drawings, Labours of the Fields

24630-virgin2.jpg	The Virgin is seated in three-quarter profile on an imposing stone throne with Gothic ornamentation. Richly dressed in a dark red, fur-lined gown and a mantle bordered with pearl braiding, her head inclined in recollection, she holds the infant Jesus on her right arm. She appears to be meditating a passage in the book that Christ is thumbing. Their faces are surrounded by halos of golden rays. The Child, in a long white shirt, has seized the bookmark. Through an open window to the right of the throne we glimpse a building on the other side of a courtyard. The upper part of the window is decorated with a stained glass panel depicting St Catherine flanked by two escutcheons. A similar stained glass window to the left carries the figure of St Barbara.This painting, attributed to Quentin Massys, is part of the Madonna with Child group that the artist painted during his youth. The symmetrical composition, the hieratic presentation of the figures, the style of the Virgin's garments and the vigorous modelling of the draperies as well as the Gothic ornamentations all recall the tradition of the Flemish Primitives. The iconographic theme picks up the traditional image of Christ's incarnation. The Virgin in majesty is directly associated with the divine nature of her Son, the Word incarnate. Her meditative attitude and the red of her garments evoke the presentiment she had of her Child's destiny right from his birth.Massys' work refers back to earlier compositions that present Christ reading in the Virgin's arms. Two famous examples are Rogier van der Weyden's Madonna Dur�n (Madrid, Prado) and the Ince Hall Virgin attributed to a follower of Jan van Eyck (Melbourne, National Gallery of Victoria). With Massys we have the same monumental pose of the Virgin, with the niche-shaped throne similar to the one in Van der Weyden's painting. Even if the Brussels Madonna with Child shows how much the painter was part of the Flemish tradition, before coming under the influence of the Renaissance, it already contains the novel elements that were to make Massys the captivating and highly innovative artist whose talent would be fully revealed in his later works. With his exceptionally ample volumes, his supple shapes caressed by a strong, yet soft light, and the virtuoso translucency of his colouring technique, he carries the art of modelling forward to new heights

06593-5sense2.jpg	Jan 'Velvet' Brueghel was the most gifted painter of the Flemish school after Rubens. A painter of small pictures, his curiosity was aroused by a wide variety of natural objects - flowers, fruit, landscapes - and by human activity, ranging from peasants working in the fields to the mania of a collector.In this painting, which belongs to a series representing the Five Senses, Sight is shown in the form of an art and wonder chamber, as a kind of walk through a long gallery flooded by sunlight through its covered skylight windows, so that light is shown as the physical equivalent of visual perception. In the foreground a woman, as an allegory of 'visus' (sight), is sitting at a round table, somnolently looking at a painting. Sight, as one of the five senses, also includes astronomical implements such as the telescope and the astrolabe. The painting was executed in collaboration with Rubens, who painted the allegorical personifications on all panel of this series Five Senses

The two are linked by the cornice which, although it changes in its detailing, is essentially common to both scenes. The composition of Condemnation of St Lawrence by the Emperor Valerian owes much to Angelico's earlier sacra conversazione. The wall broken into sections by pilasters, hung with a rich ornamental curtain and incorporating a lofty architectural throne, is familiar from the Annalena altarpiece of a couple of years before. Various soldiers and city worthies stand in a circle before the Emperor, helping to create a sense of depth without the assistance of any converging orthogonals in the foreground

18196-0202grec.jpg	Small portable altarpiece with hinged wings, painted on both sides, of a type similar in form to others produced in Crete in the sixteenth century, but with an Italian Renaissance frame. The subjects on the front, from left to right, are the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Allegory of a Christian Knight, and the Baptism; and on the back, the Annunciation, Mount Sinai, and Adam and Eve.The central panel on the front, showing the Christian Knight received into Heaven, with Purgatory and Inferno below, and the three Theological virtues, is of medieval inspiration, and precisely follows a known representation of the subject. The Jaws of Hell are a specifically medieval motif. Saint Catherine, with the Wheel of her Martyrdom, appears below the figures of Christ and the Knight. The theme of Mount Sinai, on the back of the central panel, was of Cretan origin, and faithfully repeats a traditional Byzantine model. The reference to Saint Catherine in both the central panels has been suggested as a possible indication of the artist's connection in Crete with the monastery of Saint Catherine, a dependency of that of Mount Sinai, and the most important school of painting in the island. The other compositions are similarly not original, but here the artist has used engravings after Italian (mainly Venetian) compositions as his models. The repetition of traditional images was usual in Byzantine art.The Triptych is interesting as one of the earliest known work by El Greco. It clearly belongs to the time soon after his arrival in Italy. We see the artist acquainting himself with the new Italian subject matter and its treatment, and making his first essays in the new technique of Venice. The flat, linear, geometrical designs of Byzantine art give way to compositions employing rounder, more solid forms, and a looser handling. The somewhat nervous quality may be regarded as El Greco's own, and the Triptych does contain motifs and compositions that he later develops. The subjects of the Annunciation, Adoration of the Shepherds and Baptism inspire some of El Greco's grandest works. The Allegory of the Christian Knight is appropriately recollected in the Allegory of the Holy League. The Byzantine image of Mount Sinai is not unreasonably brought to mind in front of the late Toledo

00599-0view.jpg	Andrea was commissioned the Legnaia Famous Persons cycle no later than June 1449, when Filippo Carducci, the owner of the villa and most probably the one who commissioned the frescoes, died. The frescoes were finished before the house was sold in October 1451.The Legnaia cycle consists of nine portrayals (three Florentine military commanders, three famous women and three Tuscan poets), placed inside painted niches made to look like monumental marble recesses, separated by pilasters. On one of the room's short walls, the figures of Adam and Eve were painted.The picture shows a digital reconstruction by Lew Minter of the Famous Men and Women fresco cycle originally in the loggia of the Villa Carducci, Legnaia. The width of the loggia is approximately 15,5 m. The figures from he left are: Eve, Madonna and Child (over the door, largely lost), Adam (largely lost), Pippo Spano, Farinata degli Uberti, Niccol&#242; Acciaioli, Cumaean Sibyl, Queen Esther, Queen Tomyris, Dante, Petrarch. The third Florentine literary figure in the cycle, Boccaccio, next to Petrarch, is not shown in this reconstruction.

33626-13sp1640.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 34.Substantial things came out of Rembrandt's experience with nature. The softer chiaroscuro of the 1640s was probably formed upon his open-air studies, and their atmospheric qualities soon appear throughout his work. Even the portraits begin to gain in spaciousness and transparency of tonality, and in so doing they show a deeper understanding of the sitter within his environment. The Self-Portrait leaning on a Stone Sill of 1640 shows the new mood of the period as well as the new stylistic tendency. The artist still represents himself in precious attire, as he did formerly. He wears a richly embroidered shirt and an old-fashioned, heavy fur-trimmed velvet coat.More important, however, is the seriousness and reserve of the man who has abandoned all signs of sensational appeal to the spectator. The illumination serves to achieve a more objective rendering of his face. The arrangement of the figure is also changed. It is no longer close to the front plane, but recedes behind a stone sill. The figure has a firmer outline and can almost be inscribed into a pyramidlike shape having the sill as a base. Instead of stressing the sweeping curvilinear silhouettes of the 1630s, here Rembrandt repeatedly emphasized the horizontal: in the sill, the position of the arm leaning on it, the main accent of the face, and even the position of the cap. These repeated horizontals lend the picture stability, firmness, and calm.This is the period when classical influence makes a pronounced appearance in Dutch painting, and in this particular portrait we know of definite links with Italian Renaissance art. There are reminiscences of Raphael's portrait of Baldassare Castiglione, now in the Louvre, which Rembrandt had seen at an auction in Amsterdam in 1639. He made a quick pen sketch of it (Vienna, Albertina) and noted the price the picture fetched, as well as the total amount of the sale. In the same year Rembrandt based an etched self portrait on that sketch, but the London Self-Portrait of 1640 comes closer to the essence of Raphael's style than either the immediate sketch made after the Castiglione portrait or the etching.The buyer of Raphael's painting at the Amsterdam auction in 1639 was Alphonso L�pez, who worked as an agent in Holland for the French crown. In 1641 L�pez also owned Titian's so-called Ariosto (London, National Gallery) and Flora (Florence, Uffizi). There can be little doubt that Rembrandt had a chance to study both these pictures, as well as the Raphael. Titian's so-called Ariosto was as important as Raphael's Castiglione for his etched self portrait of 1639 and the London picture of 1640: the leaning posture on the sill and the prominence of the sleeve in both works are derived from it. As for L�pez's Flora by Titian, distinct traces are in Rembrandt's lovely Portrait of Saskia with a Flower of 1641 (Dresden, Gem&#228;ldegalerie)

19749-hamlet.jpg	Hobbema's fame rests on a group of landscapes painted between 1662 and 1668, most of which are composed along similar lines to the present example, with a hamlet of thatched timber-framed farmhouses nestling under oak trees growing in thin, sandy soil			
09013-08mill.jpg	In the 1640s Claude produced many of his most ambitious pictures, such as the two versions of the Landscape with Dancing Figures (sometimes called The Mill) in the Galleria Doria in Rome and the National Gallery, London (called The Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca). They are wide in scale and the atmosphere is of broad daylight. There is a complete balance between careful observation of the reality of the Roman Campagna and the need to produce an organized composition. Unfortunately both versions of the picture suffer from a problem afflicting a number of Claude's works, the darkening of the greens in the trees. This gives them a much greater solidity than the artist intended. Moreover, in Claude's later pictures there is also sometimes a fading out of the fugitive yellows he used, which gives the pictures a much stronger bluish hue than he intended.Painted in 1648, these two pictures sum up Claude s mature art. He had arrived at this maturity by degrees, almost imperceptibly, refining and perfecting his technique. He had for many years been drawing from nature almost obsessively, and several hundred of his sensitive and often atmospheric drawings survive. He was therefore able to combine the more naturalistic approach seen in the Ponte Molle of 1645 with an increasing desire to turn the landscape into an idealized world. He had tried dramatic atmosphere in some of his early compositions, and had succeeded with direct sunlight but had not pursued it; but he developed in his later years the soft and subtle light effects which were the most difficult of all to achieve convincingly. As he grew older Claude became even more meticulous, and his pictures never acquired the looseness sometimes seen in the works of painters in their old age, even Poussin.The painting was executed for Prince Pamphilj and it is by descent in the Doria Pamphilj family.The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 113)

07555-38crowni.jpg	This picture creates a different kind of drama than the Crowning with Thorns in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The vertical format allows us to concentrate on Christ, who occupies the centre of the picture. The figure of a man, naked from the waist up, sitting on a chair in front of a barrier in the foreground, holding the rope with which Christ's hands are bound, leads the eye towards him. A second man in a brilliant red robe is almost gently gripping the victim by his upper body and upper left arm. A third assistant is pressing the crown down so hard on to Christ's head with his stick that a drop of blood is running down his temple.The version in Vienna is the earlier, its attribution to Caravaggio is disputed. The attribution of the present, later version is also debated. Formerly it was considered to be a copy after a lost Caravaggio painting, now it is thought that the figure of Christ is by Caravaggio himself, the three assailants on both sides of Christ are by studio assistants

17768-501goya.jpg	Goya's Majas (fashionable young women) are two of his most famous and most discussed masterpieces. Their date, for whom they were painted and the identity of the model are problems that are still not satisfactorily solved. The first mention of The Nude Maja is in the diary of the medallist Pedro Gonzalez de Sepulveda describing a visit in November 1800 to the house of the Minister, Manuel Godoy, Goya's patron and the target of his satire: 'In an apartment or inner cabinet are pictures of various Venuses... [among them] a naked one by Goya, without design or delicacy of colouring' and Vel�zquez's 'famous Venus'. There is no mention of The Clothed Maja and presumably it was not there, probably not yet painted.Godoy's position at court and his known taste for paintings of female nudes (there were many others in his collection) makes it likely that both Majas were painted for him. An alternative suggestion is that they were in the Duchess of Alba's collection and acquired by Godoy after her death, together with Vel�zquez's The Toilet of Venus and other pictures. Goya's relations with the Duchess of Alba have made her the most popular candidate as a model for the Majas, at least as a source of inspiration, supported by the many drawings of herself and members of her household he made during his visit to the Duchess's country estate. The lack of resemblance to the heads of Goya's earlier portraits of her is usually explained by the need to conceal her identity. Whoever the model may have been and for whomever the pictures were made, Goya's nude Maja is unique and unprecedented in his oeuvre and in Spain, even in Europe, in his time. Vel�zquez's Venus, which Goya must have seen in the Duchess of Alba's collection, is its only comparable predecessor in the life-like portrayal of the female nude. But where the Vel�zquez is also a mythological painting, Goya's The Nude Maja makes no pretence of being anything but the rendering of a naked woman lying on a couch

18223-0404grec.jpg	"The earliest reference to the painting appears in Francisco de los Santos, Descripci�n . . . del Escorial, published in 1657, when it was in the sacristy of the Pantheon: ' . . . commonly called the ""Glory of El Greco"" on account of the Glory above, but there is also represented, below, Purgatory and Hell, and on the other side, the Church Militant, with an immense number of the Faithful in adoration, raising their hands and eyes to Heaven, and among them Philip II; in the middle of the Glory is the Name of Jesus adored by Angels . . . signifying the words of Saint Paul In Nomine Jesu omne genu, flectatur Caelestium, Terrestrium, &#38; Infernorum' (Saint Paul, Epistle to the Philippians, II, 10).The subject, then, is the Adoration of the Name of Jesus, a Jesuit counterpart of the Adoration of the Lamb, and incorporates the 'Church Militant', represented by the Holy League.  The Name of Jesus is represented by the trigram IHS with a cross above that appears in a burst of glory at the top of the composition. The painting has also been called An Allegory of the Holy League because of the presence of the main participants of the Holy League. The popular title, the 'Dream of Philip II', is more recent.The painting must certainly have been made for Philip II, but no documents refer to it and it is strangely not mentioned by Sig�enza in his description of the Escorial, published in 1608. The occasion of the commission may well have been the death of Juan of Austria in 1577, and the translation of his body to the Pantheon in 1578. The painting was in the Pantheon when los Santos described it. Juan of Austria was the general in charge of the forces of the Holy League at the victory of Lepanto in 1571.The three members of the Holy League, Spain, Venice and the Papal States are represented by the three kneeling figures of Philip II, Doge Mocenigo and Pope Pius V, and the one prominent figure of the foreground group, kneeling in heroic pose, and holding a sword, can represent no other than the general in charge at Lepanto. It is an ideal representation, while the King, Pope and Doge are actual portraits. Sir Anthony Blunt first suggested that this Adoration of the Name of Jesus was an allegory of the Holy League (the 'Church Militant'), and was possibly commissioned for the tomb of the Spanish General in the Pantheon. That is, it was more in the nature of a private commission for the King, and not part of the scheme of decoration of the Escorial. This could explain the absence of documents.The spirit of universal adoration is brilliantly conveyed. For the general arrangement of the painting, El Greco seems, appropriately, to have referred to his Allegory of a Christian Knight, of the Modena Triptych. The figures of the King, Pope, Doge and Juan of Austria take the place of the three Theological Virtues. The Jaws of Hell and the representation of Purgatory are very similar. The figure of Don Juan of Austria is inspired by Michelangelo. So special a commission could hardly have been the subject of a test-piece for the Escorial as has generally been suggested. The Martyrdom of Saint Maurice and His Legions was a specific commission (and the only commission) for the Escorial.There is a reduced autograph version of the painting in the National Gallery, London"

06555-fl_fair1.jpg	In his monograph on Brueghel, Ertz divides the numerous landscapes in the oeuvre into seven types on the basis of composition. The Flemish Fair belongs to the fourth type or Nah-Fern-Landschaft (literally, 'near-far-landscape'), which the artist employed from 1600-19. Such compositions incorporate a specific scene in the foreground connected with an enclosed space, which in the present painting is a village dominated by a church, balanced on the other side by a distant view. Comparable pictures of this type listed by Ertz are Landscape with a Pack Train and A Busy Country Road (Munich, Alte Pinakothek). Brueghel's achievement is to have depicted a continuous landscape, with meticulously observed details on the left (note the birds visible in the branches of the trees) complemented by the superbly handled atmospheric blue tones that evoke a landscape of melting beauty on the right. The vigorous characterisation of the figures in the foreground recalls the work of the artist's father, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, but it is interesting to observe that several sections of society are represented and not just peasants

26053-14flore2.jpg	The donor kneels on the far left behind a low wall. The stereometric planning and consistency with which Memling sets down his architectural features is characteristic. The stable of the Magi scene is shown from the rear in the left wing of the Floreins triptych. Every element tallies: the pilasters, the corbels, the beams, the little transverse roof and the hole in the thatching. The perspective of the left wing has two vanishing points with a viewpoint shifted to the right. That of the central panel is frontal, with a viewpoint moved slightly to the left, as is the case in the Columba altarpiece. Despite this, Memling placed the Virgin in the middle, directly in front of a column.The myth of the sick Memling who portrayed himself wearing a patient's bonnet and peering through the window on the right of the central panel arose during the eighteenth century.As in the St John altarpiece, the name of the artist and the date are included in an inscription in classical Roman capitals on the original frame. Memling used this classical typography - no different from that of Bellini or Mantegna - in several of his works. It is a very early, if not the earliest, example of humanist script in the Low Countries

32873-4virtue2.jpg	"The lunette containing the Cardinal Virtues (which represent ""Good "") is built around an allegorical theme. The volumetric modelling of the figures suggests the influence of Michelangelo. The relationship that binds the three figures together is clear and harmonic. Fortitude, dressed in armor, sits in the shade of an oak tree. Prudence is placed on the highest step of the base. She has two faces: one of a young woman who looks at her reflection in a mirror handed to her by a winged putto; the other, of an old man, the symbol of old age, of which prudence is the chief quality. Finally, Temperance is represented holding a pair of reins.The allegory was intended to include the figure of Justice as well. But Justice, being considered superior to the other virtues from a hierarchical point of view, is represented separately in one of the medallions of the vault. Three winged genii symbolize the theological virtues (Charity, gathering the fruits of the oak; Hope, in the centre with a flaming torch; and Faith, at the extreme right, pointing toward the sky). Two additional putti complete the composition, giving the whole scene a free and graceful movement"

43180-selfport.jpg	The daughter and pupil of a minor Parisian painter, Louis Vig�e, Madame Vig�e-Lebrun was an attractive and charming woman, who specialised in the attractive and charming portrayal of women and children while remaining a competent portraitist of men. Eighteenth-century notions of graceful spontaneity may strike twentieth-century viewers as arch or sentimental; nevertheless, she pioneered a new style. Her fashionable portraits in the simplified dress called &#224; la grecque dispense with Baroque props of columns or curtains to demonstrate 'natural' manners and feelings, anticipating the Neo-classical portraits of David.Madame Vig�e-Lebrun fled the French Revolution in 1789, avoiding the fate of her most illustrious patron, Queen Marie-Antoinette, to become an international success in the capitals of Europe. She returned to her native city after the Restoration in 1814 and gave an account of her early life and later tribulations and triumphs in the highly readable, if unreliable, Memoirs published in 1835.The painter Claude Joseph Vernet, she recalls, advised her to study the Italian and Flemish masters but above all to follow nature. This picture is an autograph replica of a self portrait painted in Brussels in 1782 which wittily records her admiration of a famous Flemish masterpiece, Rubens's Portrait of Susanna Lunden, known as the 'Chapeau de Paille'. '[Its] great effect', she wrote, 'resides in the two different kinds of illumination which simple daylight and the light of the sun create...This painting...has inspired me to the point that I made my own portrait...in search of the same effect.'The bright gleam and the general radiance of direct and reflected outdoor light as represented in Rubens's picture are indeed carefully noted, but Madame Vig�e-Lebrun takes care also to record her debt to nature. She shows herself in the open against a cloud-flecked sky, and - not surprisingly since she is both sitter and painter - as almost a personification of the art of painting. For this fictitious excursion into the fields, but also to demonstrate her powers of observation, she wears a genuine chapeau de paille, unlike Rubens's sitter whose hat is actually made of beaver felt. To the dashing ostrich feather she has added a wreath of freshly picked rustic flowers. Her hair is her own, not a wig, and is left unpowdered. Where Susanna Lunden modestly crosses her arms above her waist and peers out from below her hat, Madame Vig�e-Lebrun extends her unaffected friendship to the viewer. Most natural of all, however, is her charming bosom. For unlike Rubens's beauty, whose breasts are moulded by her tight corset, Madame Vig�e-Lebrun lets it plainly be seen in her low d�colletage that she has no need of such artifice

10688-triptych.jpg	In the centre the Mary with Child on an ornamented throne, on the left the birth of Jesus, on the left the crucifixion, while above the side panels the annuciation can be seen. The triptych is a small home altarpiece but the style has fresco-like monumentality, showing the influence of Giotto, the master of Daddi.As a Florentine painter Daddi was undoubtedly influenced by Giotto. His figures therefore have a monumentality and dignity worthy of that master, but Daddi was also aware of contemporary Sienese painting, especially the works of Ambrogio and Pietro Lorenzetti, which invested his style with a lyricism and an incandescent sense of colour that give his smaller panels a remarkable intensity. The artist is seen at his best in works on this compact scale, especially in the portable triptychs of which several examples have survived. It is now recognised that these works introduced what has been called 'the miniaturist tendency' into Florentine painting, a style that prevailed until just after the middle of the century with the emergence of Andrea Orcagna. Daddi, therefore, holds a position of singular importance in the development of Florentine art

36454-abbot.jpg	Savoldo was a Lombard painter who settled in Venice in about 1520. He visited Florence and the monumentality of his painted figures manifests the influence of Michelangelo's works in Florence. His style can be differentiated from the Venetian style in spite of the seemingly similar compositions. He influenced the late style of Titian and Jacopo Bassano and he played an important role in the formation of Caravaggio's art.A good example of his style is St Anthony Abbot and St Paul, in which the light shines from the right and glances off the figures, utterly human in their lifelike concreteness and completely alien to the canons of ideal beauty and perfect harmony obtained in the early sixteenth century

07668-carlev12.jpg	This magnificent view of the Molo originally formed part of a set of four views of Venice, which are believed to have been purchased circa 1710-1715 by Christopher Crowe, British Consul in Leghorn. It presents a view of the Molo with the Doge's Palace looking west towards the Zecca and the church of Santa Maria della Salute in the distanceThis painting, like its companions, is impressive for its highly sophisticated rendering of a site that would have been extremely familiar to visitors of Venice. The scene is populated by over one hundred colourful, individually defined figures and the spectacular architectural setting is unified by a warm, soft light that is both naturalistic and atmospheric.

00938-60bosco.jpg	This altarpiece was painted by Angelico after his return from Rome for the Franciscan convent of Bosco ai Frati in Mugello. It was probably commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici who started the renovation of the convent in 1438. The altarpiece represents the Virgin and Child enthroned with two angels, and Sts Anthony of Padua, Louis of Toulouse and Francis (on the left), as well as Sts Cosmas, Damian and Peter Martyr (on the right).The altarpiece shows further developments of the formula that underlies his earlier sacra conversazione. The architecture is richer and more plastic, so that its articulation of the picture space is partly camouflaged. The throne has been widened and heightened, now looking like the apse of a small church, bringing greater emphasis to the Virgin and Child at the expense of the saints. The wall is enlivened by a series of recessions and projections in the form of niches and half ionic columns. Although the grass and flowers have been excluded from the foreground, the natural world reasserts itself, albeit in a symmetrical composition, behind the wall

07199-canal401.jpg	In the central distance can be seen the dome of the Salute and the masts of a number of large ships moored in the Bacino, while at the right is the church of Santa Maria della Carit&#224;, which also features prominently in 'The Stonemason's Yard'. It was converted into the city's art gallery &#151; the Accademia delle Belle Arti &#151; in the nineteenth century. This view looks very different today because the foreground is dominated by the modern Accademia bridge and the bell tower no longer exists. The appearance of the impressive palace on the far side of the canal, the Palazzo Cavalli, has also been altered.This painting is a good illustration of Canaletto's achievement as a subtle colourist; he has effectively contrasted the powder-blue sky with the green water and the tan and orange brickwork and roof-tiles. In addition he has created formal interest by carefully observing how the Scuola to the far right of the picture casts diagonal shadows across the fa�ade of the church. This work was owned by Joseph Smith and while in his collection it was engraved by Visentini as part of the Prospectus Magni Canalis series of prints

39491-08soranz.jpg	This fine example of Tintoretto's portraits is a fragment of a larger work which contains other portraits and dates from not long after the other portrayal of Jacopo Soranzo in the possession of the Castello Sforzesco in Milan. No longer governed by precepts of Renaissance portraiture this painting exemplifies, an immeddiacy of interpretation and a penetrating understanding of the psychology of the sitter. In the portrait of Soranzo the brush strokes build up the features of the face with extraordinary precision, subtle effects of light evoking the leanness of the flesh, the burning eyes, the hair and beard of the subject. A sudden light forces Soranzo out of the shadow and he appears to be engaged in an intense conversation with the observer, revealing to him his innermost human and spiritual emotions. The rapid expressionistic way in which the character is conveyed is very different from the idealized dignity which Titian confers upon his powerful contemporaries in his portraits of them.Soranzo was to die in the following year, but his shrewd, dignified old age is unclouded by dark forebodings

30413-steccatd.jpg	Parmigianino brilliant career in Rome was cut short by the city's infamous Sack in 1527. Initially retreating to Bologna, he returned to Parma in 1530, where he received a commission to decorate the vaults and the main apse of a new, centrally planned church dedicated to the Virgin, the Madonna della Steccata. This project gave him the opportunity to refine Correggio's illusionistic effects and promote an even more elegant and graceful style which allied his patrons with the most sophisticated developments in contemporary Roman art.In the church Parmigianino transformed the broad barrel vault in front of the main apse into a sumptuous gilt, blue, and red field which seems to be bounded by protruding arches overlaid with interlacing gilt strapwork. Only the bosses at the centre of the coffers are actually three-dimensional, every other figure, niche, and decorative detail is a fiction. The three female figures performing a balletic balancing act on a fictive ledge carry empty lamps which characterize them as the unprepared Foolish Virgins of one of Christ's parables; their wise, mirror-image counterparts appear on the opposite side of the vault

20433-coronati.jpg	On a huge multilevel Gothic double throne, Mary sits on Jesus' right, while he places a crown on her head with his right hand. The multitude of figures restrained by the strict frames of architecture emphasize the rigid ceremoniousness of the scene. On the right, patriarchs and apostles, on the left prophets and martyrs, below saints and holy virgins are lined up; they can be recognized by the scrolls in their hands. The most direct participants in the event are the evangelists within the cells of the throne structure and the musical angels in the front. The choir of angels form the mainstay of the heavenly court. There are nine of them in the first row. The two on the ends hold incense-burners, the other have musical instruments. While the others standing behind them cannot be classified into the nine orders of angelic hierarchy, it is certain that those standing on either side of Mary and Jesus are cherubs and seraphs.The seven musical angels are the personification of an exuberant panegyric as they reflect the ceremonial mood of Mary's reception into heaven. Their instruments - two nearly identical psalteries, a viola, a portative organ, a harp, a tambourine and a lute - are mere attributes; they do not constitute a real orchestra. Characteristically, the painter did not use a single wind instrument.The thin row of flowers at the bottom of the painting indicates that the location is the Garden of Eden. The donor of the work, Antonio Correr, the bishop of Ceneda, kneels in the right foreground. He commissioned this work for the high altar of the church from the aging master in whose works we can detect the Byzantine traits of Venetian Gothic. When he worked on this painting, he was probably inspired by Guariento's fresco on the same subject, completed in 1365 for the great council hall (Sala del Maggior Consiglio) of the Palazzo Ducale

20088-14hooch.jpg	Pieter de Hooch, born in Rotterdam in 1629 and trained in the Haarlem studio of the landscape painter Nicolaes Berchem, came to Delft in 1652. In the following year he was said to be in the service - both as a servant and a painter - of Justus de la Grange, a cloth merchant. De Hooch married in Delft in May 1654 and joined the painters' guild in September 1655. He remained in the town until 1661, when he moved to Amsterdam. In his early years De Hooch had painted scenes of soldiers and guardrooms but after his move to Delft turned to genre scenes showing young men and women eating, drinking, playing musical instruments and flirting in well-appointed interiors. These are based on actual rooms in the houses of prosperous Delft citizens, carefully described in an effective empirical perspective.The earliest dated examples of De Hooch's Delft interiors are from 1658. He also painted a small number of closely related exterior scenes of which this painting, also from 1658, is the most outstanding example. It is unlikely to be a precisely accurate view as De Hooch used many of the same architectural elements in a second painting, also dated 1658, in which the right-hand side of the painting - where the maid and the child stand - was transformed to show a bower constructed with trellis-work beneath which two seated men and a standing woman drink and smoke. Both compositions are presumably based on quiet corners of Delft with which De Hooch was familiar. These and other paintings of De Hooch's Delft years evoke a world of quiet, domestic contentment, of pleasure taken in the performance of simple household tasks and in the appearance of well-ordered surroundings. It is an art which celebrates simple virtues, the efficient running of the home and the conscientious raising of children

35720-view_hab.jpg	"Jacob van Ruisdael was one of the most significant landscapists of the seventeenth century, the Golden Age of Dutch art. He created several ""icons"" in the field, whose message goes far beyond the beauty and poetry of the landscape panorama and the objective, topographical rendering of excerpts from nature to take on symbolic force.This is especially true of his superb Landscape with a View of Haarlem. From the elevated position of the dunes to the northwest of Haarlem, the eye catches sight of the red-tinged roofs of the town, the mighty structure of Saint Bavo and the other churches, the town hall and, at the edge of the town, the many windmills on the ramparts. The cloudy sky, reaching up from a low horizon, is reflected in the flat countryside in the interplay of strips of light and shadow. Long linen cloths are spread out to bleach on the meadows in the foreground - at the time of the painting linen manufacture was an important industry of the town. Ruisdael accorded the bleaching of linen an important place in nearly all his 'Haarlempjes', about 20 of which have survived.Allegorical interpretations of Landscape with a View of Haarlem, which go beyond the topographical and refer to the virtue of the purity of the soul, cannot be excluded. Goethe had already characterized Ruisdael as a 'poet' and admired the 'perfect symbolism' in his works. The combination of a composition drawing on nature and an ambitious statement in terms of content is indeed one of the most important stylistic features of Ruisdael, in whose art Dutch landscape painting of the 17th century reached its impressive peak"

38582-rainbow.jpg	At the beginning of the 1640s Teniers began to develop his own pictorial language in the genre of landscape painting. He focused his attention on the Flemish countryside as a subject itself worthy of his attention, and not merely as a backdrop to his outdoor genre scenes. In the present landscape he includes wispy, dark clouds, with streaking rays of light piercing in from various directions through rain, and a rainbow in the left background.

12337-guardroo.jpg	Duck represents the guardroom tradition in Utrecht. He prefers large crowds gathered in spacious halls and exploits all the tricks known to artists of his time to create the illusion of space: curtains or large piles of weaponry in the foreground to set the front plane, an emphasis on the orthogonal lines made by the tiles or boards on the floor, vistas into rooms beyond the one in which the main action takes place, and aerial perspective. If mutual influence is a criterion, he was as unimpressed by the Utrecht follower  of Caravaggio as they were by him. His subjects range from boorish episodes in taverns to a lovely picture of a woman ironing in a kitchen (Centraal Museum, Utrecht).Concerning this painting in Budapest, although the soldiers are playing cards they are fully dressed, wearing hats and boots, their swords, breast-plates and banner in readiness beside them. The grey, undecorated walls of the guardroom suggest the discipline and boredom of their lives, the monotony of which can be relieved only by practice on the drum. The genre painters preferred not to show soldiers on guard - perhaps because they seemed ill at ease when performing this duty

13571-0view2.jpg	The sixteenth century lacks almost entirely what accounted for a large part of secular decorations of the fifteenth century, namely the depiction of aristocratic society's pastimes: hunting, gambling, banquets, dances and concerts. There are scenes of such activities in the Villa Caldogno and several other villas in the Veneto, but few other comparable examples. When such themes were treated, they were typically either part of a cycle devoted to historical events of the recent past or dressed in antique, mythological, or historical garb.The Villa Caldogno (also known as Caldogno Nordera) was built by Palladio for the aristocratic Caldogno family on their estate in the village of Caldogno near Vicenza.

44762-margaret.jpg	The painting is probably a portrait of a lady dressed as shepherdess. The serpent is the attribute of the saint.The apocryphal legend of the life and death of Margaret of Antioch was known in the western world as early as the 7th century. Cast out by her heathen father, she was martyred in the Diocletian persecution of Christians and decapitated. In the course of the centuries, more and more legends grew up around this popular martyr. Zurbar�n has portrayed her with straw hat and staff, in the costume of a Spanish shepherdess. Behind her we see the dragon which she is said to have overcome with the sign of the cross. Completely inactive, with the Bible in her left hand and a woven shepherd's bag over her arm, she gazes at the spectator with a sweetly childish face. This painting does not tell the turbulent episodes of her life, but shows a saintly woman revered in the home country of the painter

39343-02moses.jpg	This painting is on the ceiling of the Sala Superiore.After finishing the central canvas on the ceiling of the Upper Hall Tintoretto immediately began to carry out the two large side paintings at the beginning of 1577. In this painting, which clearly alludes to the task of the Brothers of the Scuola of quenching the thirst of the poor, Moses, by his clothes and pose, recalls the figure of Christ and the water gushing from the rock symbolizes the blood that flows from the side of the Son of God. At the centre of the canvas, Moses strikes a rock and powerful streams of water erupt from it, filling plates, bowls, and jars held out eagerly by the parched Israelites. God the Father, borne aloft on a supernatural crystal globe, comes in haste to save his thirsty people. The water struck by Moses from the rock for the Israelites seems to be spurting toward the viewer past the leaves of a fig tree. In the background is yet another threat: the Amalekites are attacking the camp of the children of Israel. The Lord observes from above.To care for the health and nourishment of the poor, the common denominator between the three great ceiling paintings, was among the principal social obligations of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco

17132-arles54.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 486, JH 1620.During his three-month stay in Arles Gauguin encouraged van Gogh to abandon his predominantly Naturalist aesthetic principles, his need to paint directly from the motif. Gauguin argued that the artist should experiment more freely with the motif, using devices such as flattened areas of pure colour and a more decorative and abstracted line. He had brought with him examples of �mile Bernard's recent work in this direction. Van Gogh, desirous of keeping up with his fellow vanguardists, was at first willing to experiment along similar lines.In this painting of the Alyscamps at Arles, a long tree-lined pathway bordered by Roman sarcophagi, van Gogh has adopted an oblique viewpoint which angles our vision down and across the promenade, excluding the sky and blocking any perspective into the distance. Trees, grass and pathway are painted in solid, heightened colours. The shapes are heavily and decoratively outlined. The scene is also a response to Bernard's work in another way. It is a scene of modern urban leisure. Here the bourgeois of Arles display themselves in a public promenade. Van Gogh has included a fashionably dressed female figure in red. She stands in sharp colouristic opposition to the predominant green of the trees and the grass

10759-compton.jpg	This painting was formerly thought to have been painted by Allan Ramsay. The sitter has variously been called Lady Anne Compton, Countess of Northampton, who died aged 22 in 1763, and Lady Elizabeth Compton, Countess of Northampton, who died in 1741. As the portrait must date approximately to 1780, it is most likely that the sitter is in fact the former's daughter, Lady Elizabeth Compton (1760-1835), who married Lord George Cavendish, later created 1st Earl of Burlington (1754-1834), in 1782. She was painted by Reynolds in 1781 (National Gallery of Art, Washington), and also sat to both Hoppner and Romney

18208-0301grec.jpg	Like his other devotional paintings executed on panel, El Greco almost certainly painted this picture as an image for private and intimate contemplation.

32801-34ardin.jpg	The so-called La Belle Jardini�re, now in the Louvre,  is one of the several Madonna paintings executed by Raphael during his stay in Florence (1504-1508). It follows the Madonna of the Goldfinch (Uffizi, Florence) chronologically. Its composition is a mirror image of that of the Madonna of the Meadow (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). The painting was commissioned by Fabrizio Sergardi, a Sienese nobleman, and was left uncompleted by the artist. Nevertheless, it is signed and dated. According to tradition it was finished by Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, although the recent restoration would seem to contradict this attribution. It was subsequently acquired by Francis I of France. The painting is known primarily for the harmonic and proportional balancing of the poses of the figures and for the high formal quality present in every element, particularly in the face of the Virgin, which served as a model of beauty for generations of artists.This painting is the highpoint of all Raphael's Florentine Madonnas. The bodies occupy the space with great freedom, while the figures interact with deep feeling. The arch formed by the frame completes the composition harmoniously. Raphael put the date of the picture into the hem of the Virgin's mantle, as he often did, but it is not clear if the Roman numerals are meant to be read as 1507 or 1508

These seemingly different themes have one major element in common: movement. They both allowed Degas to explore that which interested him the most: a body in motion. He had a passion for the world of music and opera and his paintings of the stage broke new ground.His first paintings from the theatre were portraits. In The Orchestra at the Opera, Degas portrayed a number of musicians seated in the orchestra pit, among them such friends as the composer Emmanuel Chabrier, the flautist Joseph-Henri Alt�s, the cellist Pillet, the first violinist Lancien, the violist Gouff�, and the bassoonist D�sir� Dihau.

43857-oriental.jpg	Jan Baptist Weenix was a versatile Italianate painter. He is best known for his views of the Campagna with emphasis on a mother and child seen against massive classical ruins, and fanciful Mediterranean seaports, but he also painted histories, portraits, and indoor genre scenes as well as some remarkable still-lifes with dead game. His son and pupil Jan Weenix made a speciality of pictures of hunting trophies. Jan Baptist Weenix arrived in Rome in 1642-43 where he enjoyed the patronage of 'Kardinaal Pamfilio', who has been variously identified as Cardinal Giovanni Battista Pamphilj, who became Pope Innocent X in 1644, and as the Pope's nephew Cardinal Camillo Pamphilj. After he returned to Holland in 1646-47 he invariably signed himself Gio[vanni] Batt[ist]a Weenix. His adoption of the Italian translation of his Christian name and patronymic may have been in honour of Innocent X who gave him at least one commission

16833-madchild.jpg	This little painting, designed to be used in private devotion, shows a foreshortening of the interior similar to that employed in Giulio's Madonna of the Cat (Naples, Museo Nazionale), a work that is directly connected to the composition of the Madonna of the Pearl (Museo del Prado). Though Vasari gave the latter picture to the hand of Raphael, it was instead probably carried out after the master's death by his pupil Giulio Romano. In both the Madonna of the Cat and in this small panel, the artist decided to set the scene with a domestic background instead of the more usual open landscape. This lends a tender family atmosphere that enhances the already intimate scale of this painting.The idealized female figure, comparable to similar figures in numerous other works of Giulio Romano, is related to the ideal model of Raphael. Her specific features have been identified as those of Raphael's own lover, known to us from his paintings of the veiled Lady (Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence) and the Fornarina (Palazzo Barberini).This painting, which clearly belongs to Giulio Romano's Roman period, has been dated to 1522-23. A copy exists in the Brera Gallery in Milan

34190-jerome.jpg	The image of St Jerome, one of the four Fathers of the Church and a favourite subject of popular religious devotion, was also one of Ribera's favourite themes. In fact, according to the most recent historiography, he painted forty-four different versions of this subject.In this painting the saint looks up from his writing, believing that he has heard the sound of the trumpet of doom. A scream seems to be issuing from his mouth and reaches us as if in a dream: there is no sound and yet it can be heard.The date on the painting has been wrongly read as 1629 or 1639, whereas it is undoubtedly 1637 (the year in which Ren� Descartes published his Discours de la m�thode). This is the period in which the majority of his signed and dated works were produced and thus marks the peak of the career of this artist of Spanish origin, who was active chiefly in Naples and had close ties with the culture of that city. In that year the painter, aged forty-six, started to work for the monks of the Charterhouse of San Martino, for whom he produced his most remarkable works, including the Piet&#224; located in the sacristy of that church.The choice of humble models, the warm light, the thick and soft paint, the lively colours, the exaggerated chiaroscuro, and the crude and impassioned realism of his interpretation of dramatic events form the basis of his popularity. But above all it was through his unflinching immersion in the tragic reality of humanity that Ribera's art came, with Luca Giordano serving as an intermediary, to influence the esthetics of the Venetian tenebrosi

19862-2guildf2.jpg	The second wife of Sir Henry Guildford, Mary Wotton had herself painted with a book of hours and a rosary. These attributes are formal references to a wife's piety, while the man is endowed with the attributes of worldly power. Although the panels are slightly different in size, they were conceived as a matching pair, as is indicated by the curtain pole that runs through both pictures and their matching blue backgrounds, decorated with the branches of vines.The preparatory drawing for this portrait is still held in Basel, which may indicate why the harsher lighting and greater linearity of the painting recalls Holbein's earlier European style. In comparison with the More family portraits, there is a stark flatness in the modelling of the plump sitter, whose figure is less comfortably integrated with the background. There is less interest in the texture of material (especially in the head dress), and awkward elements such as the grotesque head on the pillar seem to parody Lady Guildford herself. Holbein resorts to architectural as well as natural forms to rein in the composition, but despite the iron stanchion at the back and the receding perspectival column and pillars, ambiguities in space are unresolved at the far left and bottom right. Only the depiction of the sitter's arms and hands seems to have engaged the artist's full attention and powers

28923-portduke.jpg	Inevitably influenced by the example of Titian, yet making quite a distinctive contribution to their genre, were the portraits by Giovanni Battista Moroni, a painter working in the town of Bergamo on the western fringe of Venice's mainland empire. One of this finest is the Portrait of Don Gabriel de la Cueva, later Duke of Alburquerque, in which the pose of the Spanish nobleman - soon to become governor of the nearby city of Milan - is lent grandeur by the abstract geometry of the architectural foil behind him. Moroni's handling of paint is thinner and drier than that of Titian, and parts of the costume are rendered with an attention to detail that by this date had become foreign to the pictorial tradition of Venice itself

38461-funeral.jpg	This fresco is located on the north wall of the Cappella dei Signori in the Palazzo Pubblico.The Cappella dei Signori was constructed in about 1404-05 on the first floor of the Palazzo Pubblico, next to the important Sala del Mappamondo. As soon as the Cappella dei Signori was finished, the government commissioned Taddeo di Bartolo to paint its walls and vaulting, paying him for the work at regular intervals between 1406 and 1408.The north wall of the chapel is embellished with four large mural paintings depicting events surrounding the death of the Virgin - the arrival of the apostles at her death bed, Christ receiving her soul at the moment of her death, the funeral procession to her burial site and Christ raising the body of the Virgin from her tomb. The Funeral of the Virgin in particular offers a sense of Taddeo di Bartolo's considerable abilities as a painter of narrative: the foreground is occupied by an impressive procession of monumentally conceived figures of different ages, genders and ethnic types. In the background, meanwhile, appears an assured view of a walled city, the buildings of which resemble those of Siena itself, yet making an implicit parallel between the holy city of Jerusalem and Siena

14939-6pould09.jpg	In October 1889 Gauguin returned to Le Pouldu, where he stayed at the inn of Marie Henry with Meyer de Haan. Shortly after their arrival, they began to decorate the inn's dining room. The present work is part of the suite of decorative panels, along with the Caribbean Woman with Sunflowers. It formed the door of a cupboard with a portrait of Meyer de Haan opposite. These two works need to be read as a pair in order to appreciate the wealth of symbols they embody.This Self-Portrait with elements of caricature is one of Gauguin's most important and radical paintings. In it the painter seems to be melancholic. The background is filled with three Christian symbols: the apple, the halo, and the snake.Gauguin's head emerges from simplified yellow angel wings, which contrast with the red background, symbolizing the demonic side of his character. The apples and serpent are references to the garden of Eden, to temptation and to Milton's Paradise Lost (the book was included in his portrait of Meyer de Haan). The sexual allusion of the apples may have been incorporated for more personal reasons - as a symbol of Gauguin's jealousy at Meyer de Haan's love affair with Marie Henry. Once again, Gauguin has freely plundered different cultural traditions in the interests of a strikingly bold, essentially decorative work, combining Christian iconography with the treatment found in Japanese prints

41998-lastsupp.jpg	The painting shows the most dramatic moment of the Last Supper, when Jesus reveals to the disquieted apostles that one of them would betray him. Beside Christ, St John rests his head on the table and sleeps, in keeping with an iconographic tradition popular in Emilia. Meanwhile Peter, to the left of Christ, raises his hands in a gesture of astonishment. In the left foreground, Judas can be seen holding a purse behind his back: this contains thirty coins, the price of his treachery.The painting is one of the masterpieces of Valentin's maturity. His compositional scheme shows classical influence, with the solemn and monumental figure of Christ at the exact centre of the scene and the symmetric composition around him, with the apostles distributed regularly around the table. Such stylistic elements are distant from the convulsed and turbulent compositions Valentin had preferred earlier in his career. In contrast to these, which constitute a large part of Valentin's production, this picture reveals an attachment to the classicising French modes that Poussin and Vouet were developing in these years. Yet Caravaggesque style, an essential component of this painting, is perfectly evident in the realism of the apostles' hands, which Valentin depicts without any sort of idealization. The influence of Caravaggio also shows in the masterful control of light which, through the deft play of chiaroscuro, aptly emphasizes the emotional state of the characters. Likewise, light enlivens the simple but effective still life that seems to spring forth from the white tablecloth

23741-fugger1.jpg	The sitter of this portrait was Ulrich Fugger the Younger (1490-1525). He was born into a family that would soon become one of Europe's greatest mercantile and banking dynasties. His father - Ulrich the Elder - and his uncles Georg and Jacob Fugger together founded a flourishing spice- and textile-trading firm in 1494, which under Jacob's leadership became immensely prosperous by expanding into mining and finance. The young Ulrich traveled widely in Central Europe as a representative of the Fugger firm. His final station in life was the mining centre of Schwaz in Tirol. It was surely in Schwaz in 1525 that Hans Maler painted the present portrait.There is an almost identical other version of the portrait in a private collection which was painted later than the version in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Maler's portraits of Ulrich Fugger represent just one part of his more extensive work for the Fuggers and their close associates in Schwaz, made possible by the increased presence of the Fugger firm in the mining town from 1522 onward. It is conceivable that some were used to decorate the family's new residence and office in Schwaz, the Fuggerhaus, completed about 1525-28

36855-mountain.jpg	"The landscapes by Seghers, of which ""Mountainous Landscape"" is a good example, continue the Mannerist tradition of his teacher Gillis van Coninxloo. There is a similar strong sense of the mysterious and bizarre grandeur of nature. The architecture of these landscapes, the clear logic of their organization and of the measured progression into a deep and ordered space, reveals a debt to contemporary realism; but Seghers was not satisfied with rendering what his eye perceived; he had grander visions of a nature more forbidding, more awe-inspiring - and these he painted, with his Dutch sensitivity to changing light and atmosphere"

18351-1502grec.jpg	There are many versions of The Agony in the Garden painted by El Greco and his workshop, it was one of his most successful inventions. He painted the subject both as a horizontal and as a vertical composition. The version in the Cuenca museum is a fine example of the vertical type. There are other vertical versions in And�jar, Spain, in Budapest and in Buenos Aires. It is noteworthy that the Cuenca version is not only smaller but also considerably more vertical than the other three in this group.

11131-early22.jpg	From 1865 on, the women who toiled at their ironing in the basic, steamy, hothouse rooms of the laundries featured regularly in Salon paintings. The artistic attractiveness of laundry women lay partly in the fact that they were widely perceived as loose-living, since their miserable pay forced many of them into prostitution. Not that this is apparent in Degas's earliest studies, which in 1869 resulted in an unfinished painting, Woman Ironing. It is a delicate, arresting portrait of an unknown woman seen in a fragrantly sketched setting of whites, greys and pale pinks

This visit was cut short by the accusations of May 1795 and arrest, but he returned there, accompanied by a guard, to recuperate after his second and final release in August.

42953-5anticol.jpg	This painting is part of the decoration in the Sala di Anticollegio. This room functioned as the antechamber of honour before being received by the College in the Sala del Collegio.Painted between 1576 and 1580, the picture was reported by Zanetti as hanging in its present place in 1755; it was removed by the French in 1797 and taken to Paris, where it was restored and altered. It represents the mythical rape of Europa by Jupiter in the guise of a bull, as she prepares to mount on the god's back with the help of her maids. The action unfolds towards the right in the manner of a stage sequence, in successive scenes down to the final plunge into the waves of the sea. The composition clearly marks the moment of transition from Renaissance Classicism to seventeenth-century Arcadia. The sumptuous decor and rich colouring were to provide a seminal experience for subsequent Baroque painting. Thus the painting initiates the exaltation of the ruling class through court mythology intended to rekindle the aristocracy's love of pomp and circumstance by allegories with which it could identify itself

22793-madonna.jpg	"This small panel which employs several iconographic models is an especially charming remnant of Cologne Gothic. It depicts the ""humble Madonna"" (Madonna dell' Umilt&#224;) as Mary is sitting on the ground or on a pillow placed on the ground, gently holding an infant in her lap. Their figures are surrounded by adoring angels who offer flowers and fruits to the baby Jesus. To create a backdrop for the scene, two diligent angels stretch out a golden brocade curtain which reminds the viewer of the reigning, victorious Madonna. At the same time, this curtain insures separation from the rest of the world and the intimacy of the holy family. Above, surrounded by light-rays, we can see God the Father and the dove of the Holy Spirit. This intimates the Immaculate Conception; thus the painting includes the depiction of the Holy Trinity. This is the picture of completeness with the Divine Mother as its centre.The image of being enclosed is reinforced by another motif: the low stone wall around Mary, which recalls the ""hortus conclusus"" (enclosed garden), the symbol of Mary's purity and innocence.The spectacular carpet of flowers covering the ground intimates the earthly Garden of Eden, as does the bower of roses. Roses were often connected with the Madonna; such a simile appears in several medieval Latin hymns to the Virgin.The musical child angels in the foreground play an important part in the creation of an idyllic atmosphere. Their instruments - two different sized lutes, a harp and a portative organ - are realistically rendered, and their small hands reveal their musical expertise"

32676-tribune2.jpg	The terracotta relief shown in the picture is a design for the marble relief with the Judgment of Brutus, which was one of the three classical scenes of justice in the Tribunal in the Amsterdam Town Hall.Lucius Junius Brutus, the Roman consul, is the central figure in the story. He was consul in Rome when a group of young Romans conspired against him. The plot was discovered and the conspirators, including Brutus's own sons, were sentenced to death.The sculptor portrayed Brutus in a Roman tunic, while the executioner, as if he were a classical god, is naked. Brutus's gesture indicates to the executioner that the sentence can be carried out. The executioner stands ready to cut off the head of the kneeling youth. In front of the young man lies the head of the previous victim.This cruel scene took place in Rome in the 6th century BC and stood as an example of justice and integrity for the 17th-century judges who pursued their calling in the Amsterdam Tribunal

36462-matthew.jpg	"Savoldo employed dramatic settings with particular attention to luminous night skies. He acquired a reputation for such work with his paintings for the Mint in Milan. Vasari called his works ""nocturnes, with fires, very beautiful"". In the St Matthew and the Angel, a subject appropriate for the Milanese mint insofar as the saint was a tax collector, an angel appears in the darkness to inspire the seated evangelist. Strangely distorting light and shadows play across their drapery and faces, the result of illumination from a small oil lamp placed like a footlight on the table below and in front of them. In the dark recesses at the right two men attend to a seated figure, probably St Matthew in the house of the Queen of Ethopia's eunuch after he had preached and discredited some local magicians. vFlames and sparks from the fireplace throw the three figures into relief, catching St Matthew's hands and face with their light, but consigning the rest of his body to near total darkness. At the far left four small figures wander along a moonlit street. Matthew's peasant's hands, rumpled clothes, contorted neck, and slightly scruffy beard all contribute to the immediacy of the scene, so convincingly real as to be unsettling"

26610-03_4se.jpg	The picture shows the Ignudo at the lower left corner of the Sacrifice of Noah (above the Erythraean Sibyl).The ignudi in the third bay are painted with greater fluency and the modeling is more delicate - with greater attention being paid to the reflections and the subtle effects of light and shade - than those of the first bay. Moreover, their poses are no longer wholly symmetrical. In fact, in the two figures on the left, only the lower part of the body is symmetrical, while the twisting of the bust and the head are expressions of contrapposto. The right arms of both are, however, extended toward the centre in order to hold the ribbon supporting the medallion. On the other hand, the ignudi on the right lean out toward the exterior, and the only difference between them appears to be the position of their arms

34182-1_andrew.jpg	Ribera was trained in Valencia, but in about 1616 he moved to Italy, settling in Naples. A clever draftsman and a master of composition, his numerous paintings are more varied than the legends concerning him might lead one to suppose. In his better work the dominant colors, browns and reds, contrast with cruel lighting, which sometimes appears to do violence to the forms. In Ribera highly refined ecxecution and realistic modeling, particularly the marvelous flesh tints of his saints, are combined with a marked preference for dramatic themes, as may be seen in his St Andrew, in the Prado, or better in the painting of the martyrdom of the same saint, now in Budapest. His Crucifixion, in the collegiate church od Osuna, and his Martyrdom of St Bartholomew (1630) in the Prado, are similar in intention and technique.A preference does not imply total exclusion, and there is evidence that Ribera was also a sumptuous colorist. His style evolved from an early preoccupation with 'tenebrist' techniques, through a period of experiment with a silvery light, to a final stage characterized by warm and golden tones. One of his most beautiful paintings is the Holy Family in the Metropolitam Museum of Art in New York. Ribera also practiced engraving and his influence was considerable, both in Italy, where he lived in Naples when it was ruled by Spanish viceroys, and in Spain. Much of his work was intended for Spanish patrons and was an object of admiration as well as a stimulus to Spanish painters

19800-rake_3.jpg	Hogarth, the son of a schoolmaster, was apprenticed to a silversmith and engraver in 1712, where his interest in copperplate engraving was aroused. He studied at Vanderbank's Academy in St Martin's Lane and at the art school of the court painter Thornhill, whose daughter he married in 1 729, and whose work left him with a life-long ambition to become an historical painter. While he was never to be successful in this field, he soon became well-known as an engraver and painter of pictures, such as the series A Harlot's Progress (1732), A Rake's Progress (1735) and Marriage &#224; la Mode (1742-1744). These became so popular that he had to to take precautions against plagiarism.This is scene III from the series of eight entitled A Rake's Progress.

13637-14ferenc.jpg	"In Ferenczy's ""Woman Painter"", it is apparent how limited the portrayal of nature is around figures. Instead of monumental forests and mountains, he depicts details of home. The setting of ""October"" is the garden of the family's home in Nagyb�nya. The open sunshade and the garden furniture reflect homeliness and cheerfulness. Details selected at a random indicate peacefulness of the country.  The most important element of the picture, a diagonal, is almost unnoticed and it runs from the top left hand corner to the bottom right hand corner. Diagonals normally result a dynamic effect. In this case, however, it only organizes the picture  because its effect is  diminished by horizontals in the background. The line where the fence, the mountain ridge and the sky meet  makes up the diagonal from the highest point of the sunshade, then crosses the hat of the man reading a newspaper, his back and the table cloth. This diagonal is a borderline at the same time. To the left of it, objects of everyday use are depicted, and to the right the autumn landscape in the glimmering sunhine. Gentle sunshine brightens the colours and is especially reflected by white surfaces. Apples on the table display a bright shade of red from among whites, yellows and autumn colours"

35813-s_plums.jpg	"Unlike that of most 17th and 18th century female artists, Rachel Ruysch's work has never sunk into obscurity. She also enjoyed public recognition of her talent during her lifetime: in 1701, three years before painting this particularly charming bouquet, she was the first woman to be admitted to the Confrerie Pictura in The Hague, and in 1708 Johann Wilhelm, the Elector of the Palatinate, appointed her to the position of court painter. The artist's specialities were compositions with fruit, flowers and woodlands. Within this genre she was never a real innovator, but she perfectly assimilated the work of others, equalling them in terms of her painting technique. At least for certain partial aspects of flower painting she sought her own solutions, thereby imposing her own stamp on her creations. During the final decade of the 17th century we can observe the influence in particular of her teacher, Willem van Aelst, and that of Simon Pietersz. Verelst. From the beginning of the 18th century she was inspired by Jan Davidsz. de Heem and Abraham Mignon.The use of a dark background for a bouquet is a tried and tested way of bringing colours and shapes to their own. The fact that very few flowers in the bouquet cross also shows that the painter wished to present the various species in a way that made them clearly recognisable. This almost scientific trait is certainly due, in Ruysch's case, to her father's position as a professor of botany. Typical for this period is the adding of insects and fruit of every kind, here a branch of plums. This fruit with its characteristic matt, bluish tint, which is so difficult to reproduce, appears to have been chosen by painters precisely in order to demonstrate their technical skill. One striking feature of this sumptuous bouquet is the S-shapes in the composition, with which Ruysch seeks a more natural-looking structure in contrast to the strong diagonals found in her earlier work. Rachel Ruysch's personality also speaks to our imagination: although building a professional career was something unusual for a woman at that time, she was simultaneously a ""normal"" woman of her time, as she bore ten children."

17076-paris26.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 364, JH 1352.Influenced by Signac, whom he met around 1887, van Gogh devoted the whole year to a series of experimental variations on the dot or dash brushstroke, the aim of which was not so much optical blending as the structuring of space. The paintings of late 1887, such as Portrait of P�re Tanguy, in which a newly acquired maturity begins to assert itself, retain traces of this experimental Neo-Impressionist practice in the stark contrast between the network of touches of pure colour and the backgrounds against which they are applied

25083-doctors0.jpg	The contribution of the Isaac Master (the young Giotto according to some scholars) to the clerestory frescoes of the upper church was not limited to the two scenes with Isaac from which the painter's name derives. He and his workshop were evidently assigned the decoration of the clerestory and vault zone in the first bay and on the entrance wall. Regrettably, most of the paintings attributed to the Isaac Master and his workshop have been destroyed. The only work that substantially survives is the vault with the church fathers, which until 1997 was fully intact, but it was damaged heavily by the earthquake of September 1997 that caused the east vault cell to collapse. The frescoes of the entrance bay and the vault with the church fathers, which were destroyed at that time and initially thought to be lost forever, have been reassembled from countless fragments.The picture shows the restored state of the vault after the 1997 earthquake

26530-5peter.jpg	According to tradition, Peter was at his own wish crucified upside down, either on the Janiculum hill or in a circus arena between two metae, the pair of turning-posts or conical columns set in the ground at each end of the course. Artists have used both settings, depicting Peter on the cross at the moment of being lifted by soldiers, often surrounded by onlookers, or already raised in position, with a small group of women standing by in allusion to the similar group at Christ's crucifixion. A vision of the apostle's crucifixion appeared to Peter Nolasco.In Michelangelo's composition everything is centred in the fearful event; in triumph over pain and suffering. Solace comes from the spectacle of fortitude, confidence and will-power; the intrepid character of Saint Peter. As in the fresco of St Paul, the main protagonists fits into an ellipse placed in the centre of the cross, extended on four sides by the disposition of the figures. This device lends to the design a clarity and strength which is absent from the restless Damascus scene, because there the fallen Saul appears suspended in mid-air at the lower edge of the picture, and the accompanying figures occupy different levels of space. In the Crucifixion, on the other hand, most of the figures are vertical; only those near the centre give the impression of rotating round the martyr. Their features betray the utmost horror, especially those of the women on the lower right who tremble with terror, and several onlookers seem on the verge of madness.

24893-veronica.jpg	St Veronica's veil with the imprint of Christ's face on it was a favourite theme of medieval mysticism. According to the legend Veronica offered her kerchief to the sweating Christ, who was carrying His cross to Calvary. Profound devotion with a predilection for meditation picked out the figure of the holy woman holding up her kerchief from the animated scene on the way to Calvary.In the present picture, from which the painter derived his name, Veronica herself is beyond the sorrow of the direct experience and though submerged in her thoughts she displays her kerchief with a graceful gesture. The little angels kneeling and squatting as they sing in the foreground regard the pensive face of Christ with an almost cheerful curiosity. The dark face, shown in rigid frontality, with a long straight nose and the severe symmetry of the solid mass of hair and the beard can be traced back to Byzantine icons, which, because they had been copied innumerable times, had been handed down from generation to generation in a relatively unchanged form.In contrast to this face of hieratic frontality, St Veronica's face is somewhat tilted off the central axis, and the angels are animatedly turning their heads into all directions. These three different qualities are characteristic of the whole composition. The figures appear in three diverging dimensions. The tiny heads of the angels markedly intensify the monumentality of the face of Christ. Three planes, clearly separated from one another, are lined up in the picture: that of the angels, of the kerchief and of Veronica s figure. These three planes also reflect the three different levels of reality. The likeness of Christ is the most abstract, having no terrestrial connections whatsoever, not even the folds of the kerchief distort its features. Veronica's body is covered by the kerchief from her shoulders downwards, and as her feet cannot be seen either, she appears to be floating like a vision somewhere above the representation in perspective of the chequered floor. The angels are the most tangible figures, because, on the one hand, their whole bodies are visible and, on the other, because having invaded the bottom frame of the picture they have almost penetrated the viewer's space. The same graduality and an extraordinarily fine sense of rhythm are characteristic of the distribution of colours as well. The dark, almost monochrome face of Christ, out of which only the red of the blood is glowing, is framed by the cream-coloured kerchief. Veronica s pale face is surrounded by a blood-red hooded gown lined with dark green. Finally, the angels are depicted in various cheerful, vivid, light colours

31870-hercul1.jpg	The subject is taken from Apollodorus (2.5:11). On his way back from the Hesperides, Hercules engaged in a wrestling match with the giant Antaeus who was invincible as long as some part of him touched the earth, from which he drew his strength. Hercules held him in the air in a vice-like grip, until he weakened and died. Hercules is depicted with his arms locked round the waist of Antaeus, crushing the giant's body to his own.In pendant with the Hercules and the Hydra this little wood was maybe a decorative panel of furnishing: it had probably to reproduce the subject painted on large canvas in a room of the Florentine Medici palace at the time of Lorenzo the Magnificent. The struggle of Hercules against the giant Antaeus was an iconographical theme proper for Antonio del Pollaiuolo's style, suitable to express dynamic tension of limbs and muscles, as well as the anatomical study of human body.Hercules, the tutelary deity of Florence, the symbol of supreme civil virtues, the typical Florentine hero, is represented here in a fierce struggle which captures not only the movement of the bodies, but also the nervous tension of every muscle and the faces twisted into expressions of fatigue and horror.The subject was particularly popular with Pollaiuolo, given that this is the fourth or fifth version. The artist realized in fact the same subject again for Medici family, as the famous bronzetto now at the National Museum of Bargello in Florence

29180-4resurr.jpg	The Risen Christ, draped only in a bright red cloth, sits on a massive stone sarcophagus, the red seals on the lid of which are unbroken. The body of Christ bears the stigmata of the Crucifixion. His right hand is raised in the gesture of benediction, while in the left He holds a staff surmounted by a cross. In the confined space between the sarcophagus and the enclosing fence four armed soldiers lie in a deep sleep.The Resurrection is one of the panels from a winged altar of considerable dimensions which has been lost without trace. Originally there was a carved central shrine, in which a Crucifixion group was probably represented. When the wings were closed, the altar showed four scenes relating to the Madonna; these (from top left to bottom right) were The Nativity, The Adoration of the Magi, The Descent of the Holy Ghost and The Death of the Virgin. When opened, the inner sides of the wings showed four scenes from the Passion, which flanked the central Crucifixion. Thus Christ on the Mount of Olives (top left), served as a companion-piece to Christ before Pilate (top right), while Christ bearing the Cross (bottom left), was placed opposite The Resurrection.The original location of the altar has never been established. When it was dismantled, the front and rear sides of the wings became separated. On the two lower panels of the closed altar, showing The Descent of the Holy Ghost and The Death of the Virgin, the artist appended his signature : `bitte got f�r hanssen muoltscheren vo richehove burg ze ulm haut dz werk gemacht do ma zalt MCCCXXXVII'. Records show that in 1427 the Swabian artist, who came from Reichenhafen near Leutkirch, became a burgher of Ulm, where he worked not only as a painter but more often as a sculptor and engraver. The strength and solidity of the painted figures and their remarkable realism leave one in no doubt that Multscher combined the skills of both sculptor and painter, even though, in keeping with medieval practice, he may well have made use of a well-staffed workshop.

36405-prati.jpg	"This painting is a fundamental work for the reconstruction of Sassoferrato's production as it is one of his few known portraits and the only one of these to be signed by the painter. Considered one of the highest quality examples of Sassoferrato's oeuvre, the canvas is datable to around 1650.The sitter is Monsignor Ottaviano Prati, a Parmese nobleman who served the papacy as Governor of Benevento and following that, served for a few months as Bishop of Bertinoro. He is shown here at about the age of fifty. It is possible that the introduction between the patron and the artist was made by the Aldobrandini family, for whom Sassoferrato also worked. With its subject shown standing and in three quarter view, this composition is arranged according to the Renaissance canon of portraiture, a style reintroduced in the seventeenth century by Domenichino, Sassoferrato's teacher. The lively rendering of the sitter's intense psychology is realized through the subtle vibrations of light and colour. The brilliant chromatic range, based prevalently on primary colours, underlines the monumentality of the portrait image.An inscription on the sheet of paper that the sitter holds reads ""al..Monsignor... Ottaviano Prati per Giovan Battista Salvi"""

43795-19dance.jpg	Three children have sat down in the open under a tree to make music. A small girl stands in front of them and seems to pause in the act of dancing. In the distance a village church can be seen. The age of the young dancer seems strangely indeterminate; not yet full grown, she nevertheless gives the impression of being remote from the world of children. As in almost all Watteau's pictures, there is a touch of sadness in this scene. A copper engraving of the painting by C. N. Cochin carries a marginal annotation, which begins with the words: 'Iris c'est de bonne heure avoir l'air &#224; la danse . . .'.The strangely statuesque quality of the girl, gazing towards the onlooker, recalls the painter's major work Gilles in the Louvre in Paris. Both pictures must have been painted in the closing years of the artist's life. Three preliminary sketches by Watteau of the group of seated children have survived (Mus�e Cognacq-Jay and A. Str�lin Collection, Paris; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.). At one time the picture was mounted in a circular frame, traces of this being still visible on the canvas.Until 1766 this picture formed part of the famous collection of the Amsterdam merchant Gerrit Braamkamp (1699-1771), from whom it may have been purchased on behalf of Frederick II. On the other hand, it is impossible to identify it with certainty among the Watteau paintings known to be in the Prussian palaces in the eighteenth century. In 1876 it was in the Berlin Palace, later in the New Palace in Potsdam. Even after the collapse of the German Empire, the picture remained in the possession of the Hohenzollerns but was later put in the hands of an art-dealer and was purchased in 1942 for the museum which Adolf Hitler had planned for Linz. It returned to Berlin in 1952 on loan from the German Federal Republic.

18398-1811grec.jpg	"Apostle St Simon is called the Zealot in both the Gospel according to St Luke (6:15) and in Acts (1:13). This name, transcribed from the Greek, is a translation of the Aramaic gan'anai, signifying the apostle's membership of an extremely orthodox Jewish sect. Because he came from Cana, he is also known as the Canaanite or Cananaean. Like the other apostles, after Pentecost Simon vanished from view. Most or less trustworthy legends place his missionary work in Egypt. According to a sixth-century apocryphal tradition, he preached the Gospel in Persia with Jude (Judas Thaddaeus), where they were both martyred. Found guilty of overturning statues of the idols at the end of an argument with pagan priests and magicians, their throats were cut. According to another version, Simon was sawn in two, like the prophet Isaiah.Apostle St Simon in ArtA twelfth-century relief designates Simon by the inscription, Cananaeus (cloister at Moissac). In numerous depictions, Simon is linked with Jude (Luis Borrassa, St Clare Altarpiece, 1414, Museum, Vich, Spain). The most common scenes including both apostles are the toppling of the idols (from which, according to the Golden Legend, emerge two ""naked and black"" Ethiopians) and their martyrdom. Simon was tied to a wheel while two executioners cut through his chest with a bucksaw (capital, Collegiate Church at St Aubin, Gu�rande, twelfth century). In the sixteenth century, D�rer shows Simon carrying a saw (engraving, 1523, Biblioth�que Nationale, Paris).Before the thirteenth century, the Apostle is shown holding a scroll or a book. The saw appears as a specific attribute only later, becoming predominant by the 1400s. In the seventeenth century, however, Simon the Zealot is occasionally shown leafing through a book.Attributes: Book. Saw (since the fifteenth century). Sword or spear (of martyrdom, very rare)"

00631-baptist.jpg	For the Florentine Compagnia dello Scalzo, Andrea del Sarto frescoed the atrium of the brotherhood's chapel. The artist worked on it from 1509 to 1526, with interruptions. A frieze depicts the life of John the Baptist, the patron saint of the brotherhood. Sarto executed the entire decoration in grisaille. This did not just save the brotherhood money, the renunciation of colour also express the rigor and humility of its communal ideal

37259-70mass.jpg	In the bay to the right we find the scene of the Miraculous Mass, an episode that is only very rarely included in Italian fresco cycles. This was the first time it was depicted. The event took place in Albenga and was similar to what happened in Amiens. After having given a beggar his tunic, Martin is about to celebrate mass. During the elevation, the most deeply spiritual moment in the mass, two angels appear and give Martin a very beautiful and precious piece of fabric. There is extraordinary spontaneity and beauty in the deacon's expression of surprise, in his almost fearful gesture: his astonishment is so great that he instinctively reaches out towards his bishop. The scene is a masterful composition of volumes and shapes with the linear elements (the candlesticks and the decoration of the altar-cloth) alternating with the solid structures of the altar and the dais, beneath a barrel-vaulted ceiling

24016-1chapel0.jpg	Mantegna's first important commission from Ludovico Gonzaga was the decoration of the chapel in Castello di San Giorgio, executed in the first half of the 1460s. It is unfortunately impossible to reconstruct the whole of Mantegna's original intentions there with any confidence, although some panels almost certainly traceable to the chapel still survive. They include three paintings in the Uffizi: The Ascension of Christ, The Circumcision and The Adoration of the Magi. Today they are mounted as a triptych in the Uffizi with The Adoration of the Magi in the centre. They were given this format in 1827, but the inconsistencies in both composition and iconography indicate that these are individual works rather than parts of a uniformly planned altarpiece. Nevertheless, they were created for the same chapel.The three Magi symbolize both the three ages of man and also the three continents known at that time, Asia, Europe, and Africa. The adherents of different cultures among the followers of the kings are depicted realistically - they were familiar because of the activities of cosmopolitan Venice, a major trading centre and slave market

09555-corot10.jpg	Besides landscapes, Corot worked in the studio on studies from life. The male friends or young girls who modelled for him varied their poses during the sittings, as Corot made numerous sketches, and then selected an attitude or expression that he could use later in a full composition, thereby blending realism with feeling and allegory. Thus transfigured, his models become archetypes, allegorical figures, and deities.

In its form and composition the narrative cycle borrows from sixteenth-century Venetian painting, which beginning with Veronese had specialised in depictions on ceilings of historical events viewed from extremely low vantage points.The cycle is a collective work by Filippo Gherardi and Giovanni Coli, the architecture painting and framing is by Johann Paul Schor and his workshop

33933-aholyfam.jpg	This painting may be dated to Reni's youthful period in Bologna in the 1590s when he was working under the influence of his teacher, the Flemish painter, Denys Calvaert.The conception and execution of this work clearly show an affinity with Calvaert's small devotional works on copper, combining the colour and detail that Calvaert brought from his Flemish heritage with the mannerist tradition found in Bologna

11306-408delac.jpg	As a rich source for exotic and dramatically violent themes, the novels of Sir Walter Scott were immensely popular with Romantic painters. Delacroix, despite his reservations about their literary merit, repeatedly found inspiration in these writings. This picture, painted in 1846 and exhibited in the Salon of that year, illustrates an episode from Scott's Ivanhoe, in which the beautiful Rebecca is carried off by two Saracen slaves at the command of the Christian knight who has long coveted her. Intense drama is created as much by the contorted poses and compacted space as by the artist's use of vivid color. Contemporary critics, including Baudelaire, praised the work's spontaneity and power

18355-1506grec.jpg	Several versions have been preserved of this representation of St Francis with Brother Rufus. There is an early version in Bergamo, derived from a composition by Titian existing only in woodcut. Another version, likewise early, in the Zuloaga Museum at Zumaya, already shows wide divergences from Titian's composition.

18100-1pisa.jpg	Gozzoli spent the last years of his life in Pisa, where he was commissioned in 1469 to carry out a major cycle of frescoes for the Camposanto comprising 26 pictures from the Old Testament, and on which he was to work for 16 years. The order in which they were created can be reconstructed from the account books where the payments were recorded until 1485 when the final bill for the work was produced. The frescoes are the following: Vintage and Drunkenness of Noah, Building of the Tower of Babel; Adoration of the Magi; Abraham and the Priests of Baal; Departure of Abraham and Lot; Victory of Abraham; Abraham and Hagar; Burning of Sodom; Sacrifice of Isaac; Wedding of Isaac and Rebecca; Birth of Esau and Jacob; Wedding of Jacob; Meeting of Jacob and Esau; Story of Joseph (2 frescoes);  Moses' Youth; Moses and the Tables of the Law; Dance around the Golden Calf; Punishment of Korah; Aaron's Rod; The Serpent of Bronze; Battle of the Jordan; Death of Aaron and Moses; The Fall of Jericho and David and Goliath; Meeting of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.In 1944 a bombing raid, followed by a disastrous fire, destroyed or damaged the greater part of the frescoes. In spite of the restoration carried out after the war, they have remained disfigured and, as they are kept in storage, not on view. Nor can the sight of the sinopie in Pisa's Museo delle Sinopie, made possible by their detachment, do justice to what was the masterpiece, or at least the most demanding work, of Benozzo's whole career.By describing it as an opera terribilissima, Vasari honoured Benozzo's work with the adjective that he chiefly, though not exclusively, used in his Lives for the insuperable art of Michelangelo. And even though he was referring to the scale and importance of the undertaking rather than to the dazzling grandeur of the results, the term is still an expression of the admiration that the not very indulgent biographer, and to an even greater extent Benozzo's contemporaries, had for his most demanding work
