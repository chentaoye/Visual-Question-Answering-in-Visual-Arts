20719-beankin.jpg	"This lavish depiction originates in the custom, at the Feast of the Three Kings (6 January), of proclaiming the person finding a bean hidden in his tart king for the evening and having him select his court from among those present.In the middle, behind the festive board, laden with expensive dinnerware, waffles, pastries and wine, sits enthroned the king of the evening. We easily recognise the old man as Jordaens' father-in-law, the painter Adam van Noort. He raises his glass to his mouth, at which everyone loudly proclaims: ""The king drinks!"". To the right of the festive pig the court musician is enlivening the solemn moment with his bagpipes, and next to him his butler lifts wine jug and glass with a sweeping gesture. To the left the court fool responds by raising his lighted pipe. The boisterous reactions of the other guests show that they have already indulged heavily in food and drink. In the right foreground a mother has to clean her crying child. To the left a bragging man lifts his cap and can into the air, whilst a dog jumps up at the surrounding hullabaloo. The drunkard in the left foreground, in the process of vomiting, grabs giddily at the back of a chair, tipping a set of drinking vessels noisily to the ground.Certain art historians have seen in this depiction of extreme merriment a turning away from such behaviour by a soberly inclined artist who had become a Protestant in later life. This interpretation may well be as unsatisfactory as the earlier reading of it as an ode to pleasure within the warm family circle, a concept so popular that it even founds its way onto biscuit tin lids. The surfeit to which Jordaens' figures are giving themselves over, but which is not really doing them much good, receives a somewhat ambivalent commentary in the cartouche in the top centre: ""In een vry gelachllst goet gast syn"" (where there is a free meal it is good to be a guest). A contradiction appears to exist between the message and the scene confronting us. Here the realisation that one should count oneself lucky not to have to pay the bill leads too far from pleasant excesses. Jordaens' presentation is therefore not free from a certain amount of irony."

14537-judith.jpg	"Furini, a central figure of Florentine seventeenth-century painting and a student of Passignano and of Bilivert, was in Rome in 1619. There he absorbed the foundations of the Caravaggesque style through his exposure to Manfredi. Next he went to Venice, where he developed a complex and individualistic baroque style; precious and hazily atmospheric.The dependence of the figure of Judith on a statue of Giambologna (the Mars now at the Berlin State Museum) has been noted: the same artistic reference appears in other works of the painter. The Judith and Holofernes is identifiable as the same one that Baldinucci described in the Vitelli collection, a painting commissioned directly from Furini by his ""illustrious benefactor"" and which later passed into the Salviati collection. Dating to about 1636, the work belongs to the period of the painter's maturity. The figure of Judith can be connected to another painting of Furini's with a similar subject (Florence, private collection) which belongs to an immediately subsequent moment of the artist's career."

15651-vailetti.jpg	The Bergamasque artist Vittore Ghislandi underwent a long apprenticeship in his two stays in Venice between 1675 and 1701, and combined the training received in Venice from the Baroque artist Sebastiano Bombelli and in Milan from Salomon Adler, still strongly influenced by Rembrandt, in a style of clearly realistic intentions, consonant with the great tradition of Lombard painting. Ghislandi exercised this predilection with incomparable strength in his portraits, of which the one depicting Count Giovanni Battista Vailetti is an excellent example. The nobleman's proud good looks and his serene control over his feelings are rendered with exceptional vividness as he poses in the intimacy of his study. There is a definite Enlightenment flavour in the realistic rendering of appearances in the portrait and in the acute psychological analysis it embodies

20810-entombme.jpg	Juan de Juanes was more adept an imitator of Raphael than his father, Vicente Masip, and succeeded to a greater extent in appropriating the graceful, restrained emotion of the Italian master. In 1562, he was paid for his contribution to an altarpiece comprised of six panels with scenes of the life of St Stephen and three of the life of Christ for the Valencian church of San Estaban (now in the Prado, Madrid). The Burial of St Stephen is derived in part from Raphael; the disposition of the figures and the man holding the hand of the saint are lifted from the Borghese Deposition. More important, Juanes has partly assimilated Raphael's facial types and use of emotive gestures

08204-lastrace.jpg	The American George Catlin addressed himself to documenting Native American peoples in the face of their imminent destruction. He sent the 'Indian Gallery' to Paris in the 1840s after it had toured in America and Britain. Catlin had abandoned a successful career as a portrait painter in Washington to document the lives and culture of Native Americans west of the Mississippi. One of the pictures in the gallery, The Last Race, Mandan 0-Kee-Pa Ceremony shows an innocent style, purged of academicism. But despite Catlin's genuine zeal to preserve the 'monuments of a noble race', he accepted that the Native Americans were 'doomed and must perish', and that their ultimate destiny was to yield their land to white Christian settlers

00867-marco2.jpg	The Museum of San Marco is located in the former monastery of the Dominicans, constructed by Michelozzo in 1436 on a commission from the Medici ruler Cosimo the Elder. Michelozzo here adheres firmly to the Renaissance forms of Brunelleschi, even though his classicism has none of the other's passion for archeological research in it. The smooth, flowing lines of the cloister's arches create effects of light and shade which alternate in the series of vaults. Naturally the religious function and the deliberately spiritual effect of the structure, suggested by the order's Vicar General and perhaps by Fra Angelico himself, qualify these chiaroscuro and plastic impressions. The history of San Marco is inseparably linked to the figures of the painters, Fra Angelico and Fra Bartolommeo, and the friar Girolamo Savonarola.The figure of Angelico dominates in the Convent.  The friar painter lived a long time here and expressed here his delicate and simple soul in the sincere, candid forms of art. But a great part, not only the artistic, but of the religious and civil history of Florence developed here.In the cloisters, in the dormitories, in the cells we find the conventual character well-preserved in the harmonious architectural plan. We also find the memory of San Antonino, who entered here as a friar, and, it is said on the advice of Angelico, came out of it in 1445 archbishop of Florence; and the memory of Savonarola, who came here in 1489, and was later prior of the convent and who from here raised himself against the decadence of habits calling the people to liberty and democratic arrangement; and the memory, above that of Angelico's almost unknown collaborators, of a great friar painter, Fra Bartolommeo

15844-liberati.jpg	Raphael's Liberation of St. Peter in the Stanza d'Eliodoro in the Vatican constitutes a classic prototype and must have made a great impression on the young Luca Giordano from Naples when he studied it in the early 1650s. That the present composition was created with Raphael's version in mind is clear. The monumentality and symmetry of the composition are similar to Raphael's fresco as are the idealized nobility of the main figures and the gleaming rendering of the soldiers' armor. The painting is Roman in concept yet Venetian in style and colour at the same time. Giordano was inspired by Raphael and reformed the old master's monumental masterpiece

06299-seateddr.jpg	Born in Oudenaerde in Belgium, Adriaen Brouwer studied painting in Amsterdam, then Haarlem, where he came into contact with members of local rhetorical chambers, before settling in Antwerp. Admitted as a free master to the painters' guild in 1632, he also became a member of the rhetorical chamber associated with it. He was popular with his Antwerp colleagues who repurchased his freedom - perhaps by acquiring certain of his paintings when he was imprisoned for debt.Adriaen Brouwer specialised in depicting characters on the edge of society spending their time in licentious activities such as card-playing or alcohol and tobacco abuse. This debauched behaviour was looked down on by the members of bourgeois society who saw in it the confirmation of their own moral superiority. During his brief career Brouwer produced only a few dozen works, but revolutionised genre painting with his original synthesis between village scenes with a Bruegelian inspiration and Haarlem genre painting. His great pictorial mastery aroused the admiration of his peers, and painters and collectors like Rubens and Rembrandt owned several of his pictures.Under the influence of early biographers, who attempted to draw parallels between the author's work and his life, experts have sought to see in the background of the Seated Drinkers the wall of Antwerp citadel, then a jail, where the painter was imprisoned. This is, however, unlikely: the artist represented this type of rudimentary landscape several times over, with no link between the subject matter and his time behind bars. On the other hand, the finesse of this finely tempered little masterpiece has been rightly recognised from the outset. Here Brouwer has reached his full maturity. A few delicate red and yellow highlights are enough to enliven a composition largely dominated by subtly gradated browns and greys. If one needed to make a comparison between the painter's life and his work, it would be between the artist's untiring interest for theatre life and the very convincing way in which he succeeds in translating the psychological interplay of the figures.

10079-07altar.jpg	The subject of the triptych is the legendary family of Christ, derived from the idea of Anne's three marriages with Joachim, Cleophas and Salomas. In the central panel Mary is seen with her mother tending the infant Jesus while her husband Joseph sleeps. Mary is said to have had two similarly named stepsisters, whose marriages with Zebedee and with Alphaeus produced the Apostles John the Evangelist and James the Greater (right) and James the Less and Joseph and Simon and Jude (left and centre).There are actual political comments in the painting: Elector Frederick the Wise and his brother, Duke John the Steadfast are shown full-length in the side wings in the roles of husbands of Mary's two stepsisters. The second and third husbands of Anne seen in the gallery are given the features of Emperor Maximilian and one of his advisers at court. The painting suggests the loyalty of the Saxons towards the Imperial court.On his journey to the Netherlands in 1508, Cranach may have seen Quentin Massys's St Anne Altarpiece which Massys was currently working on.

19291-titus.jpg	During his time in Rome Constantin Hansen painted oil studies in the open air to provide variety in between his more complex figure compositions. One of his freest and most original studies is this picture of the Titus Arch near the Forum Romanum. He depicted it from a rather unconventional angle. The arch is not seen from the front, but from the side, thereby dramatically shortening the fa�ade. The picture does not give a representative view of the building, meaning that it was not a travel or tourist picture intended for audiences back in Copenhagen. It is a study done exclusively for the artist's own sake

44797-stillife.jpg	The authorship of this still-life painting remains uncertain. It has been considered a work by Francisco de Zurbar�n. The almost geometrical roundness and sharply delineated contours of the apples are reminiscent of Zurbar�n's treatment of the fruit in some of his still-lifes while the motif of fruit on a reflective silver or pewter plate appears in the paintings of both Zurbar�n and his son Juan. The painting is also close in sensibility to the still lifes of Pedro de Camprob�n. The elegant motif of the tall glass containing a single sprig of orange blossom is reminiscent of the small glass vessels with flowers that appear in the works of Camprob�n. However, a number of stylistic features of the painting suggest that Juan de Zurbar�n may be its author and it perhaps dates the from the early years of his short career, when an admiration for the style of his father prevailed.The appeal of the painting lies in the exquisite simplicity of the artist's presentation of the modest subject matter, a plate of red and gold apples on a silver plate and a single flower in a glass. This is, however, an enhanced vision of the beauty of the natural motifs

40319-208turne.jpg	It was from a German story, by Friedrich Heinrich Karl, Baron de la Motte Fouque, that he took the story of Undine, the sea sprite who, created without a soul, must gain one by marrying a human and bearing his child, but pay the price of assuming all the burdens of humanity. Turner probably knew the story from Hoffmann's opera (1816) or from a ballet recently seen on the London stage. In this picture of 1846, he marries his sprite to Massaniello, who had led a fishermen's revolt in seventeenth-century Naples. As a keen fisherman himself, and angry about recent criticism of his work, he doubtless identified with the rebellious Italian. In this union of fact and fantasy, history and myth, body and soul, and its contrasted protagonists, realized in shimmering colours, he seems to comment on his own union with elemental forces of sea, sky and wave.

36835-ploughin.jpg	In the 1880s, Lombardy began to play an active part in Italian art. The movement that originated there declared its loyalty to the great Italian tradition, and was particularly interested in atmospherics of light, colour, and texture. In the 1890s, such work came into its own with divisionist or pointillist paintings.From 1886 on, Segantini, an Italian divisionist, developed his own technique for splitting colours, using separate brush-strokes for complementary colour values. His art concentrated on the light in the mountains, which provided him with a preferred subject which he tended to interpret in strongly Symbolist ways

41381-08scene1.jpg	"The ""Babylonian exile"" of the popes (1309-1376) transformed the previously somewhat insignificant city of Avignon into the most magnificent residence in Europe. A huge papal palace was built which was decorated by artists from Italy and specifically Siena, with none less than Simone Martini at their head. The surviving murals convey a unique impression of a court of the day The preference for motifs taken from the animal and plant kingdoms reaches its high point in the pope's favourite relaxation room, the Deer Room, a testament to the nobility's passion for hunting. It is the oldest representation of Nature on such a grand scale, of such ambition, and with such fidelity to life.The chief surviving paintings by this workshop are the frescos of various hunting scenes which decorate the Deer Room in the Tour de la Garde-Robe, built in 1342/43 under Pope Clement VI, in the Papal Palace in Avignon. The style of the paintings suggests that they were designed by Italians, while their execution was probably entrusted to French assistants. The master in charge may possibly be identical with Matteo di Giovanetto da Viterbo, who was the current court painter to the Pope.Hunting with falcons, ferrets and decoy birds, and scenes of bathing and harvesting, are interwoven with individual trees and plants in a rich tapestry extending across all four walls. The only wall uninterrupted by doors or windows is dominated by a large pool rendered in a perspective fashion, around which various different means of fishing are portrayed. As in the case of the birds and plants, we are shown a wealth of different species of fish; there is even a dolphin"

07470-092lute.jpg	This painting, mentioned in Del Monte's inventory, shows a single lutanist singing a love song; and a related 'carafe with flowers' is also listed in the catalogue of the Del Monte sale. From the seventeenth century there have been uncertainties about the gender of the singer. Baglione and the Del Monte inventory call him a boy; Bellori, who knew only a copy, calls him a girl. There are reasons for this confusion. One is the Renaissance fascination with androgyny - the singer is not much older than Shakespeare's Rosalind, who renamed herself Ganymede, and Viola, who renamed herself Cesario - and another is the Italian fashion for castrati. The lutanist, with parted lips, sings of love from the madrigal Voi sapete ch ['io v'amo] (you know that [I love you]) by the Flemish composer Arcadelt. In front of him are a violin and bow which invite the spectator to take part in a duet with him; the fruit and the vegetables, and indeed the music itself, imply the harmony that should exist between lovers.Among the early works this painting must count as a virtuoso performance. The glass carafe and its flowers are painted with assured mastery, and Caravaggio is also aware of the problems of perspective that lutes and violins could cause; and he spotlights the the solo player and his instruments so as to make them the main focus of attention, the carafe of flowers so that they are a secondary focus. One of his most talented followers, Orazio Gentileschi, was to paint a girl lutanist with a more beguiling sense of poetry, but without the sense of immediacy that was the hallmark of his master's craft.

38562-flautist.jpg	In the 1630s the young Teniers was strongly influenced by Adriaen Brouwer, who reintroduced into Flemish painting the practice of depicting common people, begun by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

42091-09lorenz.jpg	Giorgio Vasari, one of the most famous interpreters of the second period of Mannerism, experimented with just about all genres, from portraits to religious and mythological themes. This painting of Lorenzo the Magnificent is distinguished by its intensely plastic colour, although the chiaroscuro is understated. The form is rendered with decision, almost with hardness, a quality discernible in the hands with their protruding veins and rather woody knuckles. Unlike Bronzino, who always placed his characters in an abstract fixity, Vasari seeks to introduce in his Lorenzo the idea of movement, positioning the figure obliquely and breaking the outlines, as can be seen in the ermine trimmings of the tunic

07140-flowers2.jpg	In the pair of flower pieces, now in the Prado, the bouquets are arranged in two identical gilt vases resting on a long wooden table in an unspecified interior space. Unlike the stone ledges and rocky outcrops favoured by contemporary flower painters in Madrid, the plain wooden tabletop, which had also been used in the still-life paintings of Francisco de Zurbar�n, was a favourite means of support in the flower pieces of Camprob�n. Pink, white and red roses predominate in the centre of the compositions and are accompanied by irises, lilies and carnations, with generous amounts of foliage punctuating the spaces between the blooms. Flowers spill out around the vases and hang down almost to meet the loose blooms resting on the tabletop, that include a branch of lilies and a sprig of orange blossom. The finesse and attention to detail with which Camprob�n depicted flowers is epitomised by the few loose leaves and fallen petals that he carefully depicted on the wooden table, motifs that also suggest that the flowers were in the fullness of their bloom.

25956-noahark1.jpg	When Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau (1559-1617), the founder of Baroque Salzburg, took office as prince-archbishop in 1587, the contemporary local art scene was lacking in eminent personalities and high-quality works of art. In order to demonstrate appropriately the splendour of his court, Wolf Dietrich commissioned artists from abroad. Immediately after Wolf Dietrich had taken office, he commissioned the painter Kaspar Memberger the Elder from Constance to paint a five-part Noah's Ark Cycle.With loving attention to faithful detail, Memberger's Noah cycle of five paintings gives a lively rendering of the most important events in the biblical story (Gen 6&#151;9): the building of the ark, the animals entering the ark, the flood, the animals leaving the ark and Noah's sacrifice of thanksgiving. All the paintings are dated and signed and bear the arms of both the Land Salzburg and of Wolf Dietrich. They are similar in their formal composition: against the partial view of a mountain landscape, the protagonists engage in their various activities in the foreground.The brilliant composition, minute execution and balanced use of colour prove the artist's Dutch-Italian training. He took over individual elements of the narrative from the depiction of the flood by Jacopo Bassano, without, however, copying the work of this eminent representative of late Renaissance painting in Venice. Memberger translated these elements into his own native idiom, differing from Bassano in his depiction of richly dressed people rather than humble beings, and his use of a visual vocabulary appropriate to the lofty tone of the court

14956-tahiti03.jpg	It was only at a relatively late stage in this work's development that Gauguin transformed it from a simple still-life of Tahitian fruit to a genre scene, by including the heads of the three children, together with a view out of a doorway in the background. The configuration of the objects, the use of the large open bowl, together with the white cloth and the knife, is remarkably similar to the objects in the still-life by C�zanne that Gauguin owned. Although he did not have the work with him in Tahiti, he had copied it in the background of Portrait of a Woman with Still-Life by C�zanne the previous year, and a memory of the French work clearly lingered in this painting

33475-07mythom.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 471.Among the mythological subjects, the Abduction of Ganymede and the Dana&#235; (1636, The Hermitage, St. Petersburg) are outstanding examples of Rembrandt's sense of high-pitched drama and expressive chiaroscuro. Both these pictures, done on a monumental scale, are of extreme originality and uncompromising realism.Ganymede was a shepherd, the son of Tros, a legendary king of Troy. His outstanding beauty caused Jupiter to fall in love with him. According to Ovid (Met. 10: 152-161) the god, having transformed himself into an eagle, carried the youth off to Olympus where he made him his cup-bearer. The myth, which is given in a slightly different version by Homer, found favour in ancient Greece because it appeared to provide religious sanction for homosexual love. The representation in Renaissance and later art shows Ganymede caught in the embrace of, or on the back of, the eagle which bears him upwards, its wings either spread in flight or enfolding the youth, its claws holding his limbs

17105-2maries5.jpg	Catalogue numbers: F 413, JH 1460.In June 1888 van Gogh travelled by coach across the Camargue, which reminded him of Holland, to the seaside resort of Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer on the Mediterranean. The village was famous for its fortified cathedral, built like a ship, the curious design of the thatched roofs of its cottages, and its fishing fleet. Van Gogh recorded all of these. But the novel opportunities of the place were the sea and the colourful boats. In the years 1881-83 van Gogh had often visited Scheveningen, a fishing village and holiday resort on the North Sea, a few miles from The Hague. There he drew the great fishing smacks drawn up on the beach, in the manner of Hague School painters such as Henrik Mesdag and Anton Mauve. Van Gogh's excursus into marine painting in June 1888 recalls their pictures and his own early essays in this genre. In a letter about this trip to the seaside he explicitly compares Les Saintes-Maries with Dutch seascape; it was different only in the greater brilliance of its colours.Fishing Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Maries is a reworking in paint of a sketch (F 1434) done on the spot. This painting is one of the painter's most accomplished attempts to establish a harmony of motif and colour.The motif of small boats drawn up on the beach also occurs in the work of Monet in the 1880s

24587-lotdaugh.jpg	The history of Lot is taken from Genesis (19. 1-38). When the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were about to be destroyed at God's order, angels came and warned Lot to flee with his family. Despite being warned not to, his wife looked back at the burning city of Sodom and was turned into a pillar of salt. Lot and his daughters then took refuge in a cave. Afraid of finding themselves alone on earth and without descendants, Lot's daughters decided to get their father drunk and to seduce him. This latter episode forms the main theme of the painting.At the centre of the composition, the elder sister, half naked, is seated on the knees of the old man Lot. Alongside them, the younger sister gracefully proffers a cup of wine. To the left, Sodom is in flames, whilst the angels are helping Lot and his family to escape; to the right, Gomorrah also is in flames, and facing us, a little city has escaped the disaster. This is probably Zoar, where the family had first taken refuge.Old Testament subjects, until then considered essentially as prefigurations of the New Testament, enjoyed an unprecedented success in the 16th century, in particular as the Reformation encouraged the direct reading of the Bible. In the moral literature of the time, the story of Lot and his daughters served primarily to illustrate the pernicious power of women and the disastrous consequences of drunkenness (according to the Bible, Lot was unaware of anything). The subject matter also furnished an example of unequally aged couples, a fashionable theme at the time. In the picture, the incestuous act is symbolised by the lizard, an impure animal, in the lower left-hand corner. Similarly, the fruit that the younger sister is carrying in her laps evokes desire. The slim, well-figured shapes of the young women, their milky-coloured skins and their languid gestures give off, however, a latent eroticism which is not unambiguous.The work was undoubtedly intended for a private residence. Here Jan Massys reaches the peak of his art. The elegance of the poses and the pronounced taste for sophisticated jewellery and hairdresses reveal the influence of the Fontainebleau school where the artist possibly lived, after being banished from Antwerp (1544-55) under suspicion of sympathising with the Reform movement. The painter was to handle the theme two other times, in particular in paintings conserved at Vienna (dated 1563) and at Cognac

20296-x_lady.jpg	The Lady of Shalott depicts a scene from Alfred Lord Tennyson's 1832 poem of the same title, in which the poet describes the plight of a young woman isolated under an undisclosed curse in a tower near King Arthur's Camelot. According to legend, the Lady of Shalott was forbidden to look directly at reality or the outside world; instead she was doomed to view the world through a mirror, and weave what she saw into tapestry. One day the Lady saw Sir Lancelot passing on his way in the reflection of the mirror, and dared to look out at Camelot, bringing about a curse.

20358-04ingres.jpg	"Ossian purports to be a translation of an epic cycle of Scottish poems from the early dark ages. Ossian, a blind bard, sings of the life and battles of Fingal, a Scotch warrior. Ossian caused a sensation when it was published on the cusp of the era of revolutions, and had a massive cultural impact during the 18th and 19th centuries. Napoleon carried a copy into battle; Goethe translated parts of it; the city of Selma, Alabama was named after the home of Fingal, and one of Ingres' most romantic and moody paintings, the Dream of Ossian was based on it. The originator of the ""unearthed, old Irish fragments"" Fingal and Temora, published in 1762 and 1763, was a Scot, James Macpherson (1736-1796). Ten years after Macpherson's death it was discovered that the poems were forgeries, written by Macpherson himself from fragments of sagas.In 1812 Ingres was commissioned to paint the subject of Ossian for the ceiling of one of the rooms used by Napoleon in the Quirinal Palace in Rome. Three years after Napoleon left, the Pope gave the painting back to the artist, understandably, for the heathen visions were hardly suitable for the Catholic ambience.Ingres handled the theme with monumental simplicity. The dream figures are like transparent alabaster sculptures, they look exhausted, lying almost lifeless, as if they themselves are dreaming the dream. The work has a timeless, dreamlike quality."

00179-cardioti.jpg	"In the years that preceded the Turkish conquest of Constantinople and the ultimate fall of the Byzantine Empire, the Byzantine state had been restricted to the areas around Thrace and the Morea. The difficult circumstances and the insecurity that reigned led the artists of the Capital to seek safer places and new markets. Crete, an island which had been under Venetian domination since 1210, and which was flourishing economically, was one such place. Archival sources mention at least six painters from Constantinople who lived and worked at Chandax (the medieval name for the present-day city of Herakleion in Crete) at the beginning of the 15th century; among them were John Apokaukos and Nicholas Philanthropenos. The wave of ""artistic migration"" which went on even after the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453), led to the spread of the art of the Capital to the island and was a contributing factor in the creation of a particular school of painting, known as the ""Cretan School"", which was to dominate the art scene of the post-Byzantine years.Among the artists who lived and worked at Chandax during this period, worth mentioning is the painter Angelos. More than 15 icons found today on Crete, Naxos, Patmos, Zakynthos, and in museums and private collections, bear his signature - ""cheir Angelou"" (by the hand of Angelos) - or are attributed to him on the basis of their stylistic features. The great number of icons leads us to suppose that Angelos must have had an important workshop in Chandax. Additional information on the painter is provided by the Venetian archives. In them there is a will, dated 1436, signed by one Angelos Akotantos, who has been identified with the painter whose name appears on the icons"

The insurgents are attacking his castle; all is lost; stretched out on a sumptuous bed at the summit of an immense pyre, Sardanapalus orders eunuchs and palace officers to cut the throats of his women, his pages, and even his favourite dogs and horses; none of the objects that have served his pleasure are to survive him.

23515-studiolo.jpg	The Studiolo is a tiny chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori (Palazzo Vecchio), accessible by a hidden spiral staircase. It was dedicated to the geological, mineralogical and alchemical interest of Francesco I de' Medici, son and successor of Cosimo I. Its walls are lined with two tiers of oil paintings on slate or panel that act as doors for cupboards containing Francesco's scientific books, specimens, and instruments.Girolamo Macchietti's contribution to the decoration of the Studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio included the Baths at Pozzuoli. In the Studiolo, he was assigned a subject from daily life, to which his only possible addition appears to be the architectural setting, a severe Tuscan order. One can hardly expect that these hot-spring baths, not far from Naples, were set in architecture of such grandeur, and most likely Macchietti had never seen them. He could, however, have studied and sketched in the Florentine public bath, as did Leonardo and Michelangelo, and the resemblances between the youth reclining on the steps and the seated figure having his leg toweled and their counterparts in Michelangelo's Battle of Cascina) are due not to imitation but to the fact that such poses could be seen daily in any public bath

14479-409fried.jpg	For Friedrich, the liberation of his country presaged a period of happy stability, in which he was elected to the Dresden Academy in 1816 and married two years later. The removal of the stimulus of patriotic resistance rather diminished Friedrich's symbolic rigour. He developed a broader handling of paint, and made a number of studies of clouds and natural phenomena. The change of interpretation and technique can be clearly seen in this painting.With his friend Kersting he had made a tour of the mountainous area near Dresden known as 'Saxon Switzerland', in the summer of 1810. Morning in the Riesengebirge, painted shortly afterwards, is another exposition of his theme of the cross on a peak. In this later picture of the early 1830s, Friedrich recollected his mountain tour in terms of pure landscape, with only a shepherd to inhabit it; the zones of earth and heaven are harmonized by the melding vapour of morning mist

16904-adorati.jpg	Hugo van der Goes painted this work in the closing years of his life, presumably a decade after the Monforte Altarpiece, after he had retired in 1478 into a monastery near Brussels as a lay-brother. The peculiar flatness of the faces and the contrived nature of the whole composition are symptomatic of his later period, in which transitory motifs also become prominent. Although this panel may lack the cohesion of the Monforte Altarpiece, one can still detect in it - particularly in the undignified intrusion of the shepherds - a bold and final attempt by a great artist, who was close to death, to break with accepted tradition in painting and strike out along a new path.The Virgin and Joseph are kneeling - almost symmetrically placed - on either side of the crib which, viewed end-on, adds depth to the scene. Angels are crowding round behind the crib in order to be near the Child. Through an opening in the wall in the right background one has a glimpse of the shepherds in the fields, receiving the glad news. On the left side of the picture, two of them rush in, baring their heads as they enter. The entire scene is revealed to the observer by two prophets in the foreground, who draw the curtains back and create the illusion of 'unveiling' it.The unusually wide yet shallow format of the picture has given rise to the suggestion that it may have been originally designed as a predella. But such an assumption would presuppose an altar of enormous dimensions, the existence of which could not have remained completely unknown. Besides, there is no evidence of predellas in Netherlandish painting, so for the time being the artist's purpose must remain a matter of conjecture.In his Adoration of the Shepherds the painter created something that is far removed from his earlier work, the Monforte Altarpiece. There the composure and dignity of the kings and the natural simplicity of their bearing contrast sharply with the commotion and crowding of the later work, which gives the impression of being somewhat contrived. There is no doubt that the format prescribed by the patron presented the painter with problems of form which were not easy to solve

19447-stillobs.jpg	In this diagonal arrangement the precious nautilus cup dominates the composition. De Heem rendered the mother-of-pearl gleam of the exotic nautilus shell with remarkable precision. A long, dried-out lemon peel has been laid over the shell, linking the nautilus cup with the silver beaker in front of it, in whose engraved silver surface the peel is reflected. This beaker, with its simple decoration, forms in its turn the background for another precious object: the glass-holder, in which a 'berkemeyer' (a glass with a thick, hollow stem and a wide, conical bowl) has been clamped.The splendour of this still-life lies not only in its perfect arrangement within the diagonal composition, but also in the painstakingly chosen gradations of colour which run along the same diagonal. The yellow of the lemon peel is followed by the softer yellow of the glass-holder and the orange of the peach; the red lobster closes off the composition

04476-womanveg.jpg	Like landscape and genre paintings, the still life also achieved a high degree of independence at an early date, through the pioneering work of Pieter Aertsen and his nephew and pupil Joachim Beuckelaer. These masters also played a significant part in the development of the genre scene. After a number of tentative attempts, fully-fledged genre paintings were first produced by Quentin Massys, followed by Jan Sanders van Hemessen and Marinus van Reymerswaele. But it was Aertsen and Beuckelaer who popularised the genre by concentrating on market and fair scenes. In the Woman Selling Vegetables, Beuckelaer combined still-life elements with figures, achieving a powerful, decorative effect by the introduction of strong local colours

04214-breton1.jpg	Having adopted a technique inspired by Neo-Impressionis, �mile Bernard then laid the foundations of Cloisonnism, a principle to which in the space of a few months he went on to give very varied versions, ranging from a geometrical simplification that anticipated Art Nouveau to a kind of medievalism with mystic overtones.In this painting the gently undulating lines that snake across the picture disregard the outlines of the figures and, starting in the hems of the traditional skirts, intertwine.

15597-11pala3.jpg	Vasari wrote with admiration about the high altar of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Ghirlandaio's last work, which was finished by his pupils. Until 1804 it stood in its original place, and then was dismembered and scattered in various collections all over Europe. The central piece depicting the Madonna and saints in a ring of cherubs, together with the wings portraying St Catherine and St Lawrence, is now in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, the Resurrection, which was, according to Vasari, originally on the back of the central panel and was completed by Ghirlandaio's brothers Benedetto and Davidde, found its way from Florence to the Berlin-Dahlem Museum. The wings representing St Vincent and St Anthony were also in the Berlin-Dahlem Museum, but they were destroyed in 1945, during the war.Today we cannot exactly reconstruct the original form of the altar. Traditionally all the panels in Berlin are regarded as having belonged to the back of the altar, but while Vasari mentions six wings describing the front of altarpiece, he does not mention such on the back.Thus the supposition that the saints in Munich and Berlin, together with the St Stephen in Budapest and with St Peter the Martyr, earlier in a private collection in Paris, all decorated the front of the altar seems justified.The painting was executed by Ghirlandaio and his workshop

36841-floral_w.jpg	Religious flower still-lifes are a special category, first developed by the Fleming Daniel Seghers, a pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder. While Dutch paintings of flowers, particularly tulips, clearly showed a tendency towards secularization (with noticeable emphasis on the economic and aesthetic value of flowers rather than their religious significance), Seghers tried to recover their spiritual symbolism, in accordance with the counter-reformational aims of the Jesuit order. They are set against dark backgrounds of cartouches or niches in shades of brown, with floral wreaths in glowing colours climbing up like garlands. Instead of being illuminated from outside, the wreaths seem to have a luminosity of their own.Seghers generally had the Madonna painted in relief by some artist colleague (in this case by Cornelis Schut and J. van Thielen) before surrounding it with flowers and/or fruit. Thus his pictorial concept served to emphasize its character as a religious object, without any real presence of Mary or Jesus. They were devotional pictures, intended to confirm the practice of church worship, communicated through the illusionist reproduction of the religious object itself. It was not the artist's intention to produce a true-to-life fictitious reality that would enable the believer or viewer to bypass the Church and to enter into devout communication

31983-1depos.jpg	The Deposition can perhaps justly be described as the artist's masterpiece. The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and drapes that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background. This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Piet&#224; or Lamentation over the Dead Christ. The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap. The Virgin, visibly distraught, and perhaps on the point of fainting, still glazes longingly towards her Son, and gestures with her right arm in the same direction. In the centre of the painting, the moment of the separation is underlined by the subtle contact of Mary's legs with those of Christ, now freed from his Mother's last pathetic embrace. The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Piet&#224; (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin. Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father. The general direction of the movement is, in fact, a rising one, and is created by the ethereal quality of the weightless figures, and their slow, almost dance-like rhythm. The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens. The transparent shadows do not annul the colours, but actually become them, in the flesh tones invested with subtle shades of pink and green.The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself. Staring at something beyond the confines of the painting and looking as though he were about to leave the pictorial space, he presents us with this complex and refined decoration of colours, forms

35785-torrent.jpg	Drawing on the works of the Barbizon School, Russ sought to depict simple, everyday motifs together with the atmosphere characteristic of the time of year or day.

41999-martyrdo.jpg	St Lawrence was a Christian martyr of Spanish birth who died in Rome in 258, one of the most venerated saints since the 4th century. He was ordained deacon by Pope Sixtus II and met his death shortly after the pope's own martyrdom. Tradition has it that the pope, when arrested, instructed Lawrence to give away to the poor the church's treasures, consisting of precious vessels and money, for which, as deacon, he was responsible. No sooner had he done so than Lawrence was ordered by the Roman prefect to surrender them to him, whereupon Lawrence, indicating the poor and sick around him, said, 'Here are the treasures of the Church'. For this he was condemned to be roasted on a gridiron, a torture he underwent with equanimity, merely observing, 'See, I am done enough on one side, now turn me over and cook the other'.Valentin de Buologne was a French Caravaggesque painter who came so close to the master that he was perfectly in place among his Italian contemporaries, French characteristics being confined to certain details

15781-trompe.jpg	In 17th-century Flemish and Dutch paintings still-lifes, kitchen scenes and even flower pieces often had a moral undertone in that they encouraged the viewer to reflect on the notion of transience. In some cases, they are out-and-out vanitas paintings, in which each object is intended as a reference to the vanity and transience of earthly existence, with its pleasures and concerns. The 'vanitas vanitatum' - vanity of vanities - idea provides the key to several remarkable still-lifes by Cornelis Norbert Gijsbrechts. This artist worked most notably for the Danish court, and specialized in trompe-l'oeil or illusionistic paintings. His vanitas still-lifes contain a collection of objects symbolizing earthly pursuits and death. The fact that the painting itself is an illusion of reality further emphasizes the work's deeper meaning - the futility of earthly existence

43245-forest1.jpg	"This is a fine example of a forest landscape by Vinckboons. He produced similar compositions in other forest landscapes in the first decade of the seventeenth century. These landscapes respond strongly to forest scenes by Gillis van Coninxloo, who worked in Amsterdam from 1595 until his death.In the present painting the story of Jairus's daughter and the woman who touches Jesus's garment is illustrated.

33382-05newtes.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 423.This painting is a typical small-scale work of Rembrandt's Leiden period. The fact that the painting was not given a more specific title does not mean that Rembrandt had no specific subject in mind. Assuming that he intended the painting to be more than merely a genre scene, the most likely explanation is that it represents St Peter and St Paul in conversation. There were several earlier representations of this theme in art which show the two apostles as bearded scholars seated together, with one expounding a passage in a sacred book which the other holds on his knee.Rembrandt omits the attributes by which the two apostles were traditionally identified, he relies only on their physical characteristics, as established by artistic precedent, and on what they are seen to be doing, that is earnestly discussing a text which the one (St Peter) is explaining to the other

The landscape background is of the highest quality, with recognizable view of Brescia.The bright figure of the ascending Christ is surrounded by clouds that are lit up by the red rays of the early morning sun. The light in the upper part of the painting forms a vivid contrast to the darkness of the tomb, where the only flashes of light are reflections from the guards' armour. This dramatic effect of the light supports the theological message of the Resurrection.Titian openly vies with sculpture in the figure of Christ, taking inspiration from the recently discovered Hellenistic statue of Laocoon

29872-zelle.jpg	"Thanks to the attractive Latin inscription around the edge of the tapestry ornamenting the back of the painting, we know the name and profession of the person portrayed. It is Joris van Zelle, born in 1491 at Leuven where he studied medicine. As early as 1522 he was appointed physician of the city of Brussels, practising at St John's Hospital until 1561. He was a neighbour and probably a friend of Bernard van Orley. Both lived at the Place Saint-G�ry, the first at the corner of the Rue de la Digue, the second opposite the church entrance, and both belonged to the De Corenbloem rhetoric chamber. Van Zelle died in 1567 and was buried in the Church of St Gudule, next to his wife, Barbara Spapen. The archives describe him as a 'medicus celeberrimus"".The portrait renders homage as much to the humanist as to the bibliophile, surrounded by books that are remarkable for their precious bindings. The 32 works from his library, which are conserved to this day in Augsburg, most of them medical treatises, are elegantly and expensively bound. Wearing a felt hat and a fur-lined coat, the young 28-year old practitioner is taking notes, with his ink-well and quill-case hanging behind him. The significance of the joined hands and the ANVTEFQS monogram decorating the tapestry remain unclarified until this day. Do they allude to the understanding between the artist and his model? This has been suggested, but the mystery remains. Psychological depth is not the primary quality of this portrait.We remain surprised by the physician's slightly lifeless face. The artist carefully and realistically renders the strong-boned nose and firmly-drawn mouth, but fails to capture the feelings, intelligence or erudition of his subject. On the other hand, Van Orley renders almost palpable the warm, limited space surrounding the physician and reflects so well the humanist atmosphere that one feels that one has been admitted into Dr Van Zelle's wainscoted cabinet, as his painter friend probably was. The lively interaction of warm and delicately-shaded reds, greens and browns, the careful painting of the materials, with the viewer immediately able to sense the differences in texture, and the tight framing, all strengthen the sense of intimacy between the sitter and the viewer."

03528-chessboa.jpg	In this picture the archaic arrangement of objects seems rather meagre compared with Dutch still-lifes at that time. Baugin's paintings are dominated by aesthetic elements that reflect a strict Calvinist morality. The symbolic props have been placed very economically: a dark mirror represents sight, a bunch of carnations in a vase - smell, bread and wine - taste, a chessboard in a closed box - touch, and finally the vermilion mandolin - hearing. These are not far from a game of cards (with a Jack of Spades on top) and a tied-up purse. Similar to 'Merry Society' type of paintings, music is regarded as morally corrupt and in opposition to the eucharistic symbols of bread and wine.

16919-calvar.jpg	Although his working life was very short - a mere fourteen years - it was long enough for Hugo van der Goes to establish himself as a major innovator with a powerful creative imagination. There are fifteen altarpieces and paintings by his hand that are known today. Amongst them is the Calvary Triptych, long attributed to Justus of Ghent (Joos van Wassenhove). Most experts now agree that it must be the work of Van der Goes.The central panel of the triptych depicts Christ nailed to a tall cross, with the two thieves to either side of him, tied to their gibbets. They are surrounded by a crowd of figures and horsemen, and the city of Jerusalem is visible in the background. This panel is an impressive work of its own right, but the two panels to either side, which draw their subjects from the book of Exodus, are in many ways even finer.In the left wing, we see Moses beside a great rock that marks the limits of the foreground area. He is plunging a branch into the bitter waters of Marah to sweeten them, so that the Israelites could slake their thirst. Mothers are giving their children to drink, an old man holds out a bowl to his grandson, and another man is sipping the precious liquid from his cupped hand.The right wing depicts the episode of the brazen serpent. The people of Israel are marching through a steep-sided valley. Moses has climbed up onto a rocky promontory above them, his stick in one hand. There he complains to Jehovah that the people will not obey him any more, whereupon Jehovah turns his stick into a snake before the eyes of the astonished crowd. The people of Israel, saved by Moses, are used here to prefigure the destiny of the Christian Church, whose people have been saved by Christ.In the background, the clouds drifting across the sky link the vast landscape into one continuous sweep stretching across all three panels. Shadows are suggested by areas of saturated colour and by the use of cross-hatching. Van der Goes's drawing is precise, taut and incisive. His palette is bright and vibrant, giving a strong sense of real open-air light. Along with more forthright tones, he delights in blending together delicate colours such as moss green and olive green, wine red, different gradations of blue, and soft pink

03146-pidgeon.jpg	"""What note is a gentleman supposed to write when he is sending a pair of pigeons to a young lady? ... 'Allow me to take the liberty of sending you, dear lady, a pair of doves as a present  ... When watching them play, think of your faithful admirer."" This is what the Home Secretary of Pest-Buda in the year 1832 suggested to the gentlemen.The picture shows the home of a daughter of a good family. Her charming face and carriage are typical of the ideals of the last century: she is the symbol of innocence and protection. The pigeon makes the impression of innocence stronger and lets us know that secret emotions will soon wing away out of  the cage of the bierdermeier room: a wing of the pigeon indicates that the bird is ready to fly.The picture is a fascinating one and the way it is  painted indicates virtuosity. Whites are rivalling one another in making the portrayal lifelike: the taffeta-like stiff silk dress is glistening as if metal, the soft grey of the feathers makes the white of the wing softer, but it is highlighted by the colour of  the arms and the shoulders. The white of the window-post is radiating hard,  to which  the  soft brown of  the sunshone table and the fresh red of the rose answer. This picture is a portrait, but it is a perfect genre picture of the age, too .."

43589-7sophoni.jpg	The subject of this history painting is drawn from Livy's Historia ab urbe condita. Sophonisba was the daughter of a Carthaginian general at the time of the second Punic war. She married a prince of neighbouring Numidia, allied to Rome, and succeeded in alienating him from his Roman masters. But he was captured by another Numidian leader Masinissa, who in turn fell in love with Sophonisba, and likewise married her. To prevent the loss of a second ally from the same cause the Roman general Scipio demanded that she be surrendered and sent captive to Rome. Her husband, not daring to defy Scipio, sent her a cup of poison which she drank.The painting shows this dramatic last moment in the life of the young woman. Ermine robe and radiant crown denote her queenly rank. An elderly maid behind her, conscious of impending tragedy, gazes upward despairingly. In the background is a landscape with a dramatically illuminated evening sky. The painting was done in Rome, where Vouet had been living since 1613. The drama of the situation finds emphatic expression not only in the expressive eye-contact and the swirling detail of the figures, but also in the vigorous contrasts of lighting which put the heroine at the centre of the action

32500-sebastia.jpg	"This altarpiece once decorated an altar of the church of Santa Maria presso San Celso in Milan. It was confiscated by the French authorities and then exhibited in the Louvre, before being sent to Brussels.The Golden Legend recounts how Sebastian, originating from Milan, was appointed commander of the Praetorian Guard by Emperor Diocletian, who was unaware of his Christian faith. His open proselytism led to his being arrested and sentenced to be shot to death with arrows. Surviving this first torture, he was nursed by Irene. In the 17th century, artists at times replaced Irene by angels, preferring to the human and familiar side of this martyrdom scene a divine solemnity more in keeping with the criteria of the Counter-Reformation. Patron of archers' companies, St Sebastian has been very frequently represented in military costume, but at the Renaissance, he changes aspect to take on the form of a beautiful young man whose naked body artists delight to detail. Procaccini's composition is exemplary in this respect.Projected violently forward by a strong lighting which places the vertical movement of the composition into relief, St Sebastian occupies the whole foreground of the painting. To the right, the large distended wing of the angel perfectly matches the curves of this ""Christian Apollo"" in an ascending movement which appears to carry it upwards towards celestial glory. Five little angels flutter about at his sides tending his wounds, brandishing the instruments of his torture or handing him a martyr's palm. Despite the breathtaking beauty of the nude and the balance of every element of the picture, the painting exudes a deep sense of drama, and a rare intensity of pathos.Born in Bologna into a family of artists, Procaccini arrived when still a child at Milan, where he was probably trained in the workshop of his father Ercole and his brother Camillo. Between 1591 and 1599 he supplied several sculptures for the Milan Duomo, before becoming a major figure in Lombard painting in the early years of the 17th century. Commissioned in 1609, the St Sebastian must have been painted between 1610 and 1612, at the start of the most brilliant years of the painter's career, when Parmigianino's models commanded his full attention, inaugurating a new phase in his artistic evolution"

10980-204david.jpg	David exhibited at the Salon of 1789 The Loves of Paris and Helen, an important private work for the Count d'Artois, the king's dissolute brother. David had begun work on the painting in 1786, but, due to a long illness it was not completed until 1788. The Loves of Paris and Helen was a work on a new theme, and to express the amorous nature of the subject, David greatly modified the uncompromising and severe style of his previous paintings: the two figures are smooth and sculptural and are bathed in subtle light. David took great trouble over the details in this painting of courtship and physical attraction. A statue of Venus, goddess of love, is placed on a column at the left, and we also see two wreaths of myrtle, an evergreen sacred to Venus and an emblem of conjugal fidelity. For added, although incorrect, detail in the background, David included four caryatids copied from the Salle des Cent-Suisses in the Louvre.

04820-virgin_c.jpg	The panel is also called Madonna del Pergolato.Originating from the Chapel of St Sabinus in Orvieto Cathedral, this altarpiece is one of the most important paintings of the fifteenth-century Umbrian School. From 1445 onwards, Giovanni Boccati worked mainly in Perugia and was influenced partly by the Florentine masters Benozzo Gozzoli and Filippo Lippi but also by Piero della Francesca. He went on to develop a style of his own in which the interpretation is more lyrical and the means of expression more naive and immediate than those of his masters. His compositions, however, remained traditional, and in many of his paintings we find only slight variations of the arrangement seen in this picture.In this altarpiece the assembly of saints and angels surrounding the Virgin are placed under a pergola - hence the name given to the work. The back of the Virgin's throne is replaced by a leafy exedra, but the throne itself is of wood, decorated with certosina intarsia; the lateral walls and benches are marble, rendered in a uniform pink typical of the palette of Filippo Lippi

In the southern Netherlands, the new iconography appeared in Bruges, initially with Hans Memling's image of St Jerome before a rocky landscape of about 1485-90 and flourished about 1510 and after in the workshops of Gerard David and Adriaen Isenbrant.Gossart's painting follows composition developed in these workshops: Jerome is kneeling at the right with his lion, facing the cross with the crucified Christ attached to a tree at the left, his cardinal's hat is on the ground; the landscape is framed by rocky cliffs

06178-02left1.jpg	"Towards 1400 the court of Burgundy was an important centre of art. Commissioned by Philippe the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Melchior Broederlam, a native of Ypres - who, from 1384 onwards, served the Duke as ""peintre et valet de chambre"" - undertook the paintings on the lavishly decorated altar of the Carthusian monastery of Champmol. Left of centre the Virgin, seated at a lectern in a Gothic porch with traceried windows placed diagonally across the picture and leading to an elaborately designed building set behind it, listens to the words of the angel. This type of long, narrow building, supported on fragile columns, is to be found in the Italian paintings of Giotto's successors.

39443-5maggio2.jpg	The present decoration of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Hall of the Great Council) was realized after the disastrous fire of 1577 during which all the structures of the ship's-keel Gothic ceiling and the wall-paintings were destroyed. An immense flat ceiling, in accordance with the taste of the end of the century, was constructed with gilded cornices sculpted in high-relief, which framed a series of paintings. The canvases were dedicated, thematically, to the Glorification of Venice, in remembrance of the numerous military undertakings in the East or on the mainland by the Venetian ground troops. On the ceiling great importance was given to the victories of the Venetian army in conquering the mainland; along the wall to the dispute between Alexander III and Frederick Barbarossa, who reached an agreement in Venice with the political mediation of Doge Sebastiano Ziani; and to the events of the Fourth Crusade, led by Doge Enrico Dandolo in the early years of the 13th century.This painting is one of the large central canvases on the ceiling of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio.

15908-09warrio.jpg	A sense of calm and expressiveness as well as light effects are outstanding in this canvas, with the beautiful helmet and pieces of armour on foreground. The Renaissance must be the last period of world history when war could be seen as an aesthetic spectacle. Artists since then have made great art out of the horror of war, but Renaissance artists are able to enjoy it almost as theatre. Weapons and armour become object of beauty and were represented in art like still-lifes.Thought to be the Gattamelata's portrait - a famous Italian captain (1370-1443) - the picture has been ascribed to the last activity of Giorgione, dead in 1510, although the attribution is not certain since some critics referred it to other artists as Paolo Morando called il Cavazzola.Restored in 199

08996-11harbor.jpg	The composition is in some respects related to a drawing (LV 19) in Claude's Liber Veritatis, a drawn record kept by the artist himself of his finished paintings. The picture which LV 19 actually records is dated 1637 (Private collection, England). Although the present painting of 1643 is best described as an autograph replica of the earlier work, there are considerable differences between the two compositions. The round tower on the left of the earlier composition has been moved to the right, closer to the buildings seen on the shore, where it has been paired with another tower of similar design. The left edge of the later composition is dominated by two ships, balanced at the right edge by two porticoes instead of one. The man lying asleep in the foreground, who does not occur in LV 19 but is introduced into the painting of 1637, is retained in the present painting although the pose is reversed.The connections - albeit inexact - between this Harbour Scene and LV 19 have resulted in the painting being dated to 1637, but cleaning in 1969 confirmed the authenticity of the date of 1643. Once this was established the stylistic distinctions evident between works of the 1630s and the 1640s could be confirmed. The deep ultramarine tone of the water, the overall warmth of colour, and the more solid drawing of the figures, which, as a result, have a greater feeling of corporeality, are characteristic of the later decade. Comparison with the seaport scenes in the collections of the Duke of Northumberland and the Marquess of Bute, dating from 1637 and 1638 respectively, or with the rendering in Florence (Uffizi), also of 1638, reinforces these stylistic shifts. The picture in the Royal Collection was painted in the same year as Coast View with Mercury and Aglauros (Rome, Pallavicini collection) and Coast View with the Trojan Women setting Fire to their Fleet (New York, Metropolitan Museum). Three similar harbour scenes in the National Gallery, London, date from the 1640s and are comparable in style: Seaport with the Embarkation of Saint Ursula, Seaport of 1644, and Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba of 1648 - this last an inspiration to J. M. W. Turner.Harbour scenes occur frequently throughout Claude's oeuvre. Usually depicted at sunset and populated by a full cast of staffage figures, busying themselves by loading and unloading ships or simply idling the day away in conversation, these compositions and the mood they created found favour with British collectors and were emulated by British artists. The only firmly identifiable building in the present picture is the monumental gateway on the right next to the round tower. This is based on the Arcus Argentarium (Arch of the Silversmiths), dating from the third century AD at San Giorgio in Velabro, Rome, although it is seen in reverse and detached from the church. A view of this arch and the church occurs in an early drawing by Claude at Windsor Castle

06305-england.jpg	This famous image depicts two emigrants leaving England to start a new life abroad. The theme was inspired by the emigration of the sculptor Thomas Woolner, a fellow Pre-Raphaelite, who left for the goldfields of Australia in July 1852. In the same year, 369,000 emigrants left Britain to seek their fortune overseas.Brown himself, hardly able to make a living from his art, was contemplating emigrating to India when he began work on The Last of England. As the main focus of the picture he chose a middle-class couple. Beneath her shawl the woman cradles a small baby, whose tiny hand (modelled on that of Brown's own child) is just visible, grasping its mother's hand. The models for the figures were the artist himself and his second wife, Emma.The rather comical-looking cabbages arranged around the boat are intended to indicate a lengthy voyage. In the distance, the White Cliffs of Dover are just visible, while at the back of the boat a cabin boy is selecting vegetables for dinner from a small lifeboat, which bears the ironic name of the ship, Eldorado.The circular format is reminiscent of a Renaissance tondo, but also serves to emphasise the couple's unity

12591-3holzsch.jpg	Inscription in the top left: HIERONIMVS HOLTZSHVER ANNO DO[MI]NI 1526 AETATIS SVE 57; to the right, near the head, monogrammed.D�rer painted this portrait in Nuremberg in 1526, when the sitter was 57 years old. Hieronymus Holzschuher (1469-1529) came from an old Nuremberg patrician family. In 1500 he was elected junior, and nine years later senior burgomaster. In 1514 he ranked as one of the seven Elders of the city government, and on his death in 1529 a commemorative medal bearing his profile was struck. Holzschuher was a fearless champion of the reformation movement in Nuremberg. In D�rer, who was only slightly younger, he found both a sympathizer and a friend. When the painter visited the Netherlands in 1521, he bought presents for Holzschuher, a fact which he noted in his diary.The artist has filled almost the whole of the upper half of the panel with his subject's powerful head, for which the upper part of the body, clad in heavy fur, seems merely to serve as a plinth, attention being focused on the features. In this portrait D�rer has reproduced details with incredible fidelity. The fine brush has rendered the thick, wavy hair, which has receded somewhat over the forehead, with all the delicacy of a pen-and-ink drawing. At the same time, the face and the full lips are strongly modelled and determine the full-blooded vitality of the man. Reflected in the sitter's eyes are the window-bars of the room in which D�rer worked. D�rer himself fitted to the frame a sliding cover bearing Holzschuher's coat of arms; frame and cover are still extant in their original state and have served for centuries to protect the picture.D�rer was renowned for his ability to paint details, such as hair, realistically and it was pictures like this which are said to have led to his famous conversation with Giovanni Bellini in 1505 or 1506. The elderly Venetian painter had asked D�rer for one of the brushes which he used to execute his painstaking portraits. D�rer then handed Bellini a brush identical to ones the Venetian artist already used. `I do not mean this, I mean the brushes you use to paint several hairs with one touch,' Bellini responded. D�rer picked up the brush and demonstrated how he painted.In 1651 when the painter and art-historian Joachim von Sandrart was commissioned by some distinguished personality, possibly the Elector Maximilian I of Bavaria, to purchase the panel, his offer was turned down on the ground that it was intended to remain in the subject's family as a permanent memorial to him. During the eighteenth century the picture remained, well looked-after, in a groundfloor room of the family residence. Then, with the growth of romanticism in the early nineteenth century, there was a revival of interest in German painting and this famous portrait was brought out into the light of day. The new-found enthusiasm for D�rer's art made this particular portrait more popular than almost any other work of his. When it was publicly exhibited for the first time in Munich in 1869, it had already been accepted as epitomizing the old German patrician class. The portrait remained in the possession of Holzschuher's descendants in Nuremberg until it was purchased for the Berlin Gallery in 1884

18458-accord.jpg	This painting is the essence of Greuze, compositionally as well as in other ways. His preferred setting is an interior, a shallow stage-like area, normally with one right-angled wall; the figures are assembled in a loosely-knit frieze across the composition, a tendency increasing in his later work. Greuze concentrated on human nature, excluding the natural world and simplifying the setting so as not to distract from the gamut of emotions expressed by the faces. Each figure expresses an individual reaction to the moment. Disunity in the family is prophesied, for the mother tearfully must part with her daughter, whose younger sister is also saddened, while her elder is sullenly envious. The tearful, yet ineffective females contrast with the trio of men: the dignified father praising his daughter and exhorting his future son-in-law, a serious young man who receives girl, dowry and exhortation, and the sly peasant notary who literally documents the occasion and reminds us that it is as much legal as domestic

06550-coastal.jpg	This painting depicting a coastal landscape with fishermen with their catch by a ruined tower is a collaborative work of Jan Brueghel the Elder and Joos de Momper. The motif of the ruined tower is based on a building on the Via Appia in Rome, known as the Tower of Scipio, of which Brueghel made drawings during his stay in Rome. It is a recurring motif in Brueghel's paintings. Brueghel's friend Joos de Momper painted the figures. The friendship between Brueghel and de Momper is well known: as early as 1612-1613, Brueghel claimed to have painted the figures in six paintings by de Momper, in addition to the staffage for a series of The Four Seasons

35000-14italia.jpg	The Augustinian monastery complex of Santi Quattro Coronati on the north slope of Rome's Caelian Hill has a rich history dating to the earliest days of the Christian city. Construction of the first church was begun by Pope Miltiades in the 4th century on top of an aristocratic villa. It was one of the earliest Christian churches in Rome and its location made it one of the most important.It was during the 13th century renovation that some artistically and historically significant frescoes were painted. On the ground floor of the fortified side of the basilica, the Chapel of Saint Sylvester was adorned with legendary scenes from the life of Pope Sylvester I and one of the earliest surviving depictions of the Donation of Constantine.The present image shows Constantine bestowing temporal authority on Sylvester I

34275-venus_sa.jpg	This picture presents the artist in what was perhaps in those days the most popular light: as a master in painting graceful nudes and picturesquely evocative mythological scenes. The rhythm of the lines, the lively fire of the colours show the mature Ricci as a follower of the finest Venetian traditions, the heritage of Titian and Veronese. On the strength of stylistic relationships the date of The Sleeping Venus most likely falls in the late 1710s. It is closest in style to the Bacchus and Ariadne in Milan, and we may assume it was painted shortly after Ricci's return from England

The attempts by their despairing parents to get the two martyrs, strengthened in their faith by St Sebastian, to change their minds and abandon their faith is the subject of the crowded scene, which sticks very closely to the textual source. Idealized architecture conforming to the forms of Palladio and Sansovino provides the setting for the dramatic event. According to Ridolfi, the two paintings intended for the side walls of the ""presbytery"" were completed in 1565.

08838-joseph_p.jpg	"Joseph was the elder son of the Hebrew patriarch Jacob and of Rachel. His numerous older brothers were strictly only half-brothers, being the sons of Leah or of handmaidens. The events of his romantic life story have been depicted continuously in Christian art from the 6th century onwards. The medieval Church saw the episodes of his life as a prefiguration of the life of Christ, and it is to this that he owes his important place in Christian art.When in Egypt as a slave, Potiphar, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites and made him steward of his household (Gen. 39:7-20). Potiphar's wife 'cast her eyes over him and said, ""Come and lie with me.""' He refused her though she continued to press him. One day when they were alone together she clutched his robes, pleading with him to make love to her. At this, Joseph fled so precipitately that he left his cloak at her hands. When Potiphar came home she avenged her humiliation by accusing Joseph of trying to violate her, using the cloak as evidence. Joseph was promptly thrown into prison."

14446-211fried.jpg	In 1818, at the age of 44, Friedrich married Caroline Brommer, a cheerful 25 years old Saxon woman. That Caroline was a positive influence on the artist, which is evidenced by the fact that, from this point on, women appear with greater frequency in his work. A new, friendly element seems to enter his pictures. A case in point is the painting to which some authors give the title Woman before the Rising Sun, and which others call Woman before the Setting Sun. The woman seen in rear view appears as a large silhouette against the intense reddish-yellow of the sky. It is difficult to interpret the fervent gesture of her outstretched arms and the stylised rays radiating from the mountains on the hazy horizon, heralding the presence of the invisible sun.Caroline was probably the model for the female figure in old-German dress. Since she is stepping towards the light like an early Christian in prayer, some have sought to interpret the painting in terms of a communion with nature. On the other hand, the atmosphere evoked in Friedrich's painting might be interpreted as that of dusk, the path which terminates so abruptly as an announcement of death, and the boulders scattered alongside the path as symbols of faith. In the final analysis, few of Friedrich's pictures are as emphatic and almost exaggeratedly symbolic in their effect - factors which render the painting not unproblematic for the viewer

42765-5justina.jpg	After Justina had been baptized by Prosdocimo, the first bishop of Padua, she was brought up in the Christian faith. When the Emperor Maximilian came to Padua in 304, Justina heard of his persecutions of Christians, and immediately sought to instill courage in local believers. However, she herself was imprisoned, dragged before the emperor and instructed to sacrifice to Mars, the god of war. Her refusal to do so cost her her life.With its plethora of figures, the picture is a masterpiece of narration. The action begins in the background with a carriage drawn by two horses, which Justina has just left. She kneels on the bridge to pray, and is caught in a beam of heavenly light. The foreground is taken up with the scene of the martyrdom. Struck by the dagger, the prince's daughter yields humbly to her fate

34251-stormy.jpg	In his own time Marco Ricci was a popular landscape painter, highly appreciated, particularly in England, but with the passage of time his person and his works were forgotten and it was only after the exhibition in Belluno (1963) that his place in Venetian Settecento painting could be correctly estimated. The landscapes painted in his youth under the influence of Magnasco &#151; the Budapest picture is probably of that period &#151; are full of passion. In Ricci's pictures representations of a stormy sea, of trees torn by the wind, of a sailboat tossed by angry waters and foaming waves are not infrequent.

43858-the_ford.jpg	Jan Baptist Weenix was a versatile Italianate painter. He is best known for his views of the Campagna with emphasis on a mother and child seen against massive classical ruins, and fanciful Mediterranean seaports, but he also painted histories, portraits, and indoor genre scenes as well as some remarkable still-lifes with dead game. His son and pupil Jan Weenix (1642-1719) made a speciality of pictures of hunting trophies.Jan Baptist Weenix arrived in Rome in 1642-43 where he enjoyed the patronage of 'Kardinaal Pamfilio', who has been variously identified as Cardinal Giovanni Battista Pamphilj, who became Pope Innocent X in 1644, and as the Pope's nephew Cardinal Camillo Pamphilj. After he returned to Holland in 1646-47 he invariably signed himself Gio[vanni] Batt[ist]a Weenix. His adoption of the Italian translation of his Christian name and patronymic may have been in honour of Innocent X who gave him at least one commission.Jan Baptist Weenix executed this painting after his Italian journey. He gave a striking depiction of all the activity taking place at the foot of the ruins of a majestic temple with large pillars. The most salient feature is the gleaming white horse with decorated tail. Animals regularly appeared as staffage in landscape paintings, but here an individual specimen is given an especially prominent place.The painting is teaming with anecdotal detail. The horseman sits with his back to the viewer, talking with another man standing to the side. On his right a woman removes her red stocking; the boy next to her is already barefoot. Behind them a man carries a woman on his back, ready to ford the river. Finally a striking detail is the dog in the foreground, blatantly answering nature's call

09430-6shells.jpg	Coorte's known oeuvre consists of about sixty-four paintings.  Many of his compositions depict natural objects set on a stone ledge against a dark background. In the oeuvre six other shell still-lifes are recorded, each dated between 1696-1698. They contain a varied assortment of shells which differ quite dramatically in colour and shape. Coorte takes a clinical approach to painting his still-life elements, and thus the shells in the present painting are easily identifiable. From left to right they are: Lambis lambis, Tonna tessellate, Natica or Nerita (?), Cittarium pica, and Cyphoma gibbosum.Like the paintings themselves, the shells which served as the artist's subjects were objects of great rarity and desirability, which almost universally shipped from abroad by the Dutch East India and West India companies, and would have been collected for a Kunstkammer with a similar fervors to the paintings which depict them.The painting is signed and dated lower left: A.

24827-nativity.jpg	During the reign of Charles IV (1346-78) Bohemia experienced a political and cultural revival. The Prague workshops were dominated by two exceptional figures, the Master of Hohenfurth (Vissy Brod) and Master Theoderic. The Nativity by the Master of Hohenfurth is a panel painting from the abbey church of Hohenfurth. It has a number of stylistic similarities with Master Bertram's panels, in particular the stylized hills, miniature trees, and the plants set individually on mounds of earth.The hill formations, with their zig-zag pattern of trenches, derive from Giotto and Duccio. It is clear that the Master of Hohenfurth reworked themes from Giotto's Nativity in the Arena Chapel in Padua, an indication of the cultural network which linked the court in Prague with other European countries.

18103-2tosse.jpg	Two monumental shrines, of proportions similar to those of true chapels were frescoed by Benozzo Gozzoli at Castelfiorentino, on the initiative of a single client, Ser Grazia di Francesco, prior of Santa Maria at Castelnuovo Val d'Elsa: the Shrine of the Madonna della Tosse, and the Shrine of the Visitation. Among the assistants who were given the job of translating the master's ideas into painting was probably his son Francesco.The Shrine of the Madonna della Tosse originally stood on the road between Castelfiorentino and Castelnuovo Val d'Elsa. In 1853 a Neo-Gothic chapel was built around it in order to transform it into an oratory, however, this was not sufficient to arrest the deterioration of the murals. Detached and restored in 1970, they have been remounted in the Biblioteca Comunale. The focal point is formed by a wall fresco which creates the illusion of a lavishly framed altar painting with a predella. In order to support the illusion, Gozzoli painted a small pointed picture on the lower frame showing the face of Christ, just as if it had been added at a later stage in the manner of a votive picture.On the cross vault are depicted the four Evangelists and Christ Giving his Blessing, on the keystone. The Dormitio Virginis is on the left wall and the Assumption, with the delivery of the Virgin's girdle to St Thomas, on the right wall.The fading or even complete disappearance of the more fragile zones of colour has greatly impoverished the scenes, in which Benozzo has sought variety within symmetry, emphasizing the correspondences between the two wall scenes

19725-clifford.jpg	Nicholas Hilliard, a goldsmith and miniaturist, is one of the lesser known yet highly important artists of early Baroque. His unique achievement lies in his creation of a type of courtly portraiture unparalleled in European painting at the time. By his own admission, he was influenced by Hans Holbein, that peerless master of the portrait miniature, for whom Hilliard expressed his unreserved admiration in his writings.However, Hilliard's sophisticated and finely executed miniatures have little in common with the work of his German forerunner, apart from their mastery of fine technique and certain aesthetic principles such as the avoidance of chiaroscuro and strong modelling. These are features of an absolutely aristocratic stance in keeping with the attitudes displayed by the very people he painted.Hilliard's portrait of George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, from c. 1590, is a full-figure portrait, which is quite rare, and it is one of this artist's most complex works. This successful naval leader was a favourite of Elizabeth I and his feathered hat also bears the Queen's glove as a mark of distinction which adds the finishing touch to his courtly apparel in the guise of a knight

04754-vertemnu.jpg	Pomona, the classical goddess of fruit, and Vertumnus, the god of transformation, are the main figures in an episode in Ovid's Metamorphoses which is depicted here. Vertumnus enters Pomona's grove in order to convince her of his love. Because she had always run away on previous occasions when he came, he has cunningly dressed as an old woman on this occasion. By telling her about the allegory of the grapevine and elm, he is able to convince her of the importance of togetherness, for the grapevine needs something it can climb up and the elm, when considered on its own, is useless. Persuaded, Pomona gives in to love and her innermost longings and they become a couple.This is the last, largest and most accomplished of Bloemaert's treatments of this Ovidian subject, in which his earlier Mannerist traits have all but disappeared, to be replaced with a monumental classicism. The painting is signed and dated upper right: A.Bloemaert fc: / 1620

13896-dessert.jpg	The arrangement of various dessert to form a spiritual scenery, commented in detail in connection with Still-Life with Bread and Confectionary (St&#228;delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt), can also be found in other still-lifes by Flegel. His small-format Dessert Still-Life is dominated by the contrast between a parrot and a mouse, representing the principles of good and evil, respectively.The mouse is nibbling at the sweets and has already opened a walnut, which, according to St Augustine, is a symbol of Christ, the shell pointing to the wooden cross and the sweet fruit to Christ's divinity. Confectionery made of crystallized sugar, nuts, figs and raisins, some in a costly Chinese bowl and some outside it, represent spiritual principles which are being guarded, as it were, by the green-feathered parrot sitting on the far edge of the bowl. The religious context is further emphasized by the grapes and the wine glass, and indeed by the carnation. From the late Middle Ages onwards theologians saw carnations as a symbol of Christ's death on the cross, because of the nail-shaped form of petals and fruit. Furthermore, the coins at the front are probably another reference to the Passion, reminding us of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus for 30 pieces of silver

07333-miracle.jpg	This painting, hailed by Cano's contemporaries as a masterpiece, was part of the main altar in the no longer extant church of Santa Mar�a de le Almudena in Madrid. Damaged and all but forgotten, the painting entered the Prado in 1941, where its qualities can now be appreciated as they fully deserve.According to legend, the son of St Isidore fell into a well. Through the prayers of the saint and his wife, the water level rose miraculously so that the child was brought safely to the surface. Here, we see St Isidore standing in front of the well with his arms spread wide. The young woman is helping the child out of the well and looking towards her husband with an expression of astonishment on her face. Two servant girls in the background are commenting with eloquent gestures on the miracle. Two children and a dog, drawn towards the overflowing water, also discuss the event.Cano links two themes in this painting: the miracle itself and the recognition of Isidore's saintliness by the women. For the artist, this means presenting him in the manner of history painting and religious portraiture at the same time. He has solved this problem of duality by presenting the saint as an almost incidental figure barely involved in the event, a fact which has frequently been misinterpreted as a weakness of this painting

20369-10ingrex.jpg	In this portrait of a Russian diplomat, Ingres does not idealize his subject but uses him as a pretext for the expression of his own conception of the ideal.

37242-20dream.jpg	"Martin's generous gesture of the division of the cloak is followed by a dream, in which Christ reveals to him that he was really the beggar. Wrapped in the cloak, and pointing at Martin, Jesus addresses the host of angels accompanying him: some are shown praying, others listen to him with their arms crossed, while the mass of gold haloes helps give a sense of depth to the architectural setting. Meanwhile, Martin is sleeping under a blanket of typically Sienese fabric and Simone's realism is evident from one detail in particular: the border of the white sheet and the pillow are decorated with an embroidery called ""drawn-thread"" work, very fashionable at the time. The rigidity of the outstretched'body is intended to convey an intense spiritual participation in the message of Christ, and the way Martin's hand rests on his chest reveals excitement, as though he really were listening to the voice of the Lord"

42898-2ceilin3.jpg	The colourful fresco decoration of the Villa Barbaro reaches its climax in the Sala dell'Olimpo. The ceiling shows Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Apollo, Venus, Mercury and Diana, the seven gods of the sky, gathered around the figure of a woman riding a headless snake, who has been interpreted, inter alia, as an allegory of divine wisdom. As Richard Cocke has explained, however, it could be Thalia, who in conjunction with the eight muses of the transept and the gods of the sky illustrates the real theme of the dome fresco, i.e. the harmony of the spheres. The adjacent pictorial fields in the octagon illustrate the elements of fire, earth, water and air, represented by figures of the gods Vulcan, Cybele, Neptune and Juno.

07201-canal403.jpg	The picture showing traditional Venetian ceremony is from a series of 14 views of the Grand Canal painted by Canaletto and engraved by Antonio Visentini (published in 1735).The historical power of the Venetian Republic was dependent upon its mastery of the sea, both for trading and military purposes. Such dominance had waned by the eighteenth century, but past glories were symbolically recalled in ceremonies, such as the one depicted in this work.Here, a naval victory over Dalmatia which took place in 998 AD, apparently on Ascension Day, is commemorated. During the event the Doge travelled in the Bucintoro, the golden barge, out into the Lido, where he cast a ring into the sea, as a symbol of the marriage or union between Venice and the Adriatic. Such a ring had been given to a twelfth-century Doge by the Pope in gratitude for his peacemaking.The massive barge, designed by Stefano Conti and the last to be built before the fall of the Republic, has just returned from the Lido. The spectacle it creates, with its huge, brilliant orange flag fluttering before the sky, was clearly one that appealed to Canaletto. It is perhaps the archetypal Venetian scene, combining as it does elements of beauty, showiness, symbolism, and sheer delight in the physical appearance of the city

06228-panciat1.jpg	Official portraitist at the Medici court of Cosimo I, Bronzino painted also portraits of members of Florentine aristocracy or upper middle class, as Bartolomeo Panciatichi was. Born in 1507 and died in 1582, he held important public offices and lived in France as ambassador. In this picture he is around thirty years old, austere and proud, sitting before his family palace, whose coat of arm appears on the right. He also commissioned Bronzino to paint the portrait of his wife Lucrezia and the Sacra Famiglia con San Giovannino, both at Uffizi Gallery now.Here the influence of Parmigianino may be obvious, in the elongated figure and the vigorous line which creates broken surfaces on the sleeves of Bartolomeo Panciatichi. The imposing, idealized structure behind the portrait refers to fifteenth-century styles, while the lucid surfaces of colour define once again all the ideal and intellectual splendour of this man of the court: a work, therefore, totally in keeping with the taste and mentality of the Florentine painter.The painting was restored in 1970

09372-jordan.jpg	Constable met Maria Bicknell in 1800, when she was thirteen. She was the granddaughter of the rich Dr Rhudde, Rector of East Bergholt, Constable's native village. In 1811 they became engaged, but Maria's father, Solicitor to the Admiralty, and especially her grandfather the rector, opposed her union to 'a man below her in point of fortune, and...without a profession'. Constable's friend and biographer C.R. Leslie reports that for five years Maria was treated 'as if she were a boarding-school girl in danger of falling a prey to a fortune-hunter'. At 29, however, 'she felt entitled to determine for herself a matter which so entirely affected her own happiness.' They were married on 2 October 1816 at St Martin's Church by Constable's friend the Reverend John Fisher. Fisher invited them to stay with his wife of three months and himself in Osmington near Weymouth, 'The country here is wonderfully wild and sublime, and well worth a painter's visit.'There is some disagreement over whether this painting of Weymouth Bay is a sketch painted out of doors during Constable's honeymoon, or a later work prepared for sale on the basis of sketches made at this time and left unfinished. It seems so fresh and spontaneous that most viewers have wished it to be a direct record of Constable's visit, his easel set a little west of Redcliff Point, facing Jordan Hill and Furzy Cliff on a gusty October day. The reddish brown of the priming shows through the blue sky and water, lending a warm glow to the landscape, which is framed and 'pushed back' by a promontory on the right and rocks and pebbles at the lower edge, painted freely but in greater detail than the rest. The glory of Weymouth Bay, however is the cloudscape: clouds rising from the horizon to form the 'vault of the sky', that pictorial discovery of Dutch seventeenth-century marine painting.Constable's early employment in his father's mill must indeed have alerted him to the appearance and behaviour of clouds. It is all the more moving, therefore, to find that in his youthful exertions to train himself in art he had sat down and carefully copied and labelled a series of cloud patterns published in 1785 for the use of his pupils by Alexander Cozens, a landscape painter and drawing master. There are no more truthful studies of clouds than those by Constable, but even the observant windmiller had to acquire a vocabulary of representation before setting them down in paint

16641-ansanus.jpg	This picture is one of a series of predella panels presenting the life of St Ansanus, the patron saint of Siena. These panels are evidence that the flowering of the Sienese Renaissance exerted but little influence over Giovanni di Paolo. It is not that he simply a conservative. A thorough examination of his works shows that he noticed some of the novel solutions of his contemporaries and did take over this and that from Sassetta and from Gentile da Fabriano, and among the Florentines perhaps even from Masolino and Paolo Uccello. Nonetheless in his works he always built a peculiarly individual world, scenes with a strained rhythm and complicated construction, which are closer in character to late Gothic painting in the North Italian artistic centres than to what Tuscan artists prodused during his long life.In his picture at Esztergom, too, he translated the ceremony of baptism almost into the language of ballet: the nimble Ansanus, shown with small hands and feet, turns in a dance step to face the three catechumens about to be baptized. Behind them the others are shown in a veritable pantomime, in the various ways of disrobing. The elegancy of presentation mixed with a peculiar, wry grotesqueness and the splendid colours of this little scene put it in the first rank of the works by this master

00115-cook.jpg	"Firmly positioned in front of the imposing chimney-piece, the cook stands surrounded by the food she is preparing to cook: voluminous cabbages in a basket, and fowls and a leg of meat skewered on a spit which she holds firmly in one hand, whilst with the other she grabs a skimming ladle. The sculptural silhouette with its powerful arms, its solid body and vigorously modelled face radiates a strong sense of assurance. The fact that she is looking towards the unseen part of the room suggests that something is going on there that the viewer is unable to see. Pieter Aertsen made use several times of this form of composition in which a single, solidly-built figure occupies the entire panel in a vertical format which accentuates his or her solidity. This is an invention by the artist, which although originating in the foregrounds of the works of Jan van Hemessen, has no real precedent in the Antwerp painting of the period.Even though he never painted a picture not containing a human figure, Pieter Aertsen played an essential role in the emergence of the still-life by granting a dominating place to objects and to victuals, which he represents in all their triviality. Whilst every element appears to have been observed with attention to real-life detail, the image has nonetheless been recomposed in the studio. What cook would place small fowls and a heavy leg of lamb on the same spit? We also find the same kitchen utensils, furniture and victuals, differently interlinked, in many of the artist's compositions. Whilst the household objects are drawn from life, the classical lines of the chimney are taken from the architectural treaty of the Italian Sebastiano Serlio, whom Aertsen would have known from the Antwerp edition of his works in 1549.The total absence of religious subject matter, which still underlay all genre scenes at the time, is another stroke of daring by the painter, even if 16th century viewers would have immediately recognised, in the cook, the Martha of the gospel narrative, who is busy preparing the meal whilst her sister Mary is listening to Christ's words. This image also has a moralising content and should be read as a warning against the dangers of the pleasures of the flesh, ""voluptas carnis"""

The Pellegrinaio, situated on the ground floor of the hospital, is a fourteenth-century room which took the form of a long vaulted hall.In the four scenes on the west wall, painted by Domenico di Bartolo, we find large numbers of figures gathered in a stagelike foreground and engaged in the various good works assigned to the hospital by statute in 1305. The settings for these depictions of everyday work of the hospital may reproduce actual spaces within the complex.

18274-0813grec.jpg	It was only after El Greco moved to Spain that he treated the theme of the Madonna and Child in both half-length and full-length format, however, he invariably included St Joseph, in keeping with the new prominence the saint was given in Counter-Reformation theology. This painting from the Santa Leocadia in Toledo (presently on loan to the Museo de Santa Cruz) is El Greco's earliest version of the full-length depictions of the Holy Family. Two inferior paintings derive from it, a smaller version in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, and another in the Prado, Madrid. The primary difference between the Santa Leocadia version and the others is the substitution in those works of a conventional image of St Joseph for the balding figure that appears in this one. This figure is probably a portrait of the donor. It was painted out at one point and was only revealed by cleaning in 1981. Noteworthy is the figure of St John the Baptist: he turns towards the viewer and makes a gesture urging silence so that the child will not be awakened

09639-flowers2.jpg	This magnificent belongs to a set of six works of the same type, now all in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. It is assumed that they once formed part of the decoration of a convent or chapel. In their original context, these flower-pieces are likely to have been regarded as images of the natural world that lifted up the spirits of viewers in praise of its Creator. The figures of excited cherubs bearing flowers and fruit that are embossed on the wide gilded bowls emphasise the religious message.The bowls are filled with a dense arrangement of flowers and the blooms occupy the pictorial field in a manner that is characteristic of De la Corte's compositional horror vacui in his flower paintings. The abundance of blooms and tempestuous vitality of these are also typical qualities of his flower-pieces

14148-06landsc.jpg	This small painting on paper is among the few surviving oil sketches by Fragonard that plausibly could have been painted in the open air. It illuminates a little-known aspect of his practice as landscapist.In the mid-eighteenth century the custom of drawing outdoors was an established part of a young artist's training. Fragonard produced spectacular series of landscape drawings during his early sojourn in Italy from 1756 to 1761, when he was a pensioner at the Acad�mie de France in Rome. He continued to draw from nature throughout his career. Making open-air studies in oils, however, was still relatively unusual during this period

35811-ft_trunk.jpg	Rachel Ruysch, closely following Otto Marseus van Schrieck, also painted forest still-lifes. This painting is a particularly good example. As in van Schrieck's still-lifes, we look at dark undergrowth, dried stump with knotholes surrounded by toadstools and moss underneath stones. Winding around the dead tree trunks are brightly coloured flowers of all kinds, including roses, lilies and bindweed. They have a luminous quality which seems to come from within them. Insects, reptiles, and amphibians such as snakes, toads and small lizards, are partly fighting one another and partly destroying the plants together. On the left a toad and a small snake are attacking one another, on the right a fire-breathing (!) toad with red flames darting from its mouth is trying to hold a small lizard in check.Opposing the world of half-dead, flowerless plants and minerals, the glowing colours of the flowers add an element of vitality. These must be understood with a view to the Christian doctrine of salvation, symbolizing the purity of the Virgin Mary as well as Christian virtues or fruit of the Holy Spirit. This is also the context for the butterflies settling on the unopened blossom of a lily - undoubtedly an allusion to the mystical ('immaculate') conception of the Virgin Mary, as the lily had been a fixed attribute of the Mother of God since the late Middle Ages. Other insects, by contrast, are interpreted in a negative way. The locust climbing from the dead tree trunk to the red rose in order to destroy it, together with the stag beetle on the branch above it, just below the upper frame must be seen as an allusion to biblical text: 'He spoke and the locusts came, locusts and beetles without number...'

21961-4stanne.jpg	The theme of the Christ Child on the knee of the Virgin, who is herself seated on St Anne's lap, is fairly rare, but examples of it can be found from the Middle Ages onwards - the stream of life flowing through three generations. (Anna metterza: St Anne with the Virgin and Child.) Leonardo must have chosen this unusual theme for symbolic reasons, which have been variously interpreted. Sigmund Freud made out the shape of a vulture in the Virgin's garment, and suggested a psychoanalytical explanation: since as a child Leonardo dreamt that he had been attacked in his cradle by a vulture.There is a cartoon in the National Gallery in London by Leonardo of the same subject but differing in important respects from the Louvre painting. We know from a letter that Leonardo made another cartoon, now lost. The painting was commissioned by the Servites in Florence. It is unfinished; perhaps it was abandoned because of the artist's sudden interest in mathematics, and his engagement as engineer in the service of Cesare Borgia. Another hand seems to have finished the lamb which he had perhaps only sketched in; the landscape, St Anne, the Virgin and the Child Christ are the work of Leonardo himself. The paint is applied thinly, it is limpid and transparent, so that in some places the underlying sketch is visible. This has become apparent since the very dark varnish was lightened and some overpainting removed in 1953

03074-1illasi1.jpg	The Villa Pompei Carlotti in Illasi (Verona) was rebuilt between 1731 and 1737 according to the design of the owner, Alessandro Pompei, a patrician from Verona and a remarkable intellectual, architect, and virtuoso painter. In 1738, after the reconstruction was completed, the brothers Alberto and Alessandro Pompei asked Antonio Balestra, a renowned Veronese painter and Alessandro's former teacher, to create frescoes for the vast main hall. The other spaces in the villa were decorated by Balestra's disciples.The main hall, a luminous, double-height space that occupies the central portion of the building, is completely covered in faux architectural decoration. The lower portion of the wall surface is measured off by pairs of fluted columns of a composite order, which rest on a tall marmorino skirting board that circles the entire perimeter. The space between each pair of columns contains a depiction of a god, painted to imitate a marble statue. There are twelve in all. On the short walls, faux frames contain The Killing of Achilles and The Abduction of Helen. Above the doors, four ovals enclose monochrome mythological scenes. On the upper portion of the wall, twelve figures of cupids appear between pairs of pilasters.The vault of the ceiling is covered by The Triumph of Love, illusionistically supported by large, bulging corbels, set within an elaborate trompe l'oeil layout

The encircling amphitheatre of the Scar becomes a microcosm, and the beasts who graze or lock antlers before it - few of which had actually roamed there since much earlier times - emphasize its primordial state.

29207-trilog2.jpg	"Munk�csy had been working on the second picture of the trilogy for some time when he had himself put on the cross to feel the pain Christ must have felt. After 15 sketches and studies, the picture was ready by the Easter of 1884. Sedelmeyer had the picture ""Christ before Pilate"" brought back from Scotland and he showed both canvasses in the garden of his palace in Paris. The success was so frenetic that even Maupassant mentioned them in his novel ""Bel Ami"". The picture was first exhibited in the former Art Gallery (now Art School) in Budapest in September 1884. Munk�csy said that he had been thinking of painting a new picture on resurrection to make the trilogy complete. This plan could not be carried out because church leaders failed to raise enough money to keep both pictures in Hungary: Sedelmeyer required too high a sum for ""Golgotha"" so it was exhibited in Europe, then in New York, and then it was finally bought by John Wanamaker. Thus, it shared the fate of ""Christ before Pilate"" until 1988 when it was bought by Csaba Gyula Bereczki, a gallery owner of Hungarian origin. The picture is now exhibited with his permission.""Golgotha"" was a much more difficult task for Munk�csy than the first or third picture of the trilogy. The latter ones showed scenes indoors, while that of ""Golgota"" in open air on the Hill of the Skulls. Limited space was amjor factor in composing both pictures, whereas the huge space of the landscape almost swallows both groups of people: in the one group, Christ and the mourners are portrayed, and in the other a group on-lookers and passers-by can be seen. The most interesting figures are  portrayed in this delicately depicted group: an uninterested Jewish joiner, a Jew who is running away and beating his breast, and an Arab rider, a myterious, yet symbolic figure. The merits of the picture lie in expressive colours and the portrayal of landscape. The sky reflects the drama in a threatening way which cannot be helped and of which all evangelists reported briefly.After 107 years, ""Golgotha"" arrived  to Budapest in the autumn of 1991. After restoration by Mikl�s Szentkir�lyi, Istv�n Lente and P�ter Menr�th in 1992-93, it was exhibited in the Magyar Nemzeti M�zeum, Budapest at Easter 1993 and it has been on show in the Munk�csy Hall, D�ri Museum, Debrecen, since 1993"

29292-301muril.jpg	The tablet beneath the fictive frame of this self portrait is inscribed in Latin: 'Bart [olo] m� Murillo portraying himself to fulfil the wishes and prayers of his children.' By 1670, when this portrait was probably painted, only four of Murillo's nine children were still living. His only daughter had entered a Dominican convent, and his youngest son was deciding on a career in the church; he was later to become a canon of Seville Cathedral.After the artist's death, the painting was engraved in Antwerp at the request of Murillo's friend Nicolas de Omazur, a Flemish poet and silk merchant established in Seville. The portrait itself borrows a device from Netherlandish engravings, much used in the frontispiece of books. A gilded oval frame, set against a wall on a shelf or console table, encloses Murillo's half-length likeness. But in a feat of legerdemain only possible in art, it is the painter himself, not his image, who paradoxically extends his hand beyond the frame. Dressed in sober black, with a soft lace collar at his throat, he looks at the viewer with a dignified and slightly melancholy air. Nothing within this portrait betrays that he is anything other than a gentleman. Around the frame, however, are disposed the tools of his profession: a palette laid out with paint, brushes, a drawing in red chalk, the chalk itself, a pair of dividers and a ruler. The white on the palette is a real, three-dimensional swirl of white lead paint, not the image of one. The dividers and ruler tell us that he is a learned artist, creating pictures according to the rules and proportions of mathematical laws and not merely imitating appearances. A drawing - the academic basis of all the visual arts - recalls that in 1660 Murillo co-founded the Academy of Seville of which he was the first president.As in all his portraits, in contrast to his other pictures, Murillo emphasises truthfulness above charm. Strong light, casting dark shadows, is used to model the forms, and his famous 'soft' brushwork is apparent only in the hair and lace. The sombre colour scheme of black, white and ochre is relieved only by red - as indicated on the palette, where its undiluted presence helps to clarify the spatial construction of the painting and enlivens its solemn play on the art of reality and the reality of art

The spandrel is above the Jesse-David-Solomon lunette.The absolute immobility of the enigmatic figure depicted frontally provides a triking contrast to the activity of the woman in the opposite spandrel. Placed precisely on the axis of the triangle, she appears to be deep in meditation and totally extraneous to the two figures - a man and a child - that may be discerned behind her in the darkness.

43037-colleonl.jpg	In 1479 the Venetian authorities had decided to erect a monument to the mercenary Bartolomeo Colleoni of Bergamo who had died in 1475, leaving funds for an equestrian in his honour. He naively stipulated that it be sited in Piazza S. Marco, too prominent a place for this potentially dangerous symbol of power. Instead the authorities decided cleverly to put it before the remote Scuola di S. Marco. A competition was held and Verrocchio sent a life-size wax model of the horse in 1483. It was unfinished at his death in 1488, although he had completed the figure and horse in clay. In his will, he enjoined his pupil Lorenzo di Credi to finish it, but this responsibility was transferred in 1490 to the Venetian bronze caster Alessandro Leopardi (who designed the base and signed on the horse's girth)

24863-magdalen.jpg	With certain variations the arrangement of the present picture is a repetition of the wings of the Moulins triptych and is, presumably, the wing of a lost altarpiece. The unknown donor and the Magdalen, wearing the magnificent clothes of the period, are placed in a room with a checkered stone floor. The somewhat fleshy, not too attractive, face of the donor, her hair shaved high above her forehead, rises above a brown-red robe, with a rich brooch at the neck and an impressive gold chain decorating her bosom. A cameo is suspended from the string of pearls on her belt. St Mary Magdalen, the patron saint, holds her vase of ointment in her left hand and points with the right to the lady, kneeling in an attitude of prayer. The yellow silk cap of the saint is adorned with ropes of pearls, the sleeves of her bodice are blue, the bodice itself of red-blue brocade, and the mantle green. The Magdalen's features are finely drawn, with delicate nose and lips; both of the women's faces are painted in a portrait technique, the donor's being more strongly characterized. The painter's gift for portraiture is excellently displayed in this picture and so is his sense of lucid and harmonious composition and his feeling for colour.It is assumed that the donor is Madeleine de Bourgogn

37082-9decora1.jpg	The only one of the busts of philosophers and poets that can be identified with certainty is Dante Alighieri, and some of the loveliest and most famous of the monochromes are illustrations of episodes from the Divine Comedy - for the most part from Purgatory. In these Orvieto frescoes Signorelli proves that he is a talented illustrator of Dante, but what is truly fascinating is that he has succeeded in giving an interpretation of the Divine Comedy that is evocative and visionary, so similar to more modern styles that one can't help but compare it to the work of such artists as Fuseli, Blake, Gustave Dor�. If one is still searching for evidence of Luca Signorelli's inventive genius and of his astonishing versatility, then these decorations will provide it.The decorative scheme is the following.The series begins below the fresco of the Antichrist, with Homer and three episodes of Iliad. Below the Apocalypse Empedocles, the philosopher of Agrigento, who leans out to watch the scenes of his prophecy. The series of the poet goes on below the painting of the Resurrection, where Lucan is represented, with two scenes of Pharsalia (The slaughter of the Pompeians and the murder of Pompey).The figure of Horace is surrounded by four medallions, in which some stories taken from Hades are narrated. It seems that Ovid - in the following panel - is speaking to an invisible interlocutor. The four scenes represent episodes of the metamorphoses. Virgil looks amazed aat the scene of the Damned. Dante - with some sccenes taken from the first two cantoes of Purgatory - is working. Other two medallions represent the martyrdom of St Faustine and SDt Peter Parenzo killed by hte heretics of Orvieto (1190).This picture shows Dante and Virgil Entering Purgatory

23422-virgin_c.jpg	In the second half of the fourteenth century there are many instances of well-established Sienese master-painters collaborating on single commissions. It may be that the development was precipitated by the fact that there was not much work to go round and it had to be shared among different painters. But it seems more likely that the reverse was the case and that too much was being demanded of fewer specialist craftworkers. This large altarpiece signed on its lower edge by both Niccol&#242; di Ser Sozzo and Luca di Tomm� in 1362 provides a striking example of such collaboration. Now divested of its original piers, pinnacle panels and predella, the altarpiece was painted probably for the high altar of San Tommaso, a church under the care of the religious order known as the Humiliati. Accordingly, the apostle Thomas is portrayed on the Virgin's right-hand side, a position conventionally understood as that of greatest honour. To his right appears Saint John the Baptist, while Saints Benedict and Stephen appear to the left of the Virgin. The general consensus among art historians is that Niccol&#242; di Ser Sozzo painted the Virgin and Christ Child, Saint Benedict and Saint Stephen while Luca di Tomm� painted Saints John the Baptist and Thomas

33544-65portra.jpg	Catalogue number: Bredius 409.Although there is no documentary evidence, there is reason to connect Rembrandt's tender conception of Christ during the first years of his mature period with the teachings of the Mennonite sect. According to Baldinucci, one of the artist's seventeenth-century biographers, Rembrandt was a Mennonite, and we have seen that he was in contact with Cornelis Anslo, a famous Mennonite preacher of Amsterdam.In 1641 Rembrandt made an etching of Anslo, and in the same year he made the impressive double portrait of the preacher and his wife. In Rembrandt's day the Mennonite sect was a liberal one which discarded the sacerdotal idea, accepted no authority outside the Bible, limited baptism to believers, and held to freedom of conscience.

13268-bacchus.jpg	Opinions differ regarding the subject-matter of the picture. The museum catalogue lists it as Bacchus with Nymphs and Cupid, but has also been identified as 'Bacchus, Flora and Pomona', or 'Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus', or 'Bacchus and Ariadne on Naxos'.The image is dominated by the graceful, almost naked woman who leans back and smiles at us over her shoulder. Her gaze is sensual. The other figures, which are subordinate to and lower than the main figure, keep their eyes fixed on her. A surprising detail can be observed: the woman's right leg is poised on the knees of two lower legs which would seem to belong to the man behind her sipping from a flute glass. But from an anatomical point of view they could not be his.

12543-1adameve.jpg	The subject of Adam and Eve offered D�rer the opportunity to depict the ideal human figure. Painted in Nuremberg soon after his return from Venice, the panels were influenced by Italian art. D�rer's colouring is muted, and he models the bodies with the help of light and shadow, making the figures emerge from the dark background. Adam and Eve are noticeably slimmer than in his engraving of three years earlier.D�rer's Adam and Eve represent the earliest known life-size nudes in Northern art. Eve, whose skin is whiter than Adam's, is next to the Tree of Knowledge, standing in a curious position with one foot behind the other. Her right hand rests on a bough and with her left hand she accepts the ripe apple offered by the coiled serpent. On a tablet is the inscription: `Albrecht D�rer, Upper German, made this 1507 years after the Virgin's offspring.'

20063-04solonc.jpg	Honthorst painted this painting two years after returning from Italy. The influence of Caravaggio can be seen in the strong chiaroscuro, and that of the more classicist-oriented Bolognese masters in the sharp contours and overall colourfulness of the work.The subject is taken from the Greek author Herodotus. Croesus, king of Lydia, whose riches were proverbial, was said to have been visited by Solon the Athenian sage. The words of Solon - that the humble, when blessed with good fortune, were happier than Croesus with all his wealth - earned the king's displeasure. Later the Persian king Cyrus conquered Lydia and built a pyre for his vanquished foe. About to be burned alive, Croesus remembered the wisdom of Solon and thrice called out his name, which so roused the curiosity of Cyrus that he spared his victim's life.The painting shows Croesus wearing a magnificent robe, seated on his throne. Standing opposite him is the sage SOlon in more modest attire, pointing at the viewer with his right hand. Precious vessels made of silver and bowls brimming with silver and gold are heaped  in the foreground

32111-ox_cart.jpg	The Dutch Republic settled overseas territories as colonies, often gained in battle with other seafaring powers. For their apparent truthfulness, Dutch pictures show little of colonial working life, concentrating rather on colonial benefits to trade, art, and science. The most impressive colonial artistic project was the transcription in texts, maps, and pictures of the sites, peoples, fauna, and flora of eastern Brazil, under Dutch control from 1630 to 1654. Scientists trained in medicine, biology, and cartography, and artists, including Frans Post, gathered material for the 'Historia Naturalis Brasiliae', a large natural and ethnographic study of Brazil, illustrated with 533 woodcuts of exotic discoveries from swordfish to chiefs of indigenous tribes.Frans Post's records of Brazilian rivers, roads, and fields fit well-established schemes of Dutch landscape painting. But for its inclusion of workers of African origin and the exotic tree, his Ox Cart resembles near-contemporary Dutch pictures. Although not intended perniciously, such paintings of Dutch Brazil mark the indigenous scene as Dutch indeed, easily and rightfully accessible to Dutch cultivation

08564-4still1.jpg	In 1902, C�zanne bought a plot of land on the Chemin des Lauves, on an otherwise undeveloped hillside to the north of Aix, and had a two-storey house built with a large studio, some five metres high, on the first floor.

The ginger jar appears in numerous paintings from the 1890s, as do the straw-cased jar, the jugs and the pitcher.In the present still-life C�zanne shows the same object from two different viewpoints: the ginger jar is tilted forward so that we can see in through the top, but the sides of the jar are depicted frontally

21888-hercules.jpg	The mythological story depicted in the painting is the following.For murdering his friend Iphitus in a fit of madness Hercules was sold as a slave to Omphale, queen of Lydia, for three years (Apollodorus 2.6:3). But she soon alleviated his lot by making him her lover. While in her service he grew effeminate, wearing women's clothes and adornments, and spinning yarn.In the usual representation of the story Hercules is seated beside Omphale who is caressing him. The essential feature is the exchange of attributes. She wears his lion's skin and holds the club; he is draped in colourful robes and holds a distaff or spindle. Cupid is present. The subject is absent from classical Greek art, probably because it shows the hero in an unfavourable light, but it is found in Hellenistic times. In Renaissance and particularly Baroque painting it illustrates the idea of woman's domination of man.

13639-16ferenc.jpg	"In addition to producing brilliantly coloured plein-air paintings of subjects basking in sunshine, at Nagyb�nya Ferenczy also worked inside his studio, producing works of more restrained colouration. This particular work made in 1904, was the first in the series of nude paintings, which took up most of his attention in his last creative period.The theme of Ferenczy's ""snapshot"", which was actually carefully composed, was a painter instructing his model how to pose: with palette in his hand, the artist directs the nude model how to sit on the armrest of a chair. The colours are restrained and the picture has a homogeneous grayish-brown tone, in which only lighter masses of the two figures stand out. The painting's unity is primarily based on the rhythm  of the lines. The shaped line starting at the head of the painter runs along the arms and returns to the head of the model, encircles it and finally runs down along the curving line of the body. In addition to this curving line, the impersonal face of the female figure is also emphasized by the lavishly decorated picture frame glittering in the background"

03854-135barb.jpg	"The painting representing the Madonna and Child, St Mark, St Augustin and the kneeling Agostino Barbarigo, and musician angels is known as the Barbarigo Altarpiece. It is signed and dated in the centre of the Virgin's throne: ""IOANNES BELLINVS 1488"".The painting, one of the few chronologically undisputed points in Bellini's career, dates to 1488, the date written after the signature in the centre of the Virgin's throne. The first source concerning the altarpiece is the will of the person who commissioned it, Doge Agostino Barbarigo. Belonging to an important family of the Venetian aristocracy, Agostino, a unique case in the history of the Republic, had succeeded his elder brother Marco to the dogate, although the death of the latter, following a furious public argument between the two brothers over political differences, was seen by many as his responsibility. To demonstrate that he was the heir and loyal continuer of his brother's actions, in the first years of his office especially he had promoted a series of public artistic commissions (the Scala dei Giganti, entrusted to Marco and Pietro Lombardo, the Torre dell'Orologio of Mauro Codussi, the completion of the Ducal Palace with the building of the wing towards the Rio), aimed at a stately and hegemonic image of Venice, consonant with the political ideas which had been Marco's and which he had made his own. At the same time, in a private context, he was engaged in the erection of a grand funerary monument in Santa Maria della Carit&#224; for himself and his brother, commissioned Gentile Bellini with the official portrait of Marco for the series in the room of the Maggior Consiglio (a portrait that was executed between 1486 and 1487), and entrusted Giovanni Bellini with the task of painting a ""pala granda"" (large altarpiece), as a token of expiation for his moral debt, which he placed in the most prominent position of the main hall in the family palace.In the painting St Mark, with an expression of affectionate protection, presents the kneeling Agostino to the Virgin. According to the words of the Doge himself, both the background landscape and the walled fortress on the right (similar to the one in the Pesaro Altarpiece of some years before) refer semiologically to Mary. The withered tree, on the other hand, a symbol of death and of guilt that must be expiated, refer to the Doge's family disgrace.Dying in 1501, after a much-debated and variously evaluated dogate, Agostino left the canvas to the women's monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli at Murano ""because that figure of our Lady with angels is well suited to being placed above the high altar of her church..."". And he added, ""... And that neither our sons-in-law nor our daughters (Agostino had had five children, but the only son had died before him), nor our grand-children may put it in our great house, nor in any place other than above the high altar of that very pious monastery"". Nonetheless, the canvas was soon moved to make space for an Annunciation commissioned to Titian"

25230-2garam.jpg	"The picture shows one of the panels of the Garamszentbenedek Altarpiece.Nicholas, a canon of Gy�r, who was also cantor of the royal chapel in Buda Castle, in 1427 commissioned Master Thomas, painter of Coloswar (Kolozsv�r) to make a polyptych for the high altar of the Abbey Church at Garamszentbenedek (today Hronsky Benadik, Slovakia). Ending in a pointed arch, the central picture of the polyptych (which consists of nine panels) represents the Crucifixion, the internal wings are decorated with four episodes of the Passion and the external ones with scenes taken from the lives of several saints. (One of the latter has been lost, and so has the predella with the inscription about the donation.) The panel representing St Giles is the top quarter of the external wing on the right, its rounded corner following the line of the arch of the central picture.The hermit, who lived in a forest, was nurtured by the milk of a tame hind. The king's huntsmen pursued the animal, but when the saint interceded with the hunter he aimed his arrow at the holy man and instead of wounding the deer it pierced St Giles's breast. This moment is recorded in the painting. The saint bears the pain with a meditative, pious countenance. The arrow is depicted in the picture twice, perhaps because a single arrow rushing in the air may have introduced too great a tension and lack of balance into this lyrical scene. The hind taking refuge with the hermit is also characterized by calm stillness. The artist may have used a drawing from a model-book of the period for this work, which is indicated not only by the calmness of the animal as if it were part of a still life, but also by its movement: the model of the animal looks as if it had been drawn with all four legs underneath it, but the painter, adjusting the model to the painting, represented its right foreleg streched out. Though the hunter s figure is much smaller than that of St Giles, the lines of the rock in the foreground and the light colours of the foliage of the forest seem to lead one's eyes to him. In accordance with the style, which had a predilection for elegant, curving lines, the painter stressed the impressive and buoyant line of the bow, which is beautifully set off by the darkness of the forest.In the international life of King Sigismund of Luxembourg's court at Buda, Thomas de Coloswar had an opportunity to become familiar with the leading movements in painting of the period. The panel representing St Giles has similarities to Bohemian art. The rocky, wooded landscape - to quote Antal Hekler - ""the colour of a fairytale in spite of its awakening realism"" reveals features akin to the art of the Master of Trebon and the illuminators working under his influence"

19914-01southw.jpg	Richard Southwell (1504-1564) was one of Cromwell's most loyal and unscrupulous followers. As might be surmised from the somewhat cold and sinister expression on Southwell's face, he has come down to posterity as one of the most calculating and treacherous members of Henry VIII's court. He became a creature of Thomas Cromwell and was instrumental in aiding Richard Rich in his attempts to force the imprisoned Sir Thomas More to incriminate himself in 1532. Southwell also made accusations against a childhood friend, the Earl of Surrey, that led to the latter's execution. Cromwell employed him as a general factotum during the dissolution of the monasteries between 1536 and 1539. He was knighted (after Cromwell's downfall) in 1542. Southwell later abjured Protestantism, and thus found favour under Mary I (1553-58), but as a result he was shunned in Elizabeth's reign. He died c.1564.The darkly penetrating survey of the cold gaze of the sitter certainly does not flatter, but dares not condemn. Did Holbein's detached professionalism as a painter came under strain when depicting the agent of destruction of More, his first major patron? The simplicity of the background and the emphatic linearity of the design accentuate the overall sense of calculation, as though the artist wanted to concentrate on abstract elements. In this the picture has an affinity with Bronzino's portraits of the contemporary Medici court at Florence. Appropriately, the work was later given by the great connoisseur and collector, the Earl of Arundel, to Cosimo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in the seventeenth century

09838-courb103.jpg	"Like Romanticism, Realism was a broad cultural movement in the 19th century that had its origin in literature and philosophy. In painting, its most prominent representative was Gustave Courbet. His Stonebreakers represented workers, as he had seen them, in monumental form.The Stonebreakers, destroyed during the bombing of Dresden in 1945, was the first of Courbet's great works. The Socialist philosopher Proudhon described it as an icon of the peasant world. But for Courbet it was simply a memory of something he had seen: two men breaking stones beside the road. He told his friends the art critic Francis Wey and Champfleury: ""It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning."

08671-03peeli.jpg	This interior is reminiscent of the interiors of David Teniers' era. Light and colour are subdued, nothing is sudden or jarring. However, the reference to Netherlandish kitchen scenes is merely superficial, for the similarity is restricted only to the choice of props and the predominantly brown colouring. It would also be wrong to see any allegorical statement in this scene. It simply shows a kitchen maid in an indeterminate room, pausing for a moment in her work. Her expression is one of neither sadness nor joy, her gaze is aimless but not forlorn. The pictorial space, which initially appears to be firmly bounded, turns out to be a kind of nowhere, whose shelter is created entirely by an inner integrity. The moment of contentment and repose freezes into timelessness, into an eternity that harbours a refuge from fear and transience.Chardin exhibited this work at the Salon of 1739 as La ratisseuse de navets (Woman Scraping Turnips). He painted four versions of the Kitchen Maid. In addition to the Washington version, there is one in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and another in the collection of the Rijksdienst Beeldende Kunst in the Netherlands.  A signed version is lost since 1918

19570-regents.jpg	A marked change in the Dutch portraitist's conception of his task becomes apparent in the work of Bartholomeus van der Helst. His portraits take on some of Van Dyck's elegance, which began to affect Dutch art about 1640. Adriaen Hanneman (1610-71) returned to The Hague with Van Dyckian motifs about 1637, after more than a ten-year stay in England, and the portraits he and his pupils made for courtly patrons helped to set the new fashion.Van der Helst's marriage in Amsterdam in 1636 suggests he had settled there by then. In the following year, at the age of twenty-four, he was commissioned to paint the Regents of the Walloon Orphanage, his earliest existing dated work.

19229-86regen.jpg	"The two large format group portraits of the Regents and Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse in Haarlem are not only one of the last major work by this artist who ranks beside Rembrandt as the greatest of all portrait painters, they are also the last historically significant examples of this genre.Whereas Hals previously presented individual gestures, attitudes and poses in a ceremonial and more than momentary context, here he isolates the individual parts and the individuals themselves. The faces above the white collars seem to float against the dark ground of a room that is difficult to distinguish. The ""breakdown"" of the figurative corresponds to the brushwork whose ductus is no longer fluid, but broken so that it seems to crumble into particles of colour. Here and there, a shimmer of red flares up through the black like the final glimmer of dying embers in the ashes.Whereas the iconography of vanitas and the theme of transience were previously expressed through specific symbols in Dutch painting, we now find that the most vigorous genre of all - the group portrait - has also been imbued with the concept of mortality. Old age and death seem to menace, where once there was activity and sociability"

43999-00beaun1.jpg	"The Last Judgment polyptych is Rogier van der Weyden's largest work. Together with the Van Eyck brothers' Adoration of the Lamb, this is one of the absolute masterpieces of the golden age of Flemish painting.The enormous polyptych is made up of fifteen panels of different sizes. It was painted by Rogier Van der Weyden and his studio for the ""great hall of the poor"" in the H�tel-Dieu in Beaune. This hospital was founded by the fabulously wealthy Chancellor Rolin, and his devout third wife, Guigonne de Salins, for the salvation of their souls and in the hope of storing up treasures in heaven. Work began in 1443. The room was a vast open nave, with a panelled barrel vault for a ceiling, and could contain thirty canopied beds along its two long walls. The polyptych was placed at one end of this space, behind the altar, in a chapel separated from the nave by an ""open-work wooden partition"", through which patients could follow the divine service from their sick beds.As long as the polyptych hung in the chapel, it was traditional to open the wings on Sundays and solemn feast days. But since it has been restored, it is now kept in a neighbouring room which is air-conditioned to prevent any further deterioration due to the heat generated by the three hundred thousand visitors who come to see it each year. The panels were sawn in half across the thickness of the wood a few years ago, and both front and the reverse are now exhibited simultaneously, side by side.On either side of the central figures of Christ and the archangel Michael, the composition is built up on two levels. Above is a cloud of gold, on which are seated the apostles, judges in the celestial tribunal, as well as a pope, a bishop, a king, a monk and three women. Below them is the earth, from which the resurrected souls emerge, to go either to damnation or to eternal bliss. The central panel is dominated by the son of God, seated on a semi-circular rainbow, with the Virgin Mary at one end of the arc and St John the Baptist at the other. Christ's feet rest on a sphere, symbol of the universe. With his right hand, he blesses those who are saved and with his left curses those who are damned. These two gestures are emphasized by appropriate emblems, respectively, a lily and a blazing sword. Beneath Christ stands St Michael, prince of the heavenly hosts. He is pictured as young, because he is immortal and as handsome, because he is the embodiment of divine justice. He holds in his hands a scale in which he weighs souls. The souls are represented by two little naked figures, whose names are ""Virtutes"" and ""Peccata"". The former kneels, overcome with delight, while the latter seems horrified and screams with terror.The lower tier depicts the elect and the damned. They are represented by two small groups of figures. They too are naked and are portrayed on a smaller, more human scale, than the saints above them. We see them propelled inexorably towards their fate. The damned are crushed beneath the weight of their sins. They have themselves painfully up out of the cracked dry earth, surrounded by sparks of fire and wisps of smoke. In contrast, on the opposite side of the polyptych, as one approaches paradise, flowers grow more and more abundant. In Van der Weyden's time, woman was regarded as a temptress and it was therefore more difficult for her to be saved than for a man - hence there are only two women in the group which, lead by an angel, are about to ascend to heaven. It was also believed that lunatics were possessed by demons. Here, the figures of the damned are tortured and deformed by hatred and their faces distorted by madness. Gripped by a collective hysteria, they are unable to weep, but instead scream and fight, as their folly draws them on towards eternal punishment. At the far left-hand side of the polyptych, paradise is represented as a gothic porch ablaze with light, the door that leads to the divine dwelling place. On the other side, hell is strangely lacking in devils. Instead, it is merely represented by a pile of dark rocks spewing flames and volcanic vapours"

07938-f_egypt.jpg	"When the frescoes of Annibale Carracci on the ceiling of the Galleria Farnese were unveiled on June 2, 1601, one of those present was Pietro Aldobrandini, Clement VIII's nephew and Secretary of State. This is probably what led to a relationship between the cardinal and the Emilian painter, resulting in the former commissioning a painting entitled Domine quo vadis? (now in the National Gallery in London) from the artist the following year. He also asked him to decorate, between 1603 and 1604, six lunettes in his private chapel. This no longer exists, but at the time was located in what is today the private entrance to the apartment of Palazzo Doria Pamphilj al Corso. An old plan shows that it had three entrances and six walls of different sizes, two large, two middle-sized, and two small, on which the six lunettes were placed. The Flight into Egypt, one of the two biggest, was probably located on the wall in front of the altar, to the right of the entrance that led into what is now the Aldobrandini room. It is very likely that Annibale Carracci had made the designs for all six of the canvases, but when he fell ill in 1605, the commission passed to his assistant Francesco Albani, who received the first payment in that year. Shortly afterwards, on May 21 1606, Pietro Aldobrandini, who had fallen out with Paul V, left Rome and did not return until 1610. Meanwhile, the work proceeded under the supervision of Albani, who did not receive the final payment until 1613.The critics agree that only the Flight into Egypt and the Deposition are entirely the master's work, while the other four paintings - the Visitation, the Adoration of the Shepherds, the Adoration of the Magi, and the Assumption were painted by his collaborators Giovanni Lanfranco, Sisto Badalocchio, Domenichino, and Francesco Albani, though it is difficult to determine their individual contributions to the joint undertaking.The ""classical,"" composed, measured and ideal landscape of the Flight into Egypt, - one of the works that set the ground rules for seventeenth-century painting - spilled over, in harmony with the Aristotelian views of Agucchi, popular in Farnese-Aldobrandini circles, into the work of Poussin. Indeed its influence spread even further afield, to the German classicists Anton Koch and Philipp Hackert. The restful setting, the gently undulating planes that extend to the distant horizon, and even the boat - a symbol of life - floating on a peaceful river in the foreground create a most unusual atmosphere, based on the effect of repetition. This motif of the ""already seen"" and known, a constant feature of Italian landscape painting, from Carracci to Domenichino, from Viola to Grimaldi, and from Dughet to van Bloemen, always gives rise to a pleasing sense of familiarity"

37244-30knight.jpg	"The stories of the life of St Martin that Simone could have used as sources, although none of them mention an actual investiture, do contain references to his military promotions. We can therefore suppose that our painter, surrounded by a world of tournaments and hunting expeditions, pictured a Roman soldier rather like a mediaeval miles and simply transposed a ceremony typical of his times to the late classical world. It is not merely a matter of Panofsky's ""theory of distance,"" according to which mediaeval painters made characters from the past appear more immediate and closer to their public by placing them in Gothic architectural settings and dressing them in 13th-century costumes. Simone (and even more so his patrons who had commissioned the frescoes) used the scene of Martin's investiture to focus attention on courtly and aristocratic customs.Musicians, singers, equerries with weapons and falconers all witness the scene taking place inside a palace with loggias and wooden ceilings. Nothing could be more secular than the figure of the Roman Emperor fastening the sword, the symbol of his newly acquired dignity, around the knight's waist. The Emperor's immobile profile, with his half-open mouth and fixed gaze, is reminiscent of the portraits carved on ancient Roman coins, which Simone probably used as a model: even though it must be Julian the Apostate (and historically it could not be any other emperor), it has been suggested that the features are actually those of Constantine the Great"

35652-14sketch.jpg	Rubens was very keen on classical antiquity and this sketch in the Brussels museum evokes this facet of his genius. In it Cupid is guiding by the bridle a dolphin that is slicing through the sea. In his right hand he carries a bow, on his back a quiver of arrows, illustrating a passage from the Latin poet Ovid's Metamorphoses where the little god of love is preparing to unleash arrows in order to conquer hearts for Venus, and symbolising the impatience of love.Rubens was fond of Ovid's narratives, which he illustrated several times. Cupid Riding a Dolphin is part of a series of sketches that Rubens made for the decoration of the Torre de la Parada, the Spanish kings' hunting lodge close to Madrid. In 1636, Philip IV commissioned for this residence a series of paintings to be completed in just under a year. Almost half of these works were paintings of animals, along with hunting scenes and pictures of the king. The monarch turned to Rubens for the paintings of subjects taken from the verses of the Latin poet. The animals and the hunting scenes are a direct reference to the destination of the building, whilst Ovid's mythological poems create the atmosphere of bucolic entertainment which is appropriate for such a country dwelling. This is the last, and largest, commission that Rubens received, consisting of around a hundred works. The artist did the sketches himself but painted only a few pictures, entrusting the execution of most of the canvases to his close collaborators Cornelis de Vos, Theodoor van Thulden, Erasmus Quellinus the Younger, Jan Eyck and Jacob Jordaens. Some forty of the paintings are conserved at the Prado in Madrid. The Brussels museum owns twelve of the fifty or so sketches that are still extant.Cupid Riding a Dolphin is exemplary of the spontaneity and energy which show through in all of the master's sketches. Thicker touches on top of the fine ground layer highlight the dolphin's impetuous movement, whilst isolated touches of colour indicate the colour scheme of the composition. The final painting was produced by Erasmus Quellinus the Younger (Madrid, Prado).

05063-annuncia.jpg	This is one of the few religious pictures by the artist. It reveals his Roman Catholic background, and shows him working in the Utrecht tradition of monumental religious painting established by Abraham Bloemaert, whose preference for robing his figures in lavish and colourful betassled and gold embroidered liturgical dress is reflected here in the thoroughly episcopal Angel of the Annunciation. This figure, and the equally almost monumental Virgin, kneeling in a dark blue dress, dominate the picture frame, allowing the artist to purge the composition of almost all extraneous detail

43458-oude2.jpg	Van Vliet, a prolific Delft painter, carried on the Houckgeest-de Witte tradition in painting church interiors. He was first active as a portraitist and turned to painting church interiors in 1652.Using a diagonal construction van Vliet's interior of the Old Church at Delft offers a report on a significant new addition to the venerable church. It includes a full-view of the elaborate monument dedicated to Admiral Maerten Tromp which was unveiled in 1658, the year the picture is dated.Not many people in front of the tomb had to be reminded that Tromp, whose most glorious victory was the defeat of the Spanish with a Dutch fleet much inferior in strength at the Battle of the Downs in 1639, was killed in the furious Battle of Scheveningen five years before the monument was dedicated. Most of them also knew that the tomb that can be glimpsed deep in the church's choir belongs to Admiral Piet Hein whose capture of the Spanish silver fleet in 1628 made him a national hero particularly adored by the shareholders of the Dutch West Indies Company who, thanks to his prize, received a fifty per cent dividend on their shares that year; his coup also filled the treasury of the northern Netherlands and enabled Frederik Hendrick to lay siege and subdue 's-Hertogenbosch, a Spanish stronghold in the south, with nearly 30,000 men.The modest slab-less tomb on the church's floor and the gravedigger who has paused to chat with a visitor, both familiar details in church interiors of the period, are reminders of the transience of more ordinary mortals. His painting includes children and dogs; well and less well-trained children and dogs are not infrequent accessories in these paintings

13774-melancho.jpg	"Melancholy quite literally means ""black bile"" indicating the origins of this concept based on the ancient theory of the four body fluids that were believed to determine an individual's temperament.According to this theory, the emotions and personality traits could be explained by specific physical attributes and were associated with certain qualities: in this case all things dry, cold and heavy. Accordingly, melancholy is associated with the element of earth, the season of winter, the astronomical constellation of Saturn, the leaden star.Fetti portrays all this in his painting: the head of the woman lies heavy in her hand, her flesh is heavy, her eyelids heavy. The setting is a gloomy landscape of ruins, with no green shoots of spring and without the fruits of summer. Brown tones dominate.Yet the philosophical temperament of melancholy, rediscovered by the Neoplatonic philosophers in Florence, is already evident. The deep contemplation of the skull, the abandoned tools (plane, palette, brush and plaster model of a torso), the unused attributes of science (astrolabe, book and geometric theory) show that melancholy is not simply a creature helpless against fits of depression, but also a talented and knowing creature, whose inaction stems only from an awareness of insoluble problems."

St Joseph sits in the background to the left under the shelter of several ruined classical buildings.

36943-jatte.jpg	"This painting, shown at the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886, served as the manifesto of Neo-Impressionism. Seurat adopted certain elements of the Impressionist tradition (he made outdoor colour studies and he retained the light tonality of the Impressionist palette), but his training took place well away from the protagonists of modern art, following a highly personal course from the outset. He took up colour by reading scientific books on optical phenomena. In the scientific literature a number of principles were formulated that subsequently formed the theoretical base of Neo-Impressionism: the distinction between hue and tone (or colour and value)), the idea of the optical mixing effected by the retina, and the coloured vibrations obtained by juxtaposing different tones of the same hue.In Neo-Impressionism the conflict between representation and abstraction was glaring. The tendency to treat figures as coloured silhouettes reached its height in A Sunday Afternoon on the Ile de la Grande Jatte in which ""the stiffness of the characters and the incisive shapes help to generate the sound of modernity.""In this best-known and largest painting, Georges Seurat depicted people relaxing in a suburban park on an island in the Seine River called La Grande Jatte. The artist worked on the painting in several campaigns, beginning in 1884 with a layer of small horizontal brushstrokes of complementary colours. He later added small dots, also in complementary colours, that appear as solid and luminous forms when seen from a distance. Seurat made the final changes to La Grande Jatte in 1889. He restretched the canvas in order to add a painted border of red, orange, and blue dots that provides a visual transition between the interior of the painting and his specially designed white frame"

It was commissioned by �gost Trefort, Minister of Culture, in 1874 for the Hungarian National Museum.Art historians often connect M�sz�ly's name with that of Camille Corot and by the beginning of this century he was labelled ""the Hungarian Corot"". Indeed, M�sz�ly's art is related to Corot's and the later French plein air painters. With their mother-of-pearl, hazy colours, the pictorial values of representation and their intimate mood, they are quite reminiscent of the great lyricist among nineteenth-century French landscape painters.  No wonder that foreign art dealers sold M�sz�ly's pictures signed with Corot's name to American collectors.

17906-dunes.jpg	The earliest works of van Goyen are so close to Esaias van der Velde's that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish their hands. Like Esaias, he used both a round and an oblong format for small views of Dutch villages and country roads, crowded with illustrative details. The atmospheric treatment in these colourful early works is insignificant, the foliage is ornamental, and there are glittering highlights reminiscent of the Mannerists. In the late 1620s van Goyen shifted to simpler motifs - a few cottages along a village road or in the dunes, like in this painting - and he achieved unification and depth by a leading diagonal and by a tonal treatment that subdues the local colour and is expressive of atmospheric life. His palette turned monochromatic, with browns, pale greens, and yellows

But then perhaps a renewed interest in Elsheimer, or contact with Filippo Napoletano taught him the poetics of both nocturnal and diurnal light. Light for Tassi becomes a mood and it is Claude who eventually develops this. While Tassi carefully observed and selected the natural phenomena around him, he did not abstract them. His skies, with their diagonal streaks of pink, can often be seen in Roman sunsets. His imposing beeches and elegant umbrella pines are truly those of the Roman countryside.

14951-4arles05.jpg	Originally, the work was entitled Grape Harvest at Arles, but Gauguin later renamed it Human Anguish, lest its symbolic connotations be overlooked. The pose of the crouching female figure in the foreground was a direct quotation from a Peruvian mummy that Gauguin had seen in the ethnographic museum in Paris, and which was to recur in later works, most notably in Where Do We Come From. Her pose evokes grief and guilt, perhaps sexual guilt, ironically referred to in the abundance of the harvest which surrounds her. Indeed, the backdrop of the harvest is treated like water, with the suggestion of frothy waves in the foreground, which for Gauguin represented female sexual abandonment. The picture may be meant to evoke a post-seduction scene, a theme which Gauguin explored to its fullest in The Loss of Virginity.That the scene, painted at the beginning of November 1888, was executed from the imagination and not from life is evident from the fact that the scene is peopled with Breton peasant women whom Gauguin could not have seen for several months

42829-04lattu1.jpg	In the last decade of his life Veronese painted a large decorative cycle of eleven canvases for the Venetian church of San Nicol&#242; dei Frari, popularly known as San Nicol&#242; della Lattuga, which was stripped of its ornaments in 1806. Three of the paintings (Saint Nicholas named Bishop of Myra, Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata and the Crucifixion) are now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. The Adoration of the Magi, surrounded by four figures of Evangelists, was adapted and mounted on the ceiling of the presbytery of the chapel of the Rosary in Santi Giovanni e Paolo in 1929. The large canvas depicting the Baptism and Temptations of Christ, formerly in the chancel of San Nicol&#242;, was transferred to Brera in 1809. Finally, the two Prophets in monochrome that were originally located at the sides of the high altar are now in the Fondazione Cini in Venice.This work belongs to this series. Damaged at the sides, only the central part of the composition remains. Two groups of figures form the two parallel diagonals, one coming forward, the other with St Nicholas held back. The subtlety of the Veronesian palette is as ever remarkable for the variation of tone, here used to create a naturalistic effect.In his narration of the episodes Veronese gave expression to a dramatic tension, an intensely emotional involvement that was certainly unprecedented in his earlier handling of similar subjects. To achieve this, he profoundly modified his normal modes of expression, creating new structures of composition that he would use frequently in his paintings from this moment on

44267-virginal.jpg	Restraint is a quality that permeates de Witte's genre pictures. In his richly furnished domestic Interior with a Woman at the Virginals the man in the curtained bed with his clothing and his sword draped over a nearby chair are not the first things noticed when we confront its palpable space, strong sunlight, and sonorous colour harmonies. If Mondrian saw the painting it is not hard to imagine that he would have nodded his head in approval at the banded pattern made by the light on the interior's marble floor. His approval, however, would have been anachronistic if he did not correlate it with the artist's effort to create a plausible illusion of space on the two-dimensional surface of the canvas. Like other seventeenth-century Dutch artists, de Witte saw an inextricable link between a picture's formal qualities and its illusionism
