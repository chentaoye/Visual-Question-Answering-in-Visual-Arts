QUESTION,COMMENT,ANSWER
Who was seized?,"Mucius Scaevola (Livy 2:12-13) was a hero of Roman legend. When the Etruscan forces, led by Lars Porsena, king of Clusium, were besieging Rome, a young Roman nobleman, Caius Mucius, succeeded in penetrating the enemy lines in disguise, meaning to kill Porsena. By mistake he killed the king's secretary who was sitting beside him. Mucius was seized but, to show how cheaply he held his life, thrust his right hand into the flames of an altar fire and let it burn. Porsena, amazed by his endurance, set him free. He was thereafter called Scaevola, meaning 'left-handed'.In painting, of the Renaissance and later, Mucius stands for the virtues of patience and constancy. His sacrifice was also held to be a prefiguration of Christ's sacrifice",Mucius

Van Miereveld went to The Hague to record his subjects's features and produced this portrait of the prince in armour, with sword and baton, representing his role as captain general of the Dutch army. This picture became the model for all the later portraits of the prince. (A full-length version of this portrait from 1615-20 is now in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.) The portrait was engraved by Jan Muller in 1608and, like countless copies from Van Mireveld's workshop, hung in homes throughout the Netherlands.

What did Lorenzo Ghiberti quote other works of the master in?,"The crucifix was first attributed to Giotto by Lorenzo Ghiberti, who in his Commentaries quoted other works of the master in the altars of the church of Ognissanti, like the Virgin of Ognissanti and the Dormitio Virginis. Originally it was probably located on the presbytery, dominating the nave and the faithful, near the Virgin of Ognissanti.In poor condition, it was kept in a room adjacent to the basilica and attributed to an artist close to Giotto and possessing great pictorial capacities.The work was restored from 2005 onwards by Opificio delle pietre dura from Florence and was attributed to Giotto himself, for a date which is around 1315. On November 6, 2010, the crucifix was reinstalled inside the left transept, enhanced by proper illumination.Intended for the procession, it is in conformity with the monumental representations of Christ in the cross of the time, namely: the Christ on the cross is in the suffering position; the body falling; the belly prominent on its perizonium; the head leaning forward touching the shoulder; the prominent ribs; the bloody wounds; the superimposed feet.The crucifix has small panels with scenes on the ends of the cross: the Virgin Mary on the left clothed in blue, St John on the right, hands clasped, and on top the titulus in red is surmounted by a blessing Christ accompanied by the Book. The background contains patterned gold behind the body of Christ.The cleaning and retouching of the blackened cross has revealed individual brush strokes and the bright colour of the lapis lazuli used by the artist.

What did Bourdon set for middle-class French portraiture for almost the rest of the century with his curious mixture of Italian influences?,"In Rome the young Bourdon was exposed to some of the greatest portraits of the Renaissance in the collections there, as well as to the constant experiments of artists as diverse as Bernini, Lanfranco and Domenichino, who all painted portraits. from all these influences Bourdon compounded his own style, which inevitably became a formula, but a successful one.

What increases in both height and depth colours become more vivid?,"During the years from about 1650 to about 1655, the heroic quality of Ruisdael's landscapes increases. The forms become larger and more massive. Giant oaks and beeches as well as shrubs acquire an unprecedented abundance and fullness. Colours become more vivid, space increases in both height and depth, and there is an emphasis on the tectonic structure of the compositions. He strove to achieve heroic effects without sacrificing the individuality of a single tree or bush. An outstanding example of this tendency is his mighty view of Bentheim Castle.Ruisdael visited Bentheim, a small town in Wesphalia near the Dutch-German border, when he travelled to the region with his friend Berchem in the early fifties. Bentheim's castle is, in fact, on an unimposing low hill, but in his painting Ruisdael enlarged it into a wooded mountain providing the castle with a commanding position. His invention is a superb expression of his aggrandizement of solid forms during this phase. The dense mass of the mountain, obliquely stretching away into depth, and the coulisses on either side of the front edge of the painting are reminiscent of compositional schemes used by the generation of his teachers, but the spatial clarity is new, as are the strong colours, the energy of the brushwork, and the way he unifies the close view of a nearly overwhelming wealth of detail with the most distant parts of the landscape into a consistent whole. The impact of the broad prospect is as intense as the vegetation seen close up.

When did Gerard Seghers conform to the ideas of the ` Tenebrosi '?,"In his years in Italy, Gerard Seghers conformed to the ideas of the 'Tenebrosi'. After his return to Antwerp he could take full advantage of the fashionable interest in Caravaggist painting, which had become an international phenomenon. He became celebrated for his monumental half-length genre scenes. But he was highly regarded in the 1620s for his large religious and allegorical pictures, conceived in a genre style, and mostly done in landscape format. These paintings, such as the Denial of St Peter, contain scenes with numerous characters, depicted with lively poses and facial expressions, grouped compactly together against an undefined background; they are painted half-length or are cut off by the edge of the painting. The concealed candlelight casts a flickering and sharply contrasting gleam on the multi-coloured, theatrical clothing of the figures creating a powerful dramatic effect.These Caravaggist group compositions differ only in subject from contemporary secular genre paintings and just like them are ultimately derived from the compositions of Caravaggio's pupil Bartolomeo Manfredi. There is also a strong relationship with the style of Gerrit van Honthorst of Utrecht, who must have known Seghers in Rome",in his years in Italy

What is rooted in the medieval era?,"The portrait of the Officers of the St George Civic Guard is the first major group portrait by Frans Hals, and the first monumental civic guard painting in the new era of Dutch painting. Together with the leaders of public, charitable and professional associations, the civic guard societies were the main patrons to commission group portraits. This patronage took on considerable proportions in the course of the century. These group portraits are also of value as historical documents, for which lists were drawn up giving the names of the figures portrayed.

What had been considered two separate works intended as companion pieces?,"In the inventory of Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's paintings compiled by Giovanni Battista Agucchi in 1603, a double-sided picture is mentioned, with a Nativity on one side and a Madonna on the other. In 1638 the painting was left by Ippolito Aldobrandini to his only niece Olimpia, who had married for a second time to Camillo Pamphilj senior. In a list of the same property made prior to 1665, the work is recorded as still being in one piece, ""with gilded frame at the front of the Parmigianino [and] with a pedestal covered with crimson velvet and gold trimming."" The work was obviously held in high regard, and probably intended, from the outset, for use as a small altar for private devotion.The votive picture was still in this state in 1709 and only subsequently split into two separate parts. Before this investigation of the archives was carried out, the two pictures had been considered two separate works intended as companion pieces. Curiously, in 1603 Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini's collection contained another small Nativity surrounded by angels, also by Parmigianino but not the same as the one here.This delightful example of sacred painting with its curved and supple lines, in which the Madonna with her hands joined in moving and gentle spirituality and the Child with a dove perched on an open book, undoubtedly inspired by Correggio, are set against a background of trees stirred by a light breeze, probably dates from around 1525.

It shows mythological scenes of unhappy love relationships, partly covering those 'vanitates' which are of lower order - a tambourine, lute, sabre, coat of mail and painter's palette, to name but a few. The statue of a mourning female figure in one of the niches bears great resemblance to the woman whose contours can be seen in Nicolas Poussin's famous self-portrait  at the Louvre. She can be regarded as a late successor to the weeping women who surround the altar tomb of Philip the Bold in Dijon.Pieter Boel's painting contains all the features normally associated with baroque solemnity, i.e. pomp and splendour even where power and wealth have become subject to the darkness of death. However, although all earthly possessions and authority are marked as vain, the dialectic of the painting never leaves any doubt that their real substance remains undisputed in this world and that the earthly order is preserved intact",the half-ruined church

When did artists absorb the new artistic ideas?,"This work illustrate the influence exerted in the Low Countries by the Italian Renaissance. A variety of artists made the journey to Italy in the 16th century, where they absorbed the new artistic ideas.

What were essential?,"Thanks to his organisational capacities, Rubens could meet demand and revolutionise the problem of large-scale pictorial decoration. His renown extended well beyond the frontiers of his country, and in 1621 Marie de MÈdicis, widow of Henri IV of France and mother of the reigning king Louis XIII, invited him to Paris. She wished him to decorate one of the galleries of the newly built Palais de Luxembourg with 24 monumental paintings commemorating episodes in the lives of herself and her renowned husband. The creation of a cycle of tapestries had, in a sense, been Rubens' technical apprenticeship for this demanding task, the composition of a cycle of vast narrative paintings dedicated to a living queen who had already entered history.Giving epic treatment to this biographical subject, Rubens was also able to give free rein to his fertile invention. He prepared two series of oil sketches, with detailed figures drawn in, which it then fell to his assistants to scale up to the dimensions of the canvases commissioned. These were then meticulously retouched by the master so that they might be ultimately be described, at least in the final layers of paint, as his own works. The entire commission was completed in only three years.All of his prodigious culture was drawn on for these works: his encyclopaedic knowledge of classical mythology was exploited to the full in transforming the queen's entire career - Henri slipped rather into the background - into a kind of operatic sequence largely of Rubens' own invention. Metamorphosing life into myth, he freely mingled historical personages with the gods of Olympus, who came to represent them. The scheme of this apparatus was invented as he went along, the - often gratuitous - interpolations of the divine gracefully leavening the uneventful royal life. It had required all of Rubens' imaginative resources and natural verve to ennoble and illustrate the relatively colourless circumstances of the Queen Mother's life. These qualities were essential; Rubens' international renown depended on his success in this formidable commission. His solution was to populate his compositions with nude goddesses, pagan gods, curvaceous undines, mischievous tritons, and genii unspecified. His customary contrasts are at work in the playful opposition of gleaming cuirasses and lusty bodies, fragile silks and the rugged hulls of dreadnoughts. The poverty of his subject was utterly transcended; this is pure painting, nothing but painting.Certainly, it was not the rather heavy features of the Medici family, particularly evident in the queen, that had attracted Henri IV, but the scale of her dowry. Rubens nevertheless contrived to render her portrait agreeable. He disguised her now as an attractive Bellona, now as a proud horsewoman in The Capture of Juliers. The royal couple become Olympian deities in The Meeting of Marie de MÈdicis and Henri IV at Lyon, while The Fate Spinning Marie's Destiny and The Triumph of Truth became pretexts for a proliferation of female convexity",these qualities

The picture in Ottawa is probably that mentioned in 1545 in a letter from Pietro Aretino, which once belonged to the portrait collection of Paolo Giovio in Como. With the body turned slightly to the right and the grave, spiritual face framed by the beard and hair, Daniele Barbaro's gaze is fixed on the viewer.

Who also painted his portrait?,"While Pope Pius VII remained in Paris after the consecration, David also painted his portrait and thereby joined an illustrious band of past artists - Raphael, Titian and Vel·zquez - as the painter of a pontiff. David broke with protocol by sitting down while he worked, as previously tradition had dictated that the humble artist should kneel to paint the Pope. David, though, did appreciate the honour bestowed upon him and apparently put on fine clothes and wore a sword as he worked. He responded warmly to the venerable old pontiff and was both delighted and moved by the benediction that he received from the hand of Pius",David

What is music and lovemaking?,"Cranach's painting is about the human yearning for immortality and eternal youth. Human beings dream of being young again, of leaving the worn outer shell and exchanging it for a new one. The notion of the cleansing power of the elements, especially of water, is as old as humankind itself. The centre of the scene is a pool filled with water. Some steps lead down to the pool, which is surrounded by a fantastic landscape far from civilisation. People have undertaken arduous journeys to reach this solitary spot and bathe in the miraculous waters.In the left half of the picture wrinkled and frail old women are brought up on carts and stretchers. They are undressed and examined by a doctor before stepping into the water where the gradual process of rejuvenation takes place. Their wrinkles and old sallow skin disappear, their flesh becomes rosy and smooth, and they turn into young girls. As they emerge from the water they are welcomed by a cavalier who shows them to a tent where they receive new clothes. Old peasant women are transformed into young ladies of the court who indulge in the carefree pleasures of life. The jollifications at the festive table, the dancing, music and lovemaking, all take place in a lush flowering landscape. These are the realms of eternal youth, to which the hardships of old age, set in a barren rocky landscape on the left side of the picture, form a stark contrast.The fountain spouting water from the spring into the pool bears the statues of Venus and Cupid - evidence that this is actually a fountain of love rather than youth, and that the power of love is the true source of immortality",the dancing

These are the realms of eternal youth, to which the hardships of old age, set in a barren rocky landscape on the left side of the picture, form a stark contrast.The fountain spouting water from the spring into the pool bears the statues of Venus and Cupid - evidence that this is actually a fountain of love rather than youth, and that the power of love is the true source of immortality",the pool

Who did Roman circles thus become?,"The Sacchetti family commissioned this painting in the 1620s when Pietro da Cortona was just making his name in Roman circles. They thus became his first patrons and introduced him to the world of aristocratic commissions. During the first two decades of the century, Caravaggio's naturalistic style had been rivaled by the Carracci cousins' academic style of classicism. Each school had its own followers and some attempts had been made to bring the two together. The arrival of Pietro da Cortona, at the same time as Bernini erupted onto the scene as the preferred sculptor and architect of the Barberini pope Urban VIII, were together sufficient to transform art in Rome and to create a true Baroque style.Pietro da Cortona's painting stands out for its open theatricality, lively gestures, richness of colour, and brushwork, as well as its diffused light. The Sabine women being lifted into the air deliberately derive from Bernini's works, such as Apollo and Daphne, as if to underline the bond between the two artists.

"How many tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized present a truthful picture of the actual, identifiable sarcophagi as they can still be seen in the Portuguese-Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk on the Amstel River near Amsterdam?","Ruins sometimes play a prominent role, and gloomy skies set a melancholy mood. Ruisdael's rare ability to create a compelling and tragic mood in nature is best seen in his famous Jewish Cemetery at Dresden. A larger, more elaborate autograph version is at the Detroit Institute of Arts. These works are moralizing landscapes that were painted with a deliberate allegorical programme. The combination of their conspicuous tombs, ruins, large dead beech trees, broken trunks, and rushing streams alludes to the familiar themes of transience and the vanity of life and the ultimate futility of human endeavour, while the burst of light that breaks through the ravening clouds in each painting, their rainbows and the luxuriant growth that contrasts with the dead trees offer a promise of hope and renewed life.The masterliness of the Dresden painting lies in the artist's clear and concentrated presentation of these ideas. The eye focuses on the three tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized. They present a truthful picture of the actual, identifiable sarcophagi as they can still be seen in the Portuguese-Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk on the Amstel River near Amsterdam. Ruisdael made carefully worked-up drawings of the tombs, one of which he used as a preparatory drawing for the paintings. But the landscape settings of the Dresden and Detroit paintings bear no resemblance whatsoever to the site at Ouderkerk. They are Ruisdael's inventions. The cemetery never had monumental ruins. Those seen in the Dresden version were transplants from the shattered remains of Egmond Castle near Alkmaar, a site about forty kilometres from Ouderkerk; they also are based on a preparatory drawing. The ruins seen in the Detroit painting are probably derived from the ruins of Egmond's old Abbey Church. A rushing stream does not bisect the actual burial ground. (Would anyone in his right mind place tombs near a vigorous stream which would wreak havoc with the tombstones and coffins beneath them when it flooded?) The stream was included as a traditional allusion to the passage of time. Most remarkable is the barren beech tree in the Dresden picture that gestures toward the three tombs and heavenwards. If ever a tree was capable of seducing a viewer to accept the pathetic fallacy of endowing natural forms with human feelings and emotions it is this dead beech.The iconographical programme of Ruisdael's two versions of the Jewish Cemetery leaves no doubt that they were intended as moralizing landscapes. He made no others that can be given a similar unmistakable reading. None of his other existing paintings include tombs; those done by his contemporaries are rare, and some of them are based on his depictions of the sarcophagi at Ouderkerk. However, Ruisdael made numerous pictures that include identifiable or imaginary ruins, dead and broken trees, rushing streams, rivers, and waterfalls. Were these motifs invariably intended by the artist as symbols of transience and the vanity of life, and does the handful of them that include rainbows allude to hope? It has been argued that this is indeed the case, and that these motifs not only offer the iconographical essence of Ruisdael's landscapes but offer the key to the meaning to seventeenth-century landscape painting. According to this interpretation they were intended as visual sermons to convey the biblical message that man lives in a transient world beset by sinful temptation, but may hope for salvation","the three tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized"

What is Anna baffled by Rembrandt's mistrust in?,"Catalogue number: Bredius 486.This painting dates from shortly after Rembrandt had set up as an independent artist in Leiden in 1625. The subject is taken from the Apocryphal Book of Tobit (Chapter II, vv, 11-14). Tobit was a wealthy, God-fearing Jew, strict in his observance of the Mosaic law, who had lost all his money and been blinded in an accident. To keep them from starving, his wife Anna took in sewing and washing. One day, hearing the bleating of a kid which Anna had been given to supplement her earnings, Tobit falsely accuses her of having stolen it. In return, she upbraids him for his self-righteousness which has brought them to their present plight (this is the scene represented in the picture). Later, however, the couple's fortunes are restored by their son, Tobias, who goes to find the money his father has lost and to marry a rich wife. On the way he meets the Angel Raphael, who instructs him when they come to a river to catch a large fish, the entrails of which are afterwards applied to Tobit's eyes to cure his blindness.In this work Rembrandt depicts the psychological tension between the two protagonists. The mood of the blind old Tobit suddenly becomes one of suspicion and despair when he wonders how his wife, Anna, has managed to lay hands on a kid. She in turn is baffled by his mistrust.The space depicted is confined but packed with domestic detail: onions hanging up by the window, a basket on the wall, cooking utensils on the shelves, part of Anna's sewing apparatus glimpsed between the two figures, and, in the foreground, Tobit's stick, his dog and a modest fire.Such meticulously painted still-life detail had been a characteristic of Netherlandish art since the fifteenth century. However, in contrast to so many examples of its use up to and including the seventeenth century, it appears here to be without ulterior symbolic meaning; the purpose is to give the maximum reality to the events of the story",in turn

Who did the artist never accept commissions to paint portraits; all the portraits painted featured members of his family?,"The artist never accepted commissions to paint portraits; all the portraits he painted featured members of his family. These representations, each of which is a pearl of intimate Realism, reach the soul of the model. Szinyei began to paint portraits of this wife on several occasions, but he was not always able to finish them, because his wife, in sharp contrast with Szinyei's contemplating character, was ever so busy that she had difficulty tolerating the modelling sessions. She set both for the famous ""Woman in Lilac Dress"" (1874) and for the ""Portrait in Shawl"". The latter portrait was not finished in 1880: the deep scarlet coloured velvet dress his wife is shown wearing was completed only around 1890, long after the couple's divorce in 1887. (In actual fact Szinyei's daughter was sitting as model.) The painting is dominated by the delicate and sensitive beauty of the model's face, radiating from the background of warm colours.

The latter portrait was not finished in 1880: the deep scarlet coloured velvet dress his wife is shown wearing was completed only around 1890, long after the couple's divorce in 1887. (In actual fact Szinyei's daughter was sitting as model.) The painting is dominated by the delicate and sensitive beauty of the model's face, radiating from the background of warm colours. In Szinye's pictures, the women are often shown wearing in their hair or on their hats colourful flowers, or as in the case of ""Portrait in Shawl"", laces and ribbons. We can almost be certain that he did not use them just to conform with the fashion of the age. These colourful patches were necessary to emphasize the beauty of the face and the fine rosiness of the skin, as well as to produce a definite separation from the dark background",the delicate and sensitive beauty
What is the painting dominated by?,"The artist never accepted commissions to paint portraits; all the portraits he painted featured members of his family.

Who carries a basket of eggs?,"This delightfully spontaneous panel depicts Lot and his two daughters fleeing from the destruction of Sodom. In the story from Genesis, two angels warn Lot that he should escape before God destroys the city for its sins. Lot is told that his family must not look back, otherwise they will be turned into pillars of salt.In D¸rer's panel, Lot leads the way, dressed in a warm fur-lined coat and a magnificent turban. He carries a basket of eggs and has a flask of wine slung over his shoulder on his stick. His two daughters follow several paces behind, one bearing a bundle on her head and the other with an elegant casket and a distaff and yarn. Far behind them, near the towering rocks, is Lot's wife, transformed into a brown pillar of salt. In the distance the town of Sodom explodes with brimstone and fire, huge columns of smoke belching up into the sky. Gomorrah, in the far distance, suffers a similar fate.This depiction of Lot's flight is not the main picture, but the reverse of a panel of the Virgin and Child. The two sides are quite different, not only in subject-matter but also in style. The Lot panel is painted in a loose, spontaneous manner, whereas the Virgin and Child is much more finely worked. However, D¸rer must have intended them to be seen together. The panel was painted for the Nuremberg merchant family of Haller, whose arms appear in the bottom left corner of the panel of the Virgin.Virgin and Child at a Window was long assumed to be the work of the Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini, because of its composition and colouring.

What did Saints write his dissertation on?,"In collaboration with his son Jorge Manuel in 1603-07, El Greco executed an extensive programme of pictures for the Hospital de la Caridad in Illescas: a Madonna of Charity, a Coronation of the Virgin, an Annunciation, and a Nativity. Under a separate contract a further picture was made, of St Ildefonso, who was particularly important for Toledo. The painting is in the side altar on the left of the main chapel of the church, balancing the Virgin of Charity. Its original place in the church is not known. The painting is not mentioned in the incomplete documentation for the decoration of the chapel, and if, as is probable, it was not painted at the same time, it cannot date much before June 1603, the date of the contract, and was more likely painted soon after the conclusion of litigation in August 1607. In its present position, it makes a grand pair to the Virgin of Charity, and is one of the most splendid of his 'portraits' of Saints.It is difficult, and perhaps not proper, to separate his portraits of Saints from his actual portraits. In both he employs all his means of spiritual or psychological expression. The legend is that Saint Ildefonso, the first Bishop of Toledo, presented an image of the Virgin of the Mantle to a foundation of his in Illescas. The Saint is portrayed before the same image, as he wrote his dissertation on the Purity of the Virgin. The state of inspiration is brilliantly expressed. There is an infinite distinction in expression between the hand poised with the pen in this 'portrait' and the similar motif in the portrait of his son.In his depiction of St Ildefonso, El Greco anticipated a Baroque motif, that of the learned churchman.

Who received baptism?,"Scene 4 of the Cecilia cycle in the Oratory of St Cecilia, painted by an unidentified collaborator of Francesco Francia, shows the angel, now visible to Valerian as well, placing wreath of flowers from paradise on the heads of the bride and groom. The angels offers to grant Valerian one wish, and Valerian asks that his brother Tiburtius might also convert to Christianity.

Who devised the scheme?,"For the decoration of the loggia, Raphael devised the scheme and provided the compositions for the narratives, while the actual work was delegated to the most senior assistants. Giulio Romano took charge of the figurative scenes with Gianfrancesco Penni collaborating on the preparation of the cartoons and Giovanni da Udine as overseer of the decorative areas. As part of the decorative scheme, there is a series of reliefs on the pilasters. The vignettes in three of the stuccoes depart from the prevalent use of ancient models to show actions not only taken from modern life but referring specifically to the work in progress at the site of the loggia",Raphael

What does the painting of Saint Onufri also show?,"Ribera studied in Francisco Ribalta's workshop in Valencia, but when still young he went to Naples, then under Spanish rule, where he worked for the rest of his life. He was called there as Lo Spagnoletto. He obtained most of his commissions from the Spanish Viceroy and his entourage, but he also completed a good many paintings for the churches of the city.The influence of Caravaggio was felt throughout southern Italy and there can be little doubt that Ribera was the artist with the strongest and most independent personality of all his followers. Ribera represented crude reality boldly and without embellishment. The construction of his pictures is monumental and he reveals a strong sense of drama, empahasized by means of strongly contrasting light and shade. The poor inhabitants of Naples and the peasants of southern Italy were his models, and he depicted them without flattery or idealization as enormous figures clothed in rags.

Who was the panel attributed to in 1966?,"The composition of this remarkably refined little painting is based on a lost small work by Memling, which is best reflected in the Virgin of the Metropolitan Museum, New York. Since the dimensions correspond, the work must have been done with a tracing or punch-cardboard based on the original. The version discussed here shows the image in the right direction. The Virgin is represented high above a landscape, more monumental than the prototype. She stands behind a wall over which a white cloth is draped with very heavy folds. This also differs from the model. The panel was incorrectly ascribed to Michel Sittow, and later attributed to Juan de Flandes in 1966. On account of the quality, the typical facial features and the vaporous green-grey landscape, this attribution cannot be doubted. The panel originated about the time of the Retablo Mayor of Palencia (c. 1510) and may have been the central panel of a small triptych described in the accounts of Palencia Cathedral as the 'tabla oratorio de tress pieÁas'. If so, it could have been a work in the style of Memling's Triptych of Benedetto Portinari (Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi), with a donor and a saint in front of a continuous landscape on the wings",to Juan de Flandes

What turn their attention toward the action in the foreground?,"The painting belongs to the series of four entitled Scenes from the Life of Joseph the Hebrew, now in the National Gallery, London. These works, together with others by Andrea del Sarto, Francesco Granacci, Bachiacca and Franciabigio, were intended for the decoration of the nuptial chamber of Francesco Borgherini and Margherita Acciaioli, who married in 1515. The group of fourteen paintings, broken up at the end of the 16th century, was contained within a wooden decoration made by Baccio d'Agnolo.In this panel the thesis proposed by Mannerism is fully elaborated: the painter is no longer to be bound by perspective, or by the necessity of presenting his subject in a rational, objective manner. He may use light and colour, chiaroscuro and proportion as he pleases; he may borrow from any source he chooses; the only obligation upon him is to create an interesting design, expressive of the ideas inherent in the subject, and the various parts need bear no relationship to each other. The colour must be evocative and beautiful in itself.This work, traditionally entitled Joseph in Egypt, depicts the most significant episodes of Joseph reuniting with his family of origin. The painting is divided into four distinct zones. In the left foreground Joseph presents his family, who he invited to move to Egypt, to the pharaoh; according to Vasari, the boy with dark cloak and brown tunic sitting on the first step of the stairs on which the figures are arranged, is a portrait of the young Bronzino. On the right, Joseph is seen sitting on a triumphal cart pulled by three putti; hoisting himself up with his left arm and clutching firmly onto a putto with the other, he bends toward a kneeling figure who is presenting him a petition or reading him a message; a fifth putto, wrapped in a piece of cloth blown by the wind, dominates the scene from the top of a column, appearing to mime the gesture of one of the two half-living statues represented in the top left and centre of the painting. A restless crowd, curious to see what is going on, throngs the adjacent space between the two buildings in the background. Other mysterious figures, resting against one of the large boulders that dominate the landscape, turn their attention toward the action in the foreground.The clothes, expressions and features of all these figures are inspired by northern European painting, as is the large castle and surrounding trees depicted in the background. On the unrailed staircase of the imposing cylindrical building to the right, Joseph takes one of his children by the hand; higher up, the other is greeted affectionately by his mother. Lastly, Joseph and his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, are portrayed inside the room at the top of the building, where Jacob, now old and near to death, imparts his paternal blessing.

The group of fourteen paintings, broken up at the end of the 16th century, was contained within a wooden decoration made by Baccio d'Agnolo.In this panel the thesis proposed by Mannerism is fully elaborated: the painter is no longer to be bound by perspective, or by the necessity of presenting his subject in a rational, objective manner. He may use light and colour, chiaroscuro and proportion as he pleases; he may borrow from any source he chooses; the only obligation upon him is to create an interesting design, expressive of the ideas inherent in the subject, and the various parts need bear no relationship to each other. The colour must be evocative and beautiful in itself.This work, traditionally entitled Joseph in Egypt, depicts the most significant episodes of Joseph reuniting with his family of origin. The painting is divided into four distinct zones. In the left foreground Joseph presents his family, who he invited to move to Egypt, to the pharaoh; according to Vasari, the boy with dark cloak and brown tunic sitting on the first step of the stairs on which the figures are arranged, is a portrait of the young Bronzino. On the right, Joseph is seen sitting on a triumphal cart pulled by three putti; hoisting himself up with his left arm and clutching firmly onto a putto with the other, he bends toward a kneeling figure who is presenting him a petition or reading him a message; a fifth putto, wrapped in a piece of cloth blown by the wind, dominates the scene from the top of a column, appearing to mime the gesture of one of the two half-living statues represented in the top left and centre of the painting. A restless crowd, curious to see what is going on, throngs the adjacent space between the two buildings in the background. Other mysterious figures, resting against one of the large boulders that dominate the landscape, turn their attention toward the action in the foreground.The clothes, expressions and features of all these figures are inspired by northern European painting, as is the large castle and surrounding trees depicted in the background. On the unrailed staircase of the imposing cylindrical building to the right, Joseph takes one of his children by the hand; higher up, the other is greeted affectionately by his mother. Lastly, Joseph and his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, are portrayed inside the room at the top of the building, where Jacob, now old and near to death, imparts his paternal blessing. The curious combination of all these elements confers to the painting an anomalous and intriguing quality",Jacob
What does Simon Vouet show signs of at the same time?,"This painting, formerly given to Pomarancio, has been reattributed to Simon Vouet. It may perhaps be identifiable with the Magdalene cited with an attribution to Sacchi in the 1648-49 inventory of the Palazzo Barberini at Monterotondo.The painting, which shows some stylistic and typological connections with the Vouet's David in Palazzo Bianco in Genoa, could date from the years (c. 1623-27) in which the French artist was in close contact with the Barberini, ending with his departure for France. Though the canvas is certainly rich in Caravaggesque qualities, Vouet is already showing himself as a full participant in the new classicism that was on the rise in the Roman art scene. At the same time he also shows signs of sympathy with the first fully baroque works that were being created in Rome.This painting poses interesting problems on account of its close compositional connections to the Magdalene by Guido Reni, dated to 1631-32 (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). The cut of the scene anticipates the composition that Vouet adopted for his Portrait of Gaucher de Chatillon (Louvre, Paris), carried out for the Palace of Cardinal Richelieu between 1633 and 1634. Dominated by the monumental figure of the Magdalene, the picture opens out to a luxuriant perspectival landscape view in the left background. Another highly interesting element is the close stylistic analogy between the Magdalene and Vouet's Allegory of Peace, that was also in the Barberini collection (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). As the Allegory has been attributed to an anonymous brother of the Cavalier Muti (a student of Vouet and Claude Mellan), the similarities between the two pictures lead to basic questions about the true authorship of this extraordinary painting",of sympathy with the first fully baroque works that were being created in Rome

What is the composition indebted to after Giulio Romano?,"The Triumph of Pan was one of several paintings commissioned from Poussin, in 1636 the leading French artist in Rome, by Cardinal Richelieu. They were intended for a room in his ch&#226;teau in Poitou which would also house mythological pictures by Mantegna, Perugino and Costa. Poussin must have been advised about the scale not only of the canvases but also of the figures, for although he never saw the Renaissance paintings his personages are much the same size as theirs. He must also have been told that the pictures were to be set above a high dado, divided by gilt caryatids, gold fleur-de-lys against a blue ground, and marine battles, all under a gilt ceiling.The Cabinet de la Chambre du Roy in Richelieu's ch&#226;teau celebrated the cardinal's 'gift' to Louis XIII of mastery of the seas. The room, with its 'Combat of Wealth and Art', as a contemporary panegyric puts it, and furnished in addition to paintings and panelling with porphyry vases and ancient busts, must have presented a formidable challenge to Poussin. Not only would he be competing with some of the foremost Italian Renaissance artists, his pictures also had to contend with the glittering dÈcor - hence the colours here are among the most brilliant he ever lavished on a painting. Sadly, the room was dismantled long ago and the pictures dispersed, so we can judge the full effect only in our mind's eye.Poussin carefully allowed for the spectator's point of view. Nimble visitors to the Gallery can sit on the floor to look at this picture in order better to appreciate its spatial construction, and thus its full significance. The revellers occupy a raised stage extending back to where rocks and vine-hung trees screen off the backdrop of sky and distant mountains. Propped up vertically against this earthen stage are a timbrel and two masks - an ancient satyr mask and a modern Italian Columbine. Behind them a Punchinello mask joins a still life drawn from the imagery of ancient bacchanals: thyrsoi - staffs wreathed with ivy and surmounted by pine cones - the crooked stick and pipes of Pan, wine in a metal bowl or crater, and a Greek wine jar showing the god Dionysus, the Roman Bacchus.The composition is indebted to an engraving after Giulio Romano, a pupil of Raphael, but Poussin also demonstrates his first-hand access to antiquarian lore. The mixture of modern and ancient masks, and the stage-like construction, allude to the origins of theatre in bacchic rites. The main scene represents the 'triumph' or worship of the armless bust of a horned deity mounted on a pillar, his face smeared red with the juice of boiled ivy stems. This is the 'term' of Pan, Arcadian god of shepherds and herdsmen, and Priapus, a phallic god of fertility, protector of gardens, whose cult was imported into Greece from the Near East. Confused with each other, both were associated with Dionysus/Bacchus: Dionysus, god of the grape-vine, who died, descended into Hades then rose again was himself identified with seasonal decay and rebirth. All the participants are members of his entourage (as we find them in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne): nymphs and their lewd playmates the satyrs; maenads who rend deer limb from limb or strew flowers from the winnowing basket sacred to Dionysus.

The elderly Jacob, who reached the age of 130, took his family to Egypt to see his son Joseph, viceroy to the pharaoh, for the last time in his life. He had sent another son, Judah, to announce the family's arrival. Joseph prepared his chariot at once and set off to meet Jacob in Goshen.

He had sent another son, Judah, to announce the family's arrival. Joseph prepared his chariot at once and set off to meet Jacob in Goshen.

What did the Fleming Daniel Seghers particularly enjoy in a wall in brown hues?,"Religious flower still-lifes are a special category, first developed by the Fleming Daniel Seghers, a pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder. While Dutch paintings of flowers, particularly tulips, clearly showed a tendency towards secularization (with noticeable emphasis on the economic and aesthetic value of flowers rather than their religious significance, Seghers tried to recover their spiritual symbolism, in accordance with the counter-reformational aims the Jesuit order.Apart from the Virgin Mary, Seghers and his pupils had a preference for Eucharistic motifs. They particularly enjoyed painting arrangements of garlands around a niche in a wall in brown hues, showing a communion chalice with a host suspended above it. The host has a mysterious luminescent quality which emphasized the process of transubtantiation (the changing of bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus). This subject was painted especially frequently by Jan Davidsz. de Heem, who was born in Utrecht but spent a considerable amount of time in Antwerp.Like Seghers, de Heem succeeded in adding a phosphorescent luminosity to his garlands, which also have an enamel-like clarity about them and richly colourful nuances.

Banished for her shameful state, Callisto was transformed into a bear by Jupiter's jealous wife Juno, but was later immortalised by him as the constellation of the Great Bear.Hoet's refined technique is visible in his delicate style of painting and bears resemblance to the Leiden fijnschilders of the period. Although the size of the Colnaghi-Bernheimer painting is relatively small, Hoet manages to create a lively interaction between the figures and their setting and the composition is supplemented by Italianate architectural ruins which are visible in the background",Callisto
Whose shameful state was Callisto banished for?,"The mythological subject of this painting is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Diana's nymphs were expected to be as chaste as the goddess herself.

In Diana and Callisto, the unfortunate Callisto is shown being stripped by her companions at the command of the chaste goddess Diana to reveal her pregnancy.

What is the horizon closed off by?,"The most famous work of Jan van Eyck is a huge Ghent Altarpiece with many scenes in the city of Ghent. It is said to have been begun by Jan's elder brother Hubert, of whom little is known, and was completed by Jan in 1432. On the frame a quatrain is inscribed which states that the polyptych was begun by Pictor Hubertus Eyck, and finished by his brother Jan, at the request of Jodocus Vijd, deputy burgomaster of Ghent, warden of the church of St John, and of his wife, Elisabeth Borluut, who commissioned it. The verse was placed there when the altarpiece was installed on 6 May 1432.The stylistic analysis reveals that in the painting the work of two different hands can be clearly discerned. The overall conception of the altarpiece is the work of Hubert, along with the execution of certain parts, such as the panels in the lower tier. Here, the manner is archaic, and reflects the continuing dominance of the international style that was practised by Broederlam. The composition is typically unoriginal: the landscape is still conceived as a distant background, with which the figures at the front have no organic relation, an effect that is reinforced by the bird's eye point of view.This polyptych is mystical, not to say esoteric, in intention, and is imbued throughout with both spiritual and intellectual signification. When opened, it represents the communion of saints, which is ""the new heaven and the new earth"", in the words of the Revelation of St John. Thus the central panel of the lower tier portrays the saints symbolizing the eight Beatitudes gathered round the altar where the sacrifice of the Lamb is taking place, at the centre of the heavenly garden which has sprung from His blood.To left and right, in the foreground, are two processions facing one another. One of these is made up of the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, and the other of figures from the New Testament. Some of them are kneeling, barefoot. Behind them is assembled the hierarchy of the Church - popes, deacons and bishops, wearing sumptuous jewelry and clothes in the bright red of martyrdom. In the background are two further groups, facing each other as if they had just emerged from the surrounding shrubbery. These are, on one side, the Confessors of the Faith, tightly packed together and almost all dressed in blue; and on the other side, the Virgin Martyrs, holding out palm fronds and wearing in their hair crowns of flowers of a kind traditionally worn by young girls at certain holy ceremonies. In the middle of the panel, around the altar where the Lamb spills forth his blood, angels kneel, holding the emblems of His Passion. Grace is symbolized by a radiant dove hovering in the sky, and eternal life is represented by a fountain in the foreground. A paradisiacal landscape runs across all five lower panels, uniting them in a single composition. It is strewn with plants from different countries and flowers of different seasons. The central panel is vibrant with green, while those to the sides are more arid and rocky. The horizon sits high in the frame and is closed off by groves of trees, behind which clusters of fairy-tale buildings can be made out, representing the heavenly Jerusalem.The community of saints also extends onto the side panels. Magnificently arrayed horsemen, representing the Soldiers of Christ, are followed by the Just Judges. Opposite them are the Holy Hermits who have renounced the world, and the Pilgrim Saints, who were favourite figures of identification throughout the Middle Ages. They are led by a giant of a man, St Christopher. Many later commentators have suggested that his great height would have reminded the contemporary viewer of Jodocus Vijd's brother, also called Christopher. In the middle of the upper tier is God Almighty, the Word, essence and origin of the universe. He is dressed in red and is crowned with a magnificent tiara. On his left is Mary and on his right, St John the Baptist. These central figures are surrounded by angels who are singing or playing instruments.

The composition is typically unoriginal: the landscape is still conceived as a distant background, with which the figures at the front have no organic relation, an effect that is reinforced by the bird's eye point of view.This polyptych is mystical, not to say esoteric, in intention, and is imbued throughout with both spiritual and intellectual signification. When opened, it represents the communion of saints, which is ""the new heaven and the new earth"", in the words of the Revelation of St John. Thus the central panel of the lower tier portrays the saints symbolizing the eight Beatitudes gathered round the altar where the sacrifice of the Lamb is taking place, at the centre of the heavenly garden which has sprung from His blood.To left and right, in the foreground, are two processions facing one another. One of these is made up of the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, and the other of figures from the New Testament. Some of them are kneeling, barefoot. Behind them is assembled the hierarchy of the Church - popes, deacons and bishops, wearing sumptuous jewelry and clothes in the bright red of martyrdom. In the background are two further groups, facing each other as if they had just emerged from the surrounding shrubbery. These are, on one side, the Confessors of the Faith, tightly packed together and almost all dressed in blue; and on the other side, the Virgin Martyrs, holding out palm fronds and wearing in their hair crowns of flowers of a kind traditionally worn by young girls at certain holy ceremonies. In the middle of the panel, around the altar where the Lamb spills forth his blood, angels kneel, holding the emblems of His Passion. Grace is symbolized by a radiant dove hovering in the sky, and eternal life is represented by a fountain in the foreground. A paradisiacal landscape runs across all five lower panels, uniting them in a single composition. It is strewn with plants from different countries and flowers of different seasons. The central panel is vibrant with green, while those to the sides are more arid and rocky. The horizon sits high in the frame and is closed off by groves of trees, behind which clusters of fairy-tale buildings can be made out, representing the heavenly Jerusalem.The community of saints also extends onto the side panels. Magnificently arrayed horsemen, representing the Soldiers of Christ, are followed by the Just Judges. Opposite them are the Holy Hermits who have renounced the world, and the Pilgrim Saints, who were favourite figures of identification throughout the Middle Ages. They are led by a giant of a man, St Christopher. Many later commentators have suggested that his great height would have reminded the contemporary viewer of Jodocus Vijd's brother, also called Christopher. In the middle of the upper tier is God Almighty, the Word, essence and origin of the universe. He is dressed in red and is crowned with a magnificent tiara. On his left is Mary and on his right, St John the Baptist. These central figures are surrounded by angels who are singing or playing instruments. At the far right and left of the composition respectively are the figures of Adam and Eve. They were painted by Jan Van Eyck, and are set into trompe-l'oeil niches. Light and shadow play delicately over their forms which stand out as though they had been sculpted in the round.",the Pilgrim Saints

Who was the painting decorated Simonelli's family chapel which painted by at the commission of Giacomo Simonelli?,"Painted by Lanfranco at the commission of Giacomo Simonelli, this painting decorated Simonelli's family chapel which was dedicated to Saint Ursula. In 1630 the church, Santa Marta in Vaticano, was destroyed to clear space for the construction of the Vatican's Palazzo del Governatorato. A date of 1622 was proposed for the picture on the basis of stylistic analogies with Lanfranco's Saint Margherita of Cortona, signed and dated by the artist in 1622 (Galleria Palatina, Palazzo Pitti, Florence). The Saint Ursula does not belong to the most refined and elegant phase of Lanfranco's career (1618-20), but rather to a slightly later phase of around 1622-24. This protobaroque period for Lanfranco is characterized by a more robust and vigorous style that is a prelude to the artist's full baroque work of 1624-25.In the same years Lanfranco also carried out another work for the Simonelli family at Santa Marta, an altarpiece similar in typology and style to the Saint Ursula.

What was the painting discovered that originally instead of the book there was?,"Before his arrival in Florence, Raphael had already had occasion to compose small-scale devotional icons of the Madonna and Child, linked to a taste for the versions created by Perugino.

When transferring to canvas at the end of the last century it was discovered that originally instead of the book there was a pomegranate in the hands of the Madonna.

What is the painting rooted in?,"Returning to Venice from Rome in 1546 Titian created a remarkable group portrait of the male members of the Vendramin. Here he domesticizes official work such as Bellini's votive portrait of Doge Agostino Barbarigo as well as frescoes he had seen in the papal apartments in Rome. While the painting has the look of an impromptu gathering, it is rooted  in prestigious models that betray political motives on the part of Titian and the Vendramin.Titian adapted elements such as the steps, massive altar and flickering candles from Raphael's Mass of Bolsena as a suitably impressive setting for the Vendramin family's adoration of a reliquary of a fragment of the True Cross. Although the relic was owned by the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, the Vendramin family was closely associated with it: one of their ancestors had donated the relic to the Scuola, and an Andrea Vendramin, namesake of Titian's patron, was famous for having rescued it when it fell into a canal. Titian suggests the intimacy of the family's relation to the relic by placing the current head of family (also named Andrea) in the centre of the composition, with one hand on the altar as he looks out of the picture, inviting the viewer's participation. At the left two other family members, dressed in senatorial red, pay their eloquent devotion to the relic, the middle-aged man reaching out as if to share his adoration with others. Titian records and contrasts the emotions of his subjects; the sober obedience of the adolescents at left and the innocent play of the children at right serve to underscore the maturity and depth of the adults' piety, as civic, as well as personal virtue.Titian is supposed to have said a painter only needed three colours: white, black and red.

Whose works are never mere copies of previous designs?,"This depiction by Lucas Cranach the Younger of the founders of the human race was part of a tradition in the Cranach workshop that spanned many decades.

But unlike D¸rer, Cranach was less interested in Antiquity and classical proportions, and operated rather within north Alpine traditions that were strongly influenced by Burgundian-Dutch forms.Cranach's fundamental principle of varying individual motifs is illustrated in his depictions of Adam and Eve.

Whose models were?,"The reputation of Moroni of Bergamo rests primarily on his numerous portraits although, like his master, Moretto da Brescia, he also painted altarpieces and religious compositions.

However, Padua never had a Podesta of this name and, since it is known that Jacopo Foscarini filled that office when the picture was painted, we can only assume that the inscription is inaccurate and that the portrait is indeed of Foscarini.

What is achieved with a fine brush?,"This small painting, which probably came from the collection of Charles I of England, is one of the earliest and best versions of an Old Testament subject inspired by the works of the painter Bonifazio de'Pitati.

What (depicts St Ambrose Baptising St Augustine? ),"Following the restoration of Spanish rule and Catholic worship in Antwerp in 1585, the city fathers ordered the crafts and guilds to reinstall their altars in the Cathedral. Among the first to respond were the Schoolmasters and the Soap-boilers, who shared an altar in the church. They contracted Frans Francken to paint a triptych showing Jesus among the Doctors. (The left wing depicts St Ambrose Baptising St Augustine, while the right wing the Miracle of the Flowing Oil.)The scenes plainly have most to do with the schoolmasters. The centre panel shows the episode from St Luke's Gospel in which the twelve-year-old Jesus debates theology with the Jewish scribes in the Temple at Jerusalem.

The Temple is represented by a Renaissance church interior with a menorah and the Ark of the Covenant in the background.The left wing shows Ambrose, the patron saint of Antwerp's schoolmasters, baptising St Augustine in the presence of a canon-scholaster and several council members from the Schoolmasters' Guild.

What is the sitter's expression?,"The biographer Giorgio Vasari, in his Life of Titian, describes a similar portrait which he says could easily have been mistaken for a Giorgione if Titian had not signed it. This portrait was erroneously identified by early critics as the portrait of Ariosto; it is perhaps a likeness of Titian's earliest patron, a member of the noble Barbarigo family. In his early period, Titian's portraits are strongly realistic. The painting in its gripping tonal palpability and attention to detail, such as the stitching in the satin, has much in common with Giorgione's late portraits. But Titian, somewhat competitively, carries Giorgione's realism a step further in the way the sleeve billows out and invades our space, extending the boundaries of Giorgionismo in a burst of hyperrealism.

What is perhaps a likeness of Titian's earliest patron?,"The biographer Giorgio Vasari, in his Life of Titian, describes a similar portrait which he says could easily have been mistaken for a Giorgione if Titian had not signed it. This portrait was erroneously identified by early critics as the portrait of Ariosto; it is perhaps a likeness of Titian's earliest patron, a member of the noble Barbarigo family. In his early period, Titian's portraits are strongly realistic. The painting in its gripping tonal palpability and attention to detail, such as the stitching in the satin, has much in common with Giorgione's late portraits. But Titian, somewhat competitively, carries Giorgione's realism a step further in the way the sleeve billows out and invades our space, extending the boundaries of Giorgionismo in a burst of hyperrealism.

What is a high priest receiving sacrificial lambs at in the center of the loggia with broad round arches and built on a cross-shaped ground plan?,"The narration of the story of Mary on the left wall of the chapel starts at the bottom at the entrance to the chapel with the Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple.In the centre of the loggia with broad round arches and built on a cross-shaped ground plan, a high priest is receiving sacrificial lambs at the altar where a fire is burning. As the old Joachim does not yet have any descendants, he is not allowed to take part in the sacrificial rite, and is sent away. Symmetrical groups of Florentine citizens frame this biblical scene, and in the group on the right, the artist has depicted himself and some members of his family.This episode follows the traditional lines of composition. Of significance here is the architecture, which the artist obviously felt was more important than the events. In the upper half of the painting it takes up more space than the figures, who occupy only the bottom part of the picture. The most important figures - and not only the biblical ones - are standing at the front edge of the picture. All the other scenes follow this basic principle.In the background, Ghirlandaio's depiction of the widely spaced loggia and its medallions is a direct quotation of the Spedale degli Innocenti, the foundling hospital in Florence designed by Brunelleschi. Interestingly enough, there is a repetition of this faÁade, constructed shortly after Ghirlandaio's frescoes were painted, that can be seen when leaving the church of Santa Maria Novella at the other end of the piazza by the Spedale di San Paolo (built 1489 -1498).Above the portraits are two palaces whose lines run parallel with those of the temple. Comparable buildings, with rusticated lower stories and open upper stories, largely characterize the appearance of Florence to this day. This was one way in which Ghirlandaio repeatedly brought the city into his paintings.Contemporaries of the artist and clients are present as spectators and witnesses of the expulsion of Joachim, and because of their fashionable clothing and shoes and their vain hairstyles they differ conspicuously from the biblical participants.

They could move freely in the king's presence, trying to amuse the naturally melancholic Philip IV with their caustic remarks. To judge by their salaries, their position in society was quite high.

What was Agnew?,"Signature: Signed on the right on the lower edge of the curtain.Provenance: Mentioned in 1676 as the property of Vermeer's widow and given by her as security to the baker van Buyten, together with Lady Writing a Letter with Her Maid (Beit Art Collection, Blessington, Ireland), for a debt of fl 617. Subsequent sale Amsterdam, 1696, no. 4: ""A young lady playing the guitar, very good, of the same; fl 70."" Collection 2d Viscount Palmerston; collection W. Cowper-Temple at Broadland, later Baron Mount-Temple, 1871; art gallery Thos. Agnew, London, 1888. Acquired by the Earl Iveagh, 1889.An old copy, canvas, 48,7 x 41,2 cm, is in the Museum of Art, Philadelphia. The only difference separating this copy from the Kenwood, London, version is the coiffure of the guitar player, whose style points toward c. 1700. It would be interesting to clean this painting and possibly ascertain, by X-rays, whether the original coiffure is still extant and was overpainted at a later date. Otherwise, both paintings are almost equal as far as pictorial quality is concerned.Together with the Lacemaker (Louvre, Paris), this painting constitutes one of the best achievements by Vermeer, and certainly a towering success in his late maturity. By now, the artist had attained the mastery of light and colours, together with complete freedom of expressing himself technically by means of looser brushstrokes that are no longer bound to specifics of texture or materials. The model is not drawn inward but looks to the outside world in full communication and radiance of her pleasure simply to make music. Never was Vermeer more able to liberate himself from all constraints and convey his artistic viewpoint in a more masterly manner.

When are the Florentine influences particularly notable considering that Callisto's city of Lodi was a center of Lombard painting?,"The painting, once attributed by Berenson to Piero, was originally a round panel. Traces of the former round edge are visible in the bottom corners, though the picture was later adapted to fit a rectangular frame. The panel is cryptically signed with the initials ""C P L F"", which was correctly understood to mean ""Calistus de Platea Laudendis fecit"". Dated to between the late 1530's and early 1540's, this picture shows the influence of Lombard and Leonardesque currents, which Callisto unites with references to the art of Raphael's Florentine period. The Florentine influences are particularly notable considering that Callisto's city of Lodi was a centre of Lombard painting at the time.",at the time

What did the view function primarily as?,"The division between quay and water and the human activity around the market stalls and gondolas make up the theme of this view of the Molo. The quay, which is provided with steps and jetties for mooring boats, creates a striking line in the composition running almost at a right angle to the lower edge of the image and leads the eye toward a vanishing point just below the middle of the painting. Depicted at the right is the column of Todaro beyond which the buildings along the Molo continue with the Library, the Zecca and the State Grain Storage Houses all the way to the Fonteghetto della Farina near the entrance of the Grand Canal. A market with simple stalls and awnings occupies the Fondaco del Grano. To the left of the entrance of the Grand Canal can be seen the Punta della Dogana and Santa Maria della Salute and in the distance, to the extreme left, the Redentore. The composition is closed off at this end by a fishing boat which counterbalances the column of Todaro. As several corrections by the painter, visible to the naked eye reveal, Guardi modified the strong perspective of the buildings at the right and moved the Salute closer to the centre of the composition.The view of the Molo in the direction of the entrance to the Grand Canal was a subject frequently depicted in Venetian vedute painting. Initially the view functioned primarily as a setting for festive entries in the Doges' Palace, such as in Luca Carlevaris's Reception of Cardinal Cesar d'Estrees (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Later the view of the Molo was usually shown without the Doges' Palace and without any kind of festivity.For this painting, Guardi undoubtedly drew inspiration from a work by Canaletto (c. 1740, private collection) which he may have known through a print by Antonio Visentini from 1742. Not only did Guardi rely on this for his composition, he also borrowed several details from Canaletto such as the little stalls on the Molo and the gondolas floating on the water. However, a comparison with this source makes it clear that Guardi, despite the strong perspectival arrangement of this composition, neither subjected the cityscape to a strict perspectival system nor strove for an exact, detailed rendering of the architecture. For the loosely, vigorously painted figures on the Molo, Guardi more likely found an example in the work of the Genoese painter, Alessandro Magnasco. Furthermore, Guardi's painting is not even half the size of the one by Canaletto.Guardi's small painting and its pendant, a view of the Piazzetta in the direction of San Giorgio Maggiore (also in the Galleria Franchetti, Venice), no longer satisfied the presumably more representative function of Canaletto's painting, but were purchased instead by an individual client who was as interested in the well-known Venetian cityscapes as in Guardi's painterly rendering of them.As with many of Francesco Guardi's paintings, the dating of this work is problematic. It no longer displays the strong stylistic dependence on Canaletto which is characteristic of his earliest cityscapes, nor the brown tonality of his work from the 1760s. The shimmering effects of light and colour, especially in the wall surfaces of the buildings, and the nervous treatment of the sky and the figures on the Molo are characteristic of Guardi's extremely individualistic, transparent style in the last two decades of his career. Therefore, dating this painting to the second half of the 1770s seems plausible",as a setting for festive entries in the Doges ' Palace

What follow the scheme used for representing the toilette of Venus?,"The composition of this painting is similar to that of another painting of the same subject by Sebastiano Ricci, now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin. Both painting follow the scheme used for representing the toilette of Venus. Bathsheba is identified only by the barely visible spying figure in the Budapest painting and by the figure of a maid approaching with a letter from King David.Apparently Ricci liked to use buildings with columns to close up the background, no doubt inspired by Veronese.

What is the pilgrim begging for alms in the right wing at the back connected with?,"The Master of the Holy Blood was a Bruges follower of Quentin Massys and he takes his name from a triptych in the Holy Blood Museum in Bruges, which formed the nucleus around which his oeuvre has been reconstructed. This triptych in the Groeninge Museum - displayed in the original frame - is one of his best surviving altarpieces.The main scene represents a Rest on the Flight into Egypt in which the seated Virgin with the Child on her lap is accompanied by St Catherine, who as Christ's bride receives the symbolic ring, and St Barbara who holds a peacock's feather in her hand. It is a rather exceptional combination of the biblical theme with that of the Virgo inter Virgines. There is an echo of Memling in both the general layout as a triptych and the composition of the main scene, which is remotely reminiscent of the St John altarpiece (Memlingmuseum, Bruges).In the middle ground of the rocky landscape three angels are picking figs (a `poetic' variant of the palm-tree miracle) and on the right walks Joseph, perhaps taking the figs to Mary, who indeed holds a fig in her left hand. The donors on the wings, protected respectively by St Joachim and St Judocus, were identified as Joachim Christiaens, orator of the deanery in Bruges (regularly mentioned between 1535 and 1552) and city councillor (in 1530, 1534, 1536 and 1544), and his second wife Jossine Lamsins.

On the left wing at the level of the founder's head is the Preaching of St John the Baptist, a scene connected with the patron saint of the former donor. Above this on the hill is the Annunciation to Joachim, which was added later. Behind St Catherine, on the far left next to the rocks, is her martyrdom with the wheel and the heavenly lightning. Behind St Barbara in front of the rocks is the shepherd with his flock who will betray Barbara's hideaway in the rocks to her father. He is shown talking to Barbara's father, while in the scene above Barbara is being threatened by her father in the cave. The pilgrim begging for alms in the right wing at the back is connected with the story of St Judocus.The exterior features an Annunciation in grisaille on a red marbled background.The triptych, which dates from around 1520-25, is the first work by this anonymous master to be found in which donor figures appear, and since it is clearly of Bruges origin, there can be no more doubt about his being active in Bruges.Joachim Christiaens died in 1552 and Jossine Lamsins in 1557.

Who is on the far left next to the rocks?,"The Master of the Holy Blood was a Bruges follower of Quentin Massys and he takes his name from a triptych in the Holy Blood Museum in Bruges, which formed the nucleus around which his oeuvre has been reconstructed. This triptych in the Groeninge Museum - displayed in the original frame - is one of his best surviving altarpieces.The main scene represents a Rest on the Flight into Egypt in which the seated Virgin with the Child on her lap is accompanied by St Catherine, who as Christ's bride receives the symbolic ring, and St Barbara who holds a peacock's feather in her hand. It is a rather exceptional combination of the biblical theme with that of the Virgo inter Virgines. There is an echo of Memling in both the general layout as a triptych and the composition of the main scene, which is remotely reminiscent of the St John altarpiece (Memlingmuseum, Bruges).In the middle ground of the rocky landscape three angels are picking figs (a `poetic' variant of the palm-tree miracle) and on the right walks Joseph, perhaps taking the figs to Mary, who indeed holds a fig in her left hand. The donors on the wings, protected respectively by St Joachim and St Judocus, were identified as Joachim Christiaens, orator of the deanery in Bruges (regularly mentioned between 1535 and 1552) and city councillor (in 1530, 1534, 1536 and 1544), and his second wife Jossine Lamsins.

What was perhaps told best by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses?,"The mythological story of the contest between the goddess Athena (Minerva to the Romans) and the mortal woman Arachne was perhaps told best by the Roman poet Ovid in his Metamorphoses (Book VI). According to Ovid, Arachne lived in the country of Lydia (which had a legendary reputation for producing some of the most splendid textiles in the ancient world), where she matured into one of the finest weavers ever known. Arachne was in fact so adept at weaving that she became arrogant, and claimed that her ability rivaled that of the goddess Athena.  A contest was arranged, and having been bested by the mortal Arachne, the infuriated goddess cursed the girl, turning her into a spider in punishment for her effrontery.Strozzi's depiction of Arachne is part of a group of bust length depictions of female allegorical and historical figures and of saints that he began to create early on, perhaps in response to the visit to Genoa of Simon Vouet in 1620-22.

A contest was arranged, and having been bested by the mortal Arachne, the infuriated goddess cursed the girl, turning her into a spider in punishment for her effrontery.Strozzi's depiction of Arachne is part of a group of bust length depictions of female allegorical and historical figures and of saints that he began to create early on, perhaps in response to the visit to Genoa of Simon Vouet in 1620-22.

Whose portraits show a vigourous handling and a perceptive grasp of character?,"Leaving his poverty-stricken home at the age of 15, La Tour first entered the workshop of an etcher in Paris, then worked in the studio of the painter Jacques-Jean Spoede. With a letter of recommendation from an English ambassador he went to England where he was much impressed by van Dyck's art of portrayal.

After some experiments he soon came to excel at pastel portraits, surpassing all his rivals, even Peronneau, and gaining great favour at court. La Tour was most demanding in his art so that the execution of a work was often slow, and it was nine years before he produced a work which would admit him to the Academy.

What has frequently been explained in terms of their symbolising respectively the contemplative and active life of the hospital's monastic community?,"The symbolic gesture whereby Jesus places a wedding ring on the finger of St Catherine of Alexandria caused this altarpiece to be identified for many years as the Mystic marriage of St Catherine. Nevertheless, it is clearly dedicated to the Virgin and the two St Johns. Together with the Gdansk Last Judgment and the L¸beck Passion, this is one of the three biggest triptychs that Memling ever painted. The three altarpieces are also distributed evenly throughout his career, and hence serve as crucial milestones in the development of his oeuvre. The St John altarpiece is dated 1479, and is thus located precisely half-way between the Gdansk (1467) and L¸beck (1491) triptychs.The central panel focuses upon a Sacra Conversazione, a gathering of saints around the Virgin. However, the narrow vertical openings between the columns reveal a continuous landscape with ruins and buildings in which small episodes from the lives of the two male saints are enacted. The two wings each depict episodes from the lives of the standing figures of the two St Johns on either side of the Virgin. The left wing features the Beheading of St John the Baptist and the right wing St John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos. In addition to these realistic portrayals, the carved groups on the two capitals above each saint also depict key moments from their lives.The composition of the triptych as a whole is not only ingenious in narrative terms, with the different components interlocking spatially and thematically; it is also new in many respects as far as the portrayal of the Virgin Mary in heaven and the Apocalypse are concerned. The iconographical forebears of such a grouping of saints sitting and standing around an enthroned Virgin are few and far between. The only extant examples are, in fact, the Virgo inter Virgines from the circle of the Master of FlÈmalle in Washington and a similar composition, this time set in a room, by Rogier van der Weyden, several fragments of which have survive. They are not, however, comparable in formal terms. This clear monumental composition, with two symmetrical standing male saints and two sitting female saints, forming a tetramorph around the Virgin, must have seemed very new. As is the case with the architecture, Memling appears to have developed here upon Jan van Eyck's Virgin with Canon van der Paele. The Apocalypse is new too. There is no sign of any other representation prior to Memling in which the Book of Revelation is played out before St John's eyes in its entirety in a single, undivided painting. Only in the Beheading of StJohn the Baptist did Memling prefer to paraphrase a Van der Weyden composition (St John altarpiece, Berlin, Staatliche Museen). However, the stylised terseness and enclosed character of the latter give way here to dramatic action in the open air, with a high degree of realism.In view of the historical circumstances and iconography, there can be no doubt whatsoever that this triptych was painted for the High Altar of the chapel of St John's Hospital. An old inscription on the bottom member of the frame gives the date 1479 and the name of the artist Johannes Memling. With the exception of the Floreins triptych in the same hospital, this is the only work by Memling to be authenticated by an original (in this case subsequently overpainted) inscription. The donors were also identified. Jacob de Ceuninc was initially recorded as a monk at the hospital in 1469-70, and later as bursar from 1488 until his death in 1490. Antheunis Seghers was first mentioned in 1455-56 and appears to have been master from 1461 to 1465, bursar from 1466 to 1468, and then master again from 1469 until his death in 1475. Agnes Casembrood was first recorded in 1445-46, and subsequently appears as prioress from 1459 to 1463, and again from 1469 until her death in 1489. Clara van Hulsen makes her initial appearance in the records in 1427-1428, and died in 1479. Given that these are evidently intended as portraits, the altarpiece must have been ordered before the death of Antheunis Seghers in 1475, which means that its production may logically be linked with the expansion of the chapel's apse in 1473- 74 though we lack details of Jacob de Ceuninc and Clara van Hulsen in those years.The altarpiece is, of course, dedicated to the patron saints of St John's Hospital. The central portrayal of the Virgin might relate to the hospital chapel's long-standing and close links with the chapter of the almost adjacent Church of Our Lady. The two female saints, Catherine and Barbara, were frequently invoked in adversity. Their presence in the hospital context has frequently been explained in terms of their symbolising respectively the contemplative and active life of the hospital's monastic community",saints around the Virgin's presence in the hospital context

What is Springfield?,"Van Hoogstraten's most concentrated period of genre painting production occurred only during the last years of his career, around 1670&#151;71. These later pictures exhibit limited subject matter focusing primarily upon domestic themes.

In the Anaemic Lady a taciturn physician examines a flask containing the urine of an ailing young woman while another man (her husband?) looks on. This event takes place in a well-appointed house; the recession of space through two rooms in the background allows the viewer to scrutinize some very interesting paintings hanging on the walls and a sliver of a brilliantly illuminated gilt-leather wall-hanging.

What did ` the linea serpentina ' seem to italian aestheticians?,"The provenance of this picture is unknown. It is one of a series of paintings in various sizes, representing Venus or a female nude, turned out in quantities by Cranach and his studio; these were popular among the clientele of humanists for whom he worked. However, this conception of Venus belongs to a German tradition which derives its inspiration from Gothic art. The juvenile air, the slender forms, the tiny breasts an narrow hips, the rounded forehead, all go to make up the physical characteristics of the women (including the Virgins) represented in German art since the fourteenth century. This is quite unlike the conception of D¸rer's Eve (1504), which was based on an objective and scientific study of the proportions of the human body. The strange pirouetting movements of the legs, crossed over one another, occurs frequently in the engravings of Master E.S. As indicated in the romances and the books of sermons, a swaying walk was one of the ways of expressing worldly elegance for women of this Gothic world from the fourteenth century; but here this Gothic mannerism meets and contributes to another kind - the 'Mannerism' of art history. Mannerist painters and sculptors, whether Italian, German, or French, all admired what Italian aestheticians called 'la linea serpentina', which seemed to them the most beautiful of all forms.The Venus is clad only in a provocatively transparent veil; in some paintings this is a subsequent addition, but here it is original. The better to set off the ivory whiteness of her body, Cranach has shown it silhouetted against a sombre background of foliage. The landscape conveys in a few strokes an intense impression of the Germanic conception of nature.",the most beautiful of all forms

What is Love as the source of fertility and regeneration in nature?,"In 1516 Titian made contact with Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara for whom he was to work for a decade on pictures destined for the Alabaster Chamber. In this period he painted a series of magnificent paintings of Dionysian themes: the Worship of Venus in the Prado, The Andrians (Bacchanalia), also in the Prado, and Bacchus and Ariadne, in the National Gallery, London. In these paintings Titian combines a richness of colouristic expression with a great formal elegance. These are the elements which characterize this whole so-called ""classic"" phase of Titian's development and which is dominated by the supreme masterpiece of the Frari Assumption of the Virgin.The first painting in this series is The Worship of Venus, whose subject is Love as the source of fertility and regeneration in nature. Titian's composition is based on a description by the late antique writer Philostratus, in his 'Imagines', of a painting of cupids gathering apples in the presence of Venus amid a tree-girt landscape. By basing himself on Philostratus, Titian was in effect recreating a lost masterpiece of antiquity.

Who is the Alczar equipped by as a studio?,"""Las Meninas"" is a Portuguese word used to name the Maids of Honour of the Royal children in the 17th century.Las Meninas or The Royal Family is one of the great problem pictures in the history of art. An almost infinite number of interpretations have now been proposed for the scene it shows. At first sight, however, Las Meninas seems to present no problems at all, and indeed appears perfectly straightforward in its sober geometry and good-humoured clarity.It is set in a room in the Alc·zar, equipped by Vel·zquez as a studio, and shows the heiress to the throne, the Infanta Margarita, with her court. Palomino names all those present. The queen's maid of honour, Dona Maria Agustina Sarmiento, one of the meninas, is kneeling at the Infanta's feet, handing her a jug of water. The other maid of honour, Dona Isabel de Velasco stands behind the princess, and beside her we see the grotesquely misshapen female dwarf Mari-B·rbola and the male dwarf Nicolasico Pertusato; the latter, as Palomino points out, is placing his foot on the mastiff lying in front of the group to demonstrate the lethargic animal's good temper. Further back, almost swallowed up in the shadows, are a man described only as guardadamas - a guard or escort to the ladies - and the lady in waiting Do&#241;a Marcela de Ulloa.Vel·zquez is standing with brush and palette in front of a tall canvas; we can see only the back of it. There are some large pictures hanging on the back wall of the room. Two of them were painted by Vel·zquez's son-in-law, Mazo, from models by Rubens, and show scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses, one of them another version of the punishment of Arachne. The princess's parents, the king and queen, appear in a dark frame below these pictures, probably the glass of a mirror. To the right of the mirror, on a flight of steps leading up to a doorway and a brightly lit adjoining room, stands Jose Nieto, the queen's palace marshal.There are several basic questions that have been asked again and again about this picture. What is Vel·zquez painting on the front of the canvas that is hidden from us? Where did he stand in order to paint the scene and himself in it? What is the source of the image in the mirror - that is, just where in the room must the royal couple have been standing for their reflection to appear? And finally, is there any significance in the fact that the red cross of the Order of Santiago is prominently applied to the artist's clothing?It was long thought that Vel·zquez was creating a picture without any metaphysical or speculative reference, and was merely recording a fleeting moment in permanent form, as if in a snapshot. According to this theory the subject was no more than an ordinary scene of palace life.A different hypothesis is put forward by art historians, who believe that intellect and keen perspicacity, as well as the artist's eye and hand, were involved in the painting of Las Meninas. The largest number of interpretations have been put forward for the mirror on the back wall, sometimes also thought to be a painted canvas. Much learned industry has also been applied to the question of location: in which room in the palace is this scene taking place? Despite the riddles hidden in the painting of Las Meninas we must not overlook its artistic mastery, particularly as expressed in the figure of the Infanta Margarita surrounded by people of lesser birth. For it was on the princess that the dynastic hopes of the Spanish Habsburgs rested after the death of Prince Baltasar Carlos",by Velzquez

Later, in Rome, he was strongly influenced by the work of Michelangelo. By the time he had settled in Toledo around 1576, his art was fully developed. Like most of the painters coming from Italy, he was anxious to enter the service of King Philip II, but the Greek painter's immediacy of passion, ecstatic style, disturbing colours and visionary conceptions did not please the king's academic Italian taste.

Who did Raphael paint in the corners?,"The ceiling design is attributed to Sodoma, but he painted only the central octagon and the small spaces between the tondi.

Who was the husband?,"""Matthan begat Jacob. Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."" (Matthew 1:15-16)At the top of the entrance wall of the chapel, to the right of the viewer, next to the Eleazar-Matthan lunette, there is the one concluding the genealogical sequence of the ancestors of Christ in the Gospel of St Matthew.Sullen and perplexed, wrapped in a huge yellow ochre cloak and seemingly withdrawn, the old man - generally believed to be Jacob - dominates the family group on the left due to his expressive power and the quality of the colour. Similarly, on the right, the female figure, usually thought to be Mary, is more prominent than the other members of the Holy Family and the child holding a mirror. Behind Mary in the shadow, Joseph holds the Christ child, who stretches out an arm toward the round mirror held out at the height of his face by a naked female child, possibly an allegory of the Church.The compositional schemes of the two neighbouring lunettes correspond: in both there is a female figure in the foreground seen in full, or half, profile and facing the outer wall of the chapel, and a male figure, on the internal side, with his torso seen frontally.",Jacob begat Joseph

What arch built as the entrance to the Castel Nuovo in Naples in 1453?,"In Naples, a great part of the finest sculpture of the Quattrocento is Florentine export works by Donatello, Michelozzo, Antonio Rossellino and Benedetto da Maiano. The principal local sculptor is Francesco Laurana. His relief (shown on the picture) on the Triumphal Arch of Alfonso I, reveals him as charming, competent, and to a considerable extent heir to the tradition of Late Gothic realism.In 1453 a triumphal arch built as the entrance to the Castel Nuovo in Naples. This was intended to commemorate the temporary arch that had been erected in front of the cathedral when King Alfonso entered the city in triumph in 1443. Typifying Alfonso's dependence on Spanish staff, the Catalan master Pere Joan (active 1400-58) oversaw the project. Under his direction Pietro da Milano, a Lombard sculptor who had spent his early years working in Ragusa in Dalmatia, supervised the work of at least five master sculptors (including Francesco Laurana) and thirty-three assistants. Sculptural work was allocated to different workers, ensuring a speedy completion of the project.The attic story of this arch is decorated by a relief of The Triumphal Entry of Alfonso into Naples. In this relief, groups of figures, all carefully coordinated in size and scale, even though carved by different hands, enact an idealized and simplified version of Alfonso's triumphal entry into Naples a decade earlier. The sculptors evoke the character and decorum of early Roman imperial reliefs in the proud, calm bearing of nobles who process behind Alfonso, enthroned and elevated on a canopied processional cart, and in the more active figures of the musicians and horsemen who lead the way",a triumphal

What did sculptural work ensure a speedy completion of?,"In Naples, a great part of the finest sculpture of the Quattrocento is Florentine export works by Donatello, Michelozzo, Antonio Rossellino and Benedetto da Maiano. The principal local sculptor is Francesco Laurana. His relief (shown on the picture) on the Triumphal Arch of Alfonso I, reveals him as charming, competent, and to a considerable extent heir to the tradition of Late Gothic realism.In 1453 a triumphal arch built as the entrance to the Castel Nuovo in Naples. This was intended to commemorate the temporary arch that had been erected in front of the cathedral when King Alfonso entered the city in triumph in 1443. Typifying Alfonso's dependence on Spanish staff, the Catalan master Pere Joan (active 1400-58) oversaw the project. Under his direction Pietro da Milano, a Lombard sculptor who had spent his early years working in Ragusa in Dalmatia, supervised the work of at least five master sculptors (including Francesco Laurana) and thirty-three assistants. Sculptural work was allocated to different workers, ensuring a speedy completion of the project.The attic story of this arch is decorated by a relief of The Triumphal Entry of Alfonso into Naples. In this relief, groups of figures, all carefully coordinated in size and scale, even though carved by different hands, enact an idealized and simplified version of Alfonso's triumphal entry into Naples a decade earlier.

This painting stress a rock formation known as Aval or Aiouille, where a natural flying buttress appears to support an equally natural, crenellated tower. This sense of implicit architecture suggests a great city lost in primeval times",a striking contrast
What are scenes the pairing of?,"The painting is a portable triptych of a type that was fairly widely produced in Italy during the early fourteenth century, essentially for private worship. For the purposes of travel the wings would have closed inwards covering the centre panels and lying flush with the raised spandrel above the inner moulding. The backs of the wings were most probably painted with imitation marble or porphyry, perhaps with decorative motifs, as opposed to narrative scenes. The creation of a work of art of this kind was due to a combination of craftsmanship and painterly skills. Some of the finest surviving examples are Florentine or Sienese in origin. The triptych in the Royal Collection is comparable with examples in the National Gallery in London, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Pinacoteca in Siena, and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all of which, according to varying degrees of attribution, are associated with Duccio or his workshop.The exact attribution of the present triptych is unsettled owing to the multiplicity of hands at work not only in Duccio's workshop as a whole, but even on the surface of individual paintings. The centre panel in particular is of a quality worthy of Duccio himself. The same might almost be said of the lower scenes in each of the wings, certainly in their design even if the actual execution reveals evidence of assistants (for example, the gold decoration on the cloth of honour behind Christ and the Virgin Enthroned, lower right). The inconsistencies apparent in the architecture of Annunciation (top left) or the design of the two thrones are not unknown in Duccio's own work, as revealed in the Maest&#224; of 1308-11 (Siena, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo) with which this triptych is comparable in date or possibly slightly earlier.The iconography of the panels is also significant. Paradoxically, the inner religious consistency is derived from the unusual combination of scenes, especially the pairing of enthroned figures in the lower sections of the wings. The enthronement of the Virgin twice (lower left and lower right), for instance, suggests a temporal sequence before and after Christ's death as represented in the centre. The Annunciation (top left) is comparable with the relevant scene (now in the National Gallery, London) from the Maest&#224;, whereas both Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata (top right) and Christ and the Virgin Enthroned (lower right) recall frescoes in the Upper Church of St Francis, Assisi (the former in the nave from the Life of Saint Francis and the latter, earlier in date and by Cimabue, in the transept). These connotations and the treatment of the crucifixion in a devotional, as opposed to a narrative sense, imply a Franciscan origin for this triptych. The quantity of blood depicted in the central scene (some of it removed in an earlier restoration) is an unusual feature in a work on this scale.Probably before it became part of the Royal Collection the triptych had been dismantled and put in a heavy gothic frame, which was removed when it was cleaned in 1930. After this the triptych was displayed in a shadow box with a simpler frame.

He placed the Virgin and her Child-isolated from the other figures-into the central, widest part. The Virgin is riding the ass side-saddle, as though she were sitting on a throne, and she is turned towards us. To indicate the direction of her course, her body is a little bent backwards. The oblique line of her body suggests a straight line between the upper point of the frame and the bottom inward angle on the right, and this diagonal axis is further stressed by the ass's foreleg, stepping forwards, which, continuing the same line, eventually ends in the semicircle. A similar connection between the composition and the frame can be observed in the hindmost leg of the ass and the bottom left semicircle. The oblique line of the leg is a reflected image of the axis which was mentioned previously. The horizontal line of the animal's body links the figures of the Virgin and Joseph, and, at the same time, it separates the Holy Family from the women accompanying them. The palm branches in the hands of the woman in a green cloak, and the drapery falling downwards from her arm, practically creates a line between the top and the bottom angular indentations of the frame. (According to some apocryphal gospels the fleeing Holy Family was nourished by the fruits of a palm-tree bending towards them.) The background, too, separates the left-hand side of the picture from the rest: the escorts proceed among bare, grey rocks, while the Holy Family move through woods: the foliage magically illuminates the semi-darkness.Whilst the two female figures are moving forwards, Joseph, at the head of the small group, has stopped and looks back. By this the painting representing progress in one direction becomes enclosed and symmetrical. This geometrically constructed composition with its strict rhythm by Lorenzo Monaco shows, as do all his works, that even while pursuing the best trecento traditions of Florentine art, an artist could adjust himself to the International Gothic style.

The horizontal line of the animal's body links the figures of the Virgin and Joseph, and, at the same time, it separates the Holy Family from the women accompanying them. The palm branches in the hands of the woman in a green cloak, and the drapery falling downwards from her arm, practically creates a line between the top and the bottom angular indentations of the frame. (According to some apocryphal gospels the fleeing Holy Family was nourished by the fruits of a palm-tree bending towards them.) The background, too, separates the left-hand side of the picture from the rest: the escorts proceed among bare, grey rocks, while the Holy Family move through woods: the foliage magically illuminates the semi-darkness.Whilst the two female figures are moving forwards, Joseph, at the head of the small group, has stopped and looks back. By this the painting representing progress in one direction becomes enclosed and symmetrical. This geometrically constructed composition with its strict rhythm by Lorenzo Monaco shows, as do all his works, that even while pursuing the best trecento traditions of Florentine art, an artist could adjust himself to the International Gothic style. Counterparts of the two women, with the long, even and soft folds of their draperies, or of the Virgin's graceful, aristocratic figure, could be found anywhere in the art of the period. On the other hand, the vigorous and definite personality of Joseph can be imagined only in Florentine art, which had old, democratic traditions. In vain would we try to find this image in the representations of Joseph as the humble old man in Northern art",Florentine art
Whose body is pushed towards the picture plane like the St John?,"Orazio Gentileschi's brooding image of David contemplating the head of Goliath reflects a new type of meditative image introduced at the beginning of the seventeenth century by Caravaggio. Traditionally David was shown either as an uncompromised biblical hero slaying Goliath or as a triumphant youth displaying the giant's decapitated head. In Caravaggio's David with the Head of Goliath (Galleria Borghese, Rome), which was likely to have been sent from Naples around 1609 as a gift for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the adolescent hero gazes tenderly at his victim's head, creating a strong, almost erotic, bond. Orazio's David does not interact with Goliath's head, rather he stands beside it lost in a moment of deep introspection, evoking a pensive atmosphere similar to the mood generated in Caravaggio's St John the Baptist. Like the St John, David's body is pushed towards the picture plane and set off against a background of dense, dark foliage. This verdant background is strikingly different from the one in Orazio's small copper version (Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Berlin), in which David is framed by a rocky cliff. The difference has led some critics to suggest that Agostino Tassi was responsible for the landscape in the Spada picture, but there is no conclusive proof to substantiate this.Unlike the Berlin copper, where David is seen full-length, in the Spada version his body is cropped just below the knee and Goliath's head is turned upwards towards the viewer. It has been suggested that the Spada canvas was cut down at the bottom. However, technical evidence shows that instead it was extended on all four sides. Thus the picture would have focused more directly on the contemplative and melancholic David and the head of Goliath would have appeared to rest on the edge of the frame. A copy of the Berlin composition (Quadreria Arcivescovile, Milan) was paired with a version of Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith Beheading Holofernes , but there is no evidence to indicate that two pictures of such contrasting moods were originally conceived as pendants.",David's body

Who was the panel originally attributed to?,"This panel, originally attributed to Simone Martini, was discovered in Naples in 1904. As early as 1906 this attribution was already contested and the painting was reassigned to a variety of different painters in the circle of Martini; among them Naddo Ceccarelli, Lippo Memmi, and Donato Martini. At the same time, a number of art historians supported the attribution of the work to Simone Martini.More recently, scholars have agreed in assigning it to a close collaborator of Martini, an anonymous master who takes his eponym from this painting , which was formerly kept in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome (The Master of Palazzo Venezia). This panel was once the central element of a polyptych, to which a St Peter and Mary Magdalene at the National Gallery in London are also considered to have belonged.

Who is the woman listening to?,"The painting is signed and dated: Claude in. f.  Romae 1642.

The woman is seated on a rock and is listening to the shepherd playing the shawm. To the right of the picture is a tent supported by a tree, and on the left a stone bridge leads to a ruined Roman temple. In the background the open sea is half-obscured by the mist of a warm summer's day.The painter, whose real name was Claude GellÈe, was a native of Lorraine. When he first arrived in Rome, he worked as a pastrycook, then as assistant to the landscape painter Agostino Tassi, whom he helped with decorative work. Not much is known about his early career. It was only in his thirties that he began to acquire stature and reputation as an artist in his own right. The German painter-biographer Joachim von Sandrart, reporting on his visit to Rome (1629-35), writes that Claude was determined 'to become familiar with nature in all its forms, and would spend whole days and late into the night in the fields, so that he learned how to convey most naturally the flush of day, the rising and setting of the sun . . .'.Characteristic features of Claude's art are the subtle moods of the landscape and the variation in the seascape with the changing seasons. People are unimportant in his pictures; the painter regarded them only as a means of lending animation to his landscapes and as a rule he did not even paint them himself. In the 1630s he started a book which he gradually filled with pen-and-ink drawings of almost 200 of his own pictures; although it does not comprise his entire oeuvre, it is nevertheless a unique documentary record of his artistic creations. The book is preserved today in the British Museum under the title Liber Veritatis; in it the Berlin landscape features on p. 64, and according to a note written on the verso, the work was commissioned by a patron in Paris.This picture is recorded as having been in English private ownership in the early eighteenth century: until 1722 it was in the possession of the Duke of Portland, who sold it to the Earl of Scarbrough.

The German painter-biographer Joachim von Sandrart, reporting on his visit to Rome (1629-35), writes that Claude was determined 'to become familiar with nature in all its forms, and would spend whole days and late into the night in the fields, so that he learned how to convey most naturally the flush of day, the rising and setting of the sun . . .'.Characteristic features of Claude's art are the subtle moods of the landscape and the variation in the seascape with the changing seasons. People are unimportant in his pictures; the painter regarded them only as a means of lending animation to his landscapes and as a rule he did not even paint them himself. In the 1630s he started a book which he gradually filled with pen-and-ink drawings of almost 200 of his own pictures; although it does not comprise his entire oeuvre, it is nevertheless a unique documentary record of his artistic creations. The book is preserved today in the British Museum under the title Liber Veritatis; in it the Berlin landscape features on p. 64, and according to a note written on the verso, the work was commissioned by a patron in Paris.This picture is recorded as having been in English private ownership in the early eighteenth century: until 1722 it was in the possession of the Duke of Portland, who sold it to the Earl of Scarbrough. About 1818 it passed into the possession of Count PourtalËs and from him, in 1865, into the collection of the Marquis de la Ganay, from whom Bode bought it in 1881 for the Berlin Gallery",he

"What is St Jerome's thick, muscular right leg strikingly long in?","The painting was probably cut down slightly on the sides and top, painted originally for a local church at the same time that he was working on the frescoes in the Cathedral. It can be considered as the companion of the Nativity (The Night) in Dresden.Considered his masterpiece among the altarpieces, the composition is built up as a remote variation of the pyramidal arrangements favoured by Leonardo, broken by the dominating verticality of St Jerome on the left. The sacra conversazione is transformed into an informal and incidental narrative that takes place in a landscape. A makeshift red canopy has been constructed in the foreground, where his figures are massed on a compact, constricted plane. Their poses are particularly hard to reconstruct because they are either figures covered by draperies that effectively hide their structure, or are in intricate unnatural positions. As Correggio grew older, he began to take liberties with the conventions regarding the proportion of figures. Saint Jerome on the left, accompanied by his identifying lion, occupies almost the entire height of the painting, assuming a dominant role even in relation to the Madonna and Child. His thick, muscular right leg is strikingly long in comparison to his upper body and rather smallish head.The pictorial effects derive from a masterly application of the oil paint, confident and elegant colour, and idealized, refined faces",in comparison to his upper body and rather smallish head

Who do the grisailles depict the victory of over Satan?,"The closed altarpiece shows the donor and his wife kneeling in prayer, each before a niche containing respectively a statue of the Virgin and Child and St Michael battling with demons. Their escutcheons are mounted on the polygonal base of the niches. These were identified as belonging to the Florentines Angelo di Jacopo Tani (1415-1492) and Caterina di Francesco Tanagli (1446-1492). Tani was an agent of the Medici bank in Bruges in 1450, before becoming its manager in 1455. He was ousted by Tommaso Portinari in 1465. Tani married in Florence in 1466, and his wife bore a daughter (one of several) on 8 June 1471.

The coats-of-arms were originally reversed - in other words, the man's arms appeared in the woman's panel, and vice versa.Before departing for London in December 1467, Tani founded a chapel dedicated to St Michael at his employer's church in Fiesole and drew up his will. He probably also made funeral arrangements in the customary manner.

When did Danby remain at Paris and Geneva?,"After attending the drawing school of the Royal Dublin Society and spending a brief period in London, Danby settled around 1813 for two decades in Bristol, in whose environs he painted the small, exquisite landscapes on which his fame today largely rests. Forced to leave England in 1829 due to financial problems and a marital scandal, Danby established himself in Paris and Geneva, where he remained until 1840. His oils, ink drawings, and watercolours, focussing on lyrically romantic landscapes, represents one of the most significant contributions made by any artist to nineteenth-century British landscape painting. He also concerned himself with religious themes, treated in a visionary manner.The present painting is presumably one of four depicting scenes from the Apocalypse. In a Romantic nocturnal landscape evoking the infinity of the cosmos appears a vision of the giant angel described in Chapter 10 of the Apocalypse, descending in a cloud from heaven with a rainbow over his head and legs like columns of fire. The natural scene in which the visionary apparition is set evinces a coloration and sophisticated painterly handling that explain Danby's rank as one of the finest British landscapists of the nineteenth century",until 1840

When is the large number of Romanesque churches in and around the town only that the Italian period of Guy Franois has been reconstructed and his Italian pictures disentangled from the work of Carlo Saraceni?,"St Bruno was canonised in 1623, and so appeared frequently at that time in paintings from throughout southern Europe.Le Puy is the capital of the Haute Loire, part of a large upland area, the Massif central, in the southern central region of France. The large number of Romanesque churches in and around the town bear testimony to the fact that it flourished in the Middle ages. It was never an area noted for painting activity, and the return of Guy FranÁois from Rome to his native region was therefore to be of great significance in local terms, much more so than similar events in other centres where there was more than one painter active. Guy FranÁois was to work in isolation for more than thirty years, gradually diluting his art as memories of what he had learned in Rome faded. The pictures that he painted in France nearly all remain in and around Le Puy.It is only in recent years that the Italian period of Guy FranÁois has been reconstructed and his Italian pictures disentangled from the work of Carlo Saraceni. Saraceni, a difficult artist to define, was essentially eclectic, with an unusual skill in brushwork almost akin to that of a northerner. He assimilated many influences, ranging from Caravaggio to the German ERlsheimer.The picture by FranÁois that most shows the influence of Saraceni is the Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth, now in the MusÈe de l'Ain at Bourg-en-Bresse. Like much of FranÁois's work, it was intended as a large altarpiece. His altarpieces that survived in the Le Puy area, in the churches for which they were painted, are often surrounded by a provincial version of a sculptured and stuccoed framework in the Italian Baroque style. Although commonplace in Italy, such pictures in situ are rare in France; most seventeenth century altarpieces by the major painters are now in museums. The Holy Family altarpiece has the simplified forms sometimes found in works by Saraceni and also the strong lighting suitable for a prominent position in a church, where the picture would normally be seen from a distance.The strength of some of Guy FranÁois' compositions has led some authorities to suggest that he was influenced by Nicolas Tournier, but the most likely explanations for their superficial similarity are that both artists brought back from Italy similar Caravaggesque influences, and that both of them were forced to rely on what they had experienced and learned without renewed contact with their sources. Both painter had a predilection for monumental scale, although FranÁois never achieved Tournier's dramatic intensity.

He assimilated many influences, ranging from Caravaggio to the German ERlsheimer.The picture by FranÁois that most shows the influence of Saraceni is the Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth, now in the MusÈe de l'Ain at Bourg-en-Bresse. Like much of FranÁois's work, it was intended as a large altarpiece. His altarpieces that survived in the Le Puy area, in the churches for which they were painted, are often surrounded by a provincial version of a sculptured and stuccoed framework in the Italian Baroque style. Although commonplace in Italy, such pictures in situ are rare in France; most seventeenth century altarpieces by the major painters are now in museums. The Holy Family altarpiece has the simplified forms sometimes found in works by Saraceni and also the strong lighting suitable for a prominent position in a church, where the picture would normally be seen from a distance.The strength of some of Guy FranÁois' compositions has led some authorities to suggest that he was influenced by Nicolas Tournier, but the most likely explanations for their superficial similarity are that both artists brought back from Italy similar Caravaggesque influences, and that both of them were forced to rely on what they had experienced and learned without renewed contact with their sources.

Who draws aside a curtain above the seated apostle?,"In his second Epistle to the Corinthians, St Paul describes the revelations that were made to him. Liss portrays one of the apostle's visions, `how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter'. Above the seated apostle, who is surrounded by books, an angel draws aside a curtain; terrified, Paul shrinks back from the expanse of heaven revealed to him. Angels playing musical instruments gambol in the clouds, and in the distance the Trinity appears. The colours range from the deep violet of Paul's cloak through the green of the curtain to the most delicate yellow, blue and pink of the clouds. This painting with its extraordinary wealth of brilliant colour is one of the artist's finest works and seems to anticipate the Venetian painting of the eighteenth century.With the exception of Adam Elsheimer, Johann Liss was the most outstanding German painter of the seventeenth century. He was born in Schleswig-Holstein c. 1597, spent several years studying in the Netherlands, where he came into contact with the Haarlem painters, principally Goltzius and Buytewech, and with the Flemish followers of Caravaggio in Antwerp (Janssens, Jordaens). Liss then made his way to Italy via Paris. To begin with, he worked in Rome, where he was a member of the Netherlandish artists' colony, and exactly when he settled in Venice is not known. Until his early death, supposedly a victim of the plague which broke out in 1629, he continued to work in Venice and it was in these last years that he produced his best-known works, among them The Ecstasy of St Paul. Together with Domenico Feti, Liss played an important part in reviving the use of rich colours, a Venetian tradition which had ended with Tintoretto.In the seventeenth century this painting was in the famous collection of the Amsterdam merchant Gerrit Reynst (died 1658), which consisted mainly of works by Venetian masters and included a companion-piece, The Vision of St Peter, which was subsequently lost. Both pictures were engraved by Jeremias Falck and attributed to Johann Liss, but it seems certain that the St Peter picture was not the work of Liss but of Domenico Feti, who was a close friend of the German painter. It may be that after Feti's death (1623), his patron decided to commission Johann Liss to paint the companion-picture to the St Peter.

What is the central subject of the frescoes?,"The space of the room with a square plan (8,1 x 8,1 m) is essentially a cube, and in it Mantegna has created a monumental architectural reality by means of ribs on the ceiling connecting with pilasters on the walls, which are in turn supported by a marble socle. In the centre of the ceiling is the much-admired oculus, opening onto a painted sky. The interplay of levels of reality elaborates ideas already set forth in his art. Only the corbels are actually stone, the highly worked ribs, the garlands that encircle the eight busts of emperors supported by putti, and the ensembles in decorative lozenges are painted to simulate marble so convincingly that even the modern viewer is sometimes fooled. In the triangular spaces at the edges of the ceiling are twelve mythological scenes of Orpheus, Orion, and Hercules with backgrounds of simulated mosaics, a device that Raphael was to use in the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura. Only two of the walls have figurative narrations: the north wall with a scene that is usually called the Court and the west wall, divided into three scenes, Servants with Horse and Dogs, the Inscription with Putti, and the Meeting. The remaining two walls are painted with imitation leather draperies that encroach upon the other sides as well to create the fiction that there were curtains before all four walls and on two sides they had been opened up to reveal the events depicted.The central subject of the frescoes is Ludovico III Gonzaga, his wife, his children, and his court.

What do the Madonna and Christ Child appear in?,"The Madonna and Christ Child appear in a window, and the child is standing on the balustrade below it. She is holding a pomegranate that has been cut open out to him, and the boy has taken some of it, for he is showing Mary red pearls of fruit that he is holding in his clumsy child's hand. Mary appears melancholy, as if she knows about the future Passion of her son, symbolized by the pomegranate.This is one of the first Florentine panel paintings known today to have been produced with a paint medium containing oil for colour pigments. This technique first appeared in northern painting in the first half of the 15th century and rapidly spread there. Italian developed the technique later. The panel is very small by Italian standards, yet not at all an unusual format in Flemish painting. The Christ Child as well, with his fat, tummy overlong torso and skinny little arms, refutes the widespread generally more rounded Florentine type of depiction.This Madonna is modeled after one by Leonardo; in fact, the painting was formerly thought to be an early work by Leonardo",in a window

Who is a young couple who had been converted to Christianity?,"The painting depicts the appearance of an angel to Valerianus and Cecilia, a young couple who had been converted to Christianity. Cecilia had taken a vow of chastity and had persuaded her husband to do likewise. Valerianus had suspected her of secretly being in love with his f riend Tiburtius but the angelic apparition allays his doubts while also heralding their approaching martyrdom.The composition - showing the three sumptuously dressed saints as they express with dignity their astonishment over the apparition of the angel - incorporates the main elements of Gentileschi's art. It represents a high point of his maturity, ranking with the Madonna of the Rosei family and the Annunciation in Turin. The disciplined, orderly construction has a Neoclassical stamp that derives from the artist's Tuscan background. The handling of the light shows the fundamental influence of Caravaggio, while the refinement of the surfaces in the gleaming satin and damask draperies and the soft warmth of the velvets are inspired by Bronzino.Typical of Gentileschi are the arrested gestures standing out against the opaque shadow of the austere interior; the figure of Tibertius, silhouetted against the light as he cautiously peers at the angel; the system of curves formed by the wings, the body and the long palm branch of the angel in flight; and the outstretched arms of St. Cecilia and St. Valerianus. The structural elements of the composition are striking: the link between Tibertius' hand and the angel's foot; the alignment of the palm branch and the organ pipes, and the wreath of flowers, St. Cecilia's hand and St. Valerianus' knee; and the parallels formed by the figures of St. Valerianus and St. Cecilia, the organ pipes and the door frame, the keyboard and the dais.

What is the second of the three versions recorded by Baldinucci?,"Dolci was a painter of intense religiosity. His work was much sought after internationally during his own lifetime and his reputation reached its apogee during the eighteenth century, particularly in England.

As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.Dolci painted several versions of Salome. According to Baldinucci, the original version was painted, probably during the 1660s, for the Marchese Rinuccini in Florence and it proved to be the artists most popular work, known through two other variants of good quality (Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen and Glasgow, City Museum and Art Gallery), which in turn spawned numerous copies.

What is the Virgin mourns?,"Kneeling beneath the crosses of Calvary, the Virgin mourns her Son whose body lies before her. John supports the dead Christ's head, while Mary Magdalene, her long hair flowing, lifts one of His hands to her cheek. Behind John stands Joseph of Arimathaea with an anointing-vessel, and behind the Virgin rises the upright of the bare cross, stained with the blood of the crucified Saviour; on the tree next to it can be seen the bound foot of one of the thieves. Beyond is a rocky landscape with a castle on the edge of a lake.Apart from the Berlin panel, the theme of the Lamentation occurs in only one other painting by Baldung. The picture in the Landesmuseum at Innsbruck, which bears the date 1513 and is clearly an earlier work, is much more constricted, more angular and restless in its composition. In the Berlin painting the dramatic outburst of grief on the part of John and Mary Magdalene has given way to silent resignation. This simplification of the forms and softening of the outline is also apparent in two drawings on the same theme, a sketch in Basel for the Innsbruck painting, which bears the date 1513, and a drawing in a private collection, which is dated 1515. By studying as well two woodcuts on the same subject, the consistent development of Baldung's style from early apprenticeship to the full maturity of the Berlin Lamentation shows up in a telling manner.The artist, whose family came from Swabia, was born at Weyersheim near Strasbourg. At the age of 18 he began his apprenticeship in D¸rer's workshop in Nuremberg. It may have been the patricians of the imperial city who later obtained for him the commission for two altarpieces which he completed around 1507 for Halle Cathedral. One, representing the Adoration of the Magi, eventually found its way to the Berlin Gallery. While in Strasbourg, of which town he had become a burgher in 1509, he received the important commission for the high altar in Freiburg Cathedral, whereupon he moved to Freiburg and spent several years there, roughly between 1512 and 1517. It was only towards the end of the second decade, when he had completed this major work, that Baldung seems to have painted the Lamentation, in which one can detect traces of the imposing Freiburg style, a distinct departure from the late-Gothic resonances of the Innsbruck panel.Hardly anything is known about the origins of this picture.

Whose government decided to send Louis Philippe an ambassador extraordinary?,"The capture of Algiers in 1830 had given France the Sultan of Morocco as a neighbour. Louis Philippe's government decided to send him an ambassador extraordinary, the Comte de Mornay; the latter wished to take an official artist with him and chose Eugene Delacroix. The mission left Toulon on 11 January 1832, landed at Tangiers on the 25 January, travelled through a part of Morocco, and returned via Oran and Algiers.During his visit to this country, Delacroix witnessed spectacles belonging to a noble and primitive way of life which provided material for his art until he died; but he had not been allowed to enter the jealously guarded harems of the Moslems. It was the chief harbour engineer at Algiers who persuaded one of the port officials, a former reis or owner of privateers, to allow Delacroix into his own harem.In these few hours Delacroix did several watercolour sketches, some of which are in the Louvre. Using them as a basis, he painted a large picture on his return, and exhibited it in the 1834 salon. He wanted to show the dark tones of flesh and the subdued colours in the warm half-light of the harem.In 1849 he painted another smaller version of the same subject, now in the MusÈe de Montpellier. Here the colours are softer and the atmosphere more intimate; it has a note of nostalgia absent from the 1834 Salon picture, which is still full of his first impressions, and which already foreshadows Renoir. The latter artist was well aware of this relationship; in 1872 he painted a large picture inspired by Delacroix's canvas and called Les Parisiennes habillÈes en AlgÈriennes (Tokyo Museum). He had already done an Odalisque and exhibited it in the 1870 Salon. (Chester Dale Collection, New York.)",Louis Philippe's government

Who find themselves confronted with a startling heavenly vision including realistically depicted astronomical bodies- Earth and the sun hand directly above them?,"The picture shows the painting on the ceiling vault of the hall in the apartment of Anna Colonna in the north wing of the Palazzo Barberini. It represents the Triumph of Divina Sapientia.The Palazzo Barberini, residence of the papal family Barberini, set a new standard for Roman palace architecture and its painted decoration. Planning for the expansion of the sixteenth-century structure was first undertaken by Carlo Maderno, then transferred after his death to Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who here distinguished himself as an architect for the first time.The first commission for the painted decor was given to Andrea Sacchi who in 1629-30 painted the ceiling of the largest room in the wing occupied by Anna Colonna, Taddeo Barberini's wife. Sacchi painted here the fresco identified as Triumph of Divina Sapientia (divine wisdom). Sirens in the room corners hold up small sun disks that extend up into the fresco. They anticipate the theme of the ceiling, in which the sun plays a central role.The design of the ceiling omits architectural elements completely. Viewers find themselves confronted with a startling heavenly vision including, among other things, realistically depicted astronomical bodies - Earth and the sun hand directly above them. The personification of Divine Wisdom is seated on the Solomonic lion throne, crowned by two Barberini bees, before a huge radiating solar disk in yellow-gold. Imaginative cloud formations fill the greater part of the picture surface, creating a perspective pull that graphically suggests the vast distance between the smaller Earth at the bottom edge of the picture and the gigantic sun.It is obvious that Sacchi's ceiling presents a commentary on the then current issue of Galileo Galilei's heliocentric worldview",viewers

What is the model St John in?,"The Abegg Triptych was painted for an Italian gentleman, an unidentified member of the Villa family from Chieri in Piedmont, who were active in banking in the Netherlands. Their coat of arms appears in the glazed window in the left wing. The picture is generally regarded as a late work by one of Rogier's successors, perhaps not painted until the 1460s, though some of the figures of the Crucifixion were copied as early as 1447 by the Hamburg painter Hans Bornemann, who died in 1475. The costume of the donor and the findings from dendrochronological investigation allow us to date the picture to the middle of the 1440s. Compared to figures in works by Rogier's own hand the figures here, particularly in the Crucifixion, seem excessively emotional; instead of radiating dignified grief they are uttering loud cries of lamentation.Once again, the design of the triptych must have been by an assistant in Rogier's workshop. The figure of the red-robed St. John to the left of the Cross shows how he reworked the master's figural types to suit his own ideas. The model is St John in Rogier's Deposition (Prado, Madrid), and it is followed faithfully in such details as the right foot. The folds of the robe, however, are more strongly modeled.The cloak in particular, very dynamically draped and with a large fold flung backward over the shoulder, gives the figure a sense of agitation that is in tune with the character of this painting as a whole, but not with its model. Similarly, Mary Magdalene's cloak slipping down from her hips picks up a motif from the Deposition, but combines it with an extrovert gesture foreign to that picture, with the saint suddenly flinging up her arms.The series of the three panels follows a chronological sequence: the sculptural Annunciation group in the donor's loggia refers to Christ's becoming man; in the central panel Christ has just died, and the sun and moon turn dark as His companions break into loud lamentations; on the right Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, and a servant are approaching with a ladder to take the dead body down from the Cross",in Rogier's Deposition

The panel is almost square in shape. The scene is set in a totally enclosed room. The apostles are grouped around Mary's bed. The Virgin's fine blue robe contrast with the purple sheets that cover the bed. Her livid gray face is framed by the immaculate whiteness of her wimple, and of the cushion on which her head rests. Her hands are joined, her fingers look quite bony. Her eyes have lost their lustre. She looks up one last time towards the heavens, where her Son appears to her in His glory with arms outstretched, to display the wounds in his hands. He is dressed in a blue robe and a large red cloak held up by two angels. The picture represents the moment at which life has already gently slipped away, but death has not yet completed its work.The painter uses the apostles to ring the changes on the different varieties of grief, and their profound sadness contrasts with the detachment of the Virgin herself. Their clothes have been creased into countless shifting folds which cut across one another at right angles. Van der Goes is revealed as a penetrating analyst of religious feeling, of grief and devotion, and of the agitation they can cause. This work, like all those he painted during his last period, represents the eruption of sacred experience into a profane world. The artist achieves this through an abundant use of colours which strike the viewer as unreal, as if they were themselves transfigured. In this way, Van der Goes seeks to identify his painting with the mystery of transcendence itself.To this end too, the gestures of his figures are emphatic.

In this way, Van der Goes seeks to identify his painting with the mystery of transcendence itself.To this end too, the gestures of his figures are emphatic.

What did Van der paint is the Death of the Virgin the major painting of Van der very likely one of?,"The major painting of Van der Goes's third period (between around 1478 and 1482) and very likely one of the last works he painted is the Death of the Virgin. The panel is almost square in shape. The scene is set in a totally enclosed room. The apostles are grouped around Mary's bed. The Virgin's fine blue robe contrast with the purple sheets that cover the bed. Her livid gray face is framed by the immaculate whiteness of her wimple, and of the cushion on which her head rests. Her hands are joined, her fingers look quite bony. Her eyes have lost their lustre. She looks up one last time towards the heavens, where her Son appears to her in His glory with arms outstretched, to display the wounds in his hands. He is dressed in a blue robe and a large red cloak held up by two angels. The picture represents the moment at which life has already gently slipped away, but death has not yet completed its work.The painter uses the apostles to ring the changes on the different varieties of grief, and their profound sadness contrasts with the detachment of the Virgin herself. Their clothes have been creased into countless shifting folds which cut across one another at right angles. Van der Goes is revealed as a penetrating analyst of religious feeling, of grief and devotion, and of the agitation they can cause.

When begin on the left wall?,"The decoration of the Cremona Cathedral was begun in the semi-dome vault of the apse in 1506. Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the faÁade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the faÁade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht D¸rer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy D¸rer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.In the Meeting at the Golden Gate, the tender embrace of Joachim and Anna is united by the arch of the gate over their heads. On the left a series of portrait figures, perhaps the rulers and their entourage, occupies the pictorial space",1514

What are decorated with gilded braid and a ruff?,"During his trip to Italy and in particular when he was living in Genoa, Anthony van Dyck painted many portraits of members of patrician families. These were strongly influenced by those that Peter Paul Rubens had produced for the same families almost two decades earlier. From these Van Dyck borrowed the structures and the chromatic oppositions between the dark, court clothing and the bright ruffs, embroideries and jewels. The painting in the Brussels museum is a good example of this type of official representation.Porzia Imperiale and her daughter Maria Francesca belonged to a family of Genoese bankers. On 5 August 1610 the mother married Bartolomeo Imperiale, probably a distant cousin. Born in around 1586, she must have been between 35 and 40 when Anthony van Dyck stayed in Genoa. Maria Francesca's date of birth is not known, but the inscription Virtute gaudet (she rejoices in virtue) on the virginal, exalting the young girl's honour, shows that she was of marriageable age. Women occupied a special place in the Republic of Genoa. It is therefore not surprising to see them associated with Virtue, a quality with heroic connotations that is more generally ascribed to men.Porzia Imperiale, seated here, is dressed in a black gown, its severity softened by an imposing ruff, a double chain, engraved buttons and lace-edged cuffs. In her left hand she carries a closed fan, whilst her right hand rests on the arm of the chair. Her daughter wears a light-coloured gown with silvery reflections, decorated with gilded braid and a ruff, its moirÈ reflections very finely balancing the dark mass of her mother's gown. Porzia Imperiale's determined face contrasts with Maria Francesca's gentle and innocent looks. The background architectural details and the heavy red drapery confer a monumental aspect to the painting, further accentuated by the way in which the figures literally dominate the spectator, who views them from a low-angle position.

What was completed?,"Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo decorated with frescoes the family villa at Zianigo which his father, Giovanni Baptista Tiepolo had bought on his return from the task of decorating the Prince-Bishop's palace in W¸rzburg and which he had restored and altered to his own needs.

Almost all the frescoes in the small Zianigo villa were detached in 1906 and in 1936 they were moved to the Ca' Rezzonico and placed in small rooms, in a recomposition that closely repeats the original one, though with some differences and overlapping.The frescoes in the villa depict the stories of Pulcinella (also Punchinello, a classical character that originated in the Commedia dell'arte of the 17th century), scenes of villa life, games, the wars and affections of satyrs and fauns. It is a comprehensive cycle which Giovanni Domenico painted for himself in successive stages in the non-monumental rooms of the country house.

What is folded over?,"The tightly framed composition of this portrait makes it one of the most compact images ever painted by Memling. The solid head occupies virtually the entire width of the painting, with more than half of the shoulders and hands cut off the edge. The sensation of extreme proximity is exceptionally strong. The viewpoint is so low that the flat landscape, with a little church in the distance, can barely be discerned above the subject's shoulders, while his head stands out monumentally against the sky. The broadly drawn, wispy clouds appear to be a later addition. The man wears a dark jacket lined with white fur, flecked with brown, and an asymmetrical collar over a red waistcoat. The wider right lapel is folded over, and if fastened would reach high above its counterpart. A small crucifix set with pearls hangs from a golden chain, half beneath and half on top of the collar. The young man in London's National Gallery has a similar piece of jewellery, which he wears in the same way. It must have been a common ornament, because a version of it also appears in the Bruges Portrait of a young woman and in the allegorical figure of a girl in New York. The man's devotion is evidently directed towards a lost representation, probably of the Virgin and Child.When closed, this diptych would have displayed the coat-of-arms that is still to be found on the reverse. The man probably belonged to the Lespinette family (Franche-ComtÈ). Since its auction (as a work by Antonello da Messina) in 1894, the painting has been accepted as a Memling. It is generally compared with his portraits from the 1480s, and shows a particular similarity in its modelling to the Bruges Portrait of a young woman of 1480.It is understandable that some people should have been inclined to attribute this admirable portrait to Antonello, such is its precision and assurance of drawing and modelling of the face; but in the features, which are as though engraved, and the pointed steeple visible in the background, give a Flemish character of this picture",the wider right lapel

The wreath of openings still provides the principal viewing light.Michelangelo devised a long central area framed by a fictive marble cornice and separated into nine sections by broad pilaster strips bent across the ceiling, also in imitation white marble. Sections of alternating dimensions are framed between wider and narrower bands. Within them Michelangelo varied the size of the actual narratives, giving only the smaller ones a marble frame. Four ignudi (male nudes), among the most admired elements of the ceiling, ostensibly support ribbons attached to large medallions painted to look like bronze. Twenty in all, they are in different poses, producing, together with the Prophets and Sibyls, a ""handbook"" of alternatives for the seated figure for later artists.At the corners of the ceiling Michelangelo has painted four salvation subjects, including David and Goliath and Judith and Holofernes. Triangular-shaped compartments are repeated in a continuous band along the entire border of the ceiling; they contain bronze-colored nudes that alternate with the renowned Prophets and Sibyls set into marble thrones which, in turn, have paired marble putti in a variety of poses and positions that expand upon the tradition of Donatello and Luca della Robbia.

What is the scene related to the more modest little arches in?,"This small panel was only discovered relatively recently (1945) and so does not feature in most of the Memling literature. Nevertheless, it is an interesting little work which corresponds fully with Memling's style and spatial approach. The composition derives from Rogier van der Weyden. It portrays the episode in which Jerome removes the thorn from the lion's paw. The architectural setting is a characteristic Memling invention. The scene is viewed through a heavy round arch in brown stone, positioned at an angle close to the picture plane. It is related to the more modest little arches in the wings containing the Allegory of True Love. The fairly heavily dotted little trees in the background also recall that work.The odd way the image is cropped to the left and right is not the result of its having been narrowed at some stage, but is in fact deliberate. The angled position of the arch might indicate that this was once a left wing. The panel has been cut off at the top and bottom. Considering the size of the figure and the wooded landscape, it could be a side panel for the St Jerome in Basel",in the wings containing the Allegory of True Love

What was cut short by the accusations of May 1795 and arrest?,"When David was released from the Luxembourg prison at the end of December 1794, he became ill and so requested permission from the Convention to visit his wife's sister and her husband, Emilie and Pierre SÈriziat, at their country house in Saint Ouen, near Tournan-en-Brie, about 32 km (20 miles) east of Paris.

Who do domes lend well to being transformed into paintings of the sky?,"The decoration was executed by Pordenone and Bernardino Gatti.Domes, which vault the crossing and altar of countless churches, lend themselves well to being transformed into paintings of the sky. The round shape above our heads seems to  open onto a higher world, so that God and the things of heaven become visually present at the church holiest spot.Astonishing dynamic effects in dome decorations were achieved by Pordenone. In the large ribbed dome of Santa Madonna di Campagna in Piacenza, in 1530-32, Pordenone began to fresco a complex theological program. God the Father floats in the cupola, mysteriously illuminated by invisible windows. Putti, animals, and illusionistic reliefs of Old Testament stories decorate the ribs. In between them heroic sibyls, prophets, and other Old Testament figures are seen against views of the heavens.

Who was working on the painting of Christ among the Doctors at the same time as the Feast of the Rose Garlands?,"At the same time as the Feast of the Rose Garlands, D¸rer was working on the painting of Christ among the Doctors. The theme derives from the Gospel of St Luke (Luke 2, 41-52).On the bookmark at the bottom left of the panel, D¸rer has recorded that this picture was `the work of five days', a pointed reference to his inscription on The Altarpiece of the Rose Garlands, the work of five months. Christ among the Doctors is not only a smaller panel, but the brushwork is much more spontaneous and the paint is applied with broad and fluid strokes. Despite D¸rer's statement about five days, he based it on a number of careful studies, including one of Christ's gesticulating fingers. Although not present on the original painting, two early copies of the panel have the word `Romae' added to the inscription on the bookmark and this suggests that D¸rer visited Rome late in 1506. It may also be significant that the original painting was in Rome's Galleria Barberini until its acquisition by Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza in 1935.The story recorded in the panel is of Christ's visit to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, where he debated with the learned Jewish doctors (or scribes). According to the Bible, this was the first occasion on which Christ taught. D¸rer's daring composition does not use the conventional temple setting which he earlier used in the lower left panel of The Seven Sorrows of the Virgin. Instead he gives a close-up view of the faces of six doctors crowding round the young Jesus. The elderly doctors, caricatured faces which may well have been influenced by Leonardo da Vinci, argue with Christ by quoting from the Scriptures and gesticulating. Christ, a sober boy of 12, quietly gestures with his fingers to make a point.

What were depicted in intimate settings?,"GÈrard specialized in domestic genre scenes, often depicting an idealized vision of the lives of bourgeois and upper class women. Usually depicted in intimate settings, her subjects enjoy lives of leisure with their families or engage in elegant pastimes.

What is the high sky?,"The tonal style in Dutch landscape painting of the 1630s continued well into the 1640s, while still developing, especially in the hands of Jan van Goyen. The direction in which van Goyen took landscape reveals a considered logic; as tonal painting was a realistic attempt to capture an atmosphere, its consequence was, in the end, to paint the sky over the flat, low land. Thus, in his ""Windmill by a River"", the real subject is the moving skies.Everything is subordinated to the high sky, a sky that seems to take on the colour of the vast land stretching to a low, distant horizon: a brownish-green with tinges of blue. Only the sky contains more grey - the clouds - and is more transparent in its pictorial treatment. Dunes in the foreground, caught in a splash of sunlight, introduce the distance - suggesting a high viewpoint that gives the view naturalness. The windmill, painted in the greyish-brown colour of the sky, is a discreet spatial reference point",a sky that seems to take on the color of the vast land

Who appears?,"Cigoli's picture depicts one of the most dramatic moments in the Old Testament (Genesis 22: 1-14), where the Lord tests Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice his only son Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to slit Isaac's throat an angel miraculously appears and points to a ram, tangled in a thicket, that can be sacrificed instead. Cigoli shows the moment at which the angel intervenes, pulling back Abraham's arm as he points to the ram. According to Cigoli's nephew, Giovanni Battista Cardi, the picture was painted while his uncle was working for Cardinal Pompeo Arrigoni in Frascati just outside Rome. Cigoli, a Florentine, is documented in Rome between 1606-07, a date which accords well with the style of The Sacrifice of Isaac. There are several preparatory studies for the painting, one of which is on the verso of a drawing for Massimo Massimi's Ecce Homo of 1607, making it safe to assume that Cigoli was working on both pictures at the same time.Although The Sacrifice of Isaac was painted in Rome, the composition clearly recalls the Florentine tradition of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Andrea del Sarto. Isaac's sensuous nude body, however, reflects the artist's first-hand experience of classical sculpture. Despite the inherent suspense of the narrative, the picture itself lacks dramatic tension. Abraham's massive red tunic serves as a foil for Isaac's unblemished adolescent body, shifting the emphasis to the work's more lascivious characteristics. When the picture was criticised for its sexually evocative content by a visitor to Arrigoni's villa, the cardinal made an eloquent defence of the artist and the painting.

Where was Bossi closely associated with Carlo Borromeo?,"The identity of the sitter was only established in 1988, despite the fact that the portrait must record a prominent figure. He was identified with Francisco de Pisa (c. 1537-1616), Professor of Holy Scripture at Toledo University, the author of a major history of Toledo and a prominent figure in ecclesiastical affairs in the city. The identification rests on the striking resemblance between his features and those of a documented miniature of Francisco de Pisa in a private collection, that was, at one time, ascribed to El Greco himself.The open book displayed on the table is identified by lettering on its pages as BOSIUS CANONICI, presumably an edition or commentary on the corpus of canon law.

It was carefully copied, albeit in a different style, from Memling's Berlin Virgin Enthroned.

Whose figures became calmer and more respectable?,"The grotesque peasants carousing, brawling, or engaged in swinish gluttony in disorderly hovels are characteristic of Ostade's boisterous work of his early phase.

There is a new emphasis on local colour and an orderly arrangement. The reason for the shift in Ostade's mood has not been established.

What can be seen in the interior represented on the left side of the picture?,"The panel, painted on both sides, was part of the moving wing of a winged altarpiece.

In the interior represented on the left side of the picture another episode from the legend can be seen. Christ appears at night to Martin, who suddenly realizes that it was the Saviour himself who put him to the test in the guise of a beggar. He is then baptized.The building on the left, decorated with statues mounted on brackets, and the room into which we can look, show the distant influence of Netherlandish art. This building, a fantastic edifice of many storeys, is an imaginative feat on the part of the painter.

What thus reflects an increasing compartmentalization of the world?,"This piece, a characteristic product of the Rubens workshop, is one of the paintings in the series depicting the five senses. The allegorical content of these works was always obvious, and the pieces of the series did not become separated. The still-life details enumerating many traditional symbols were painted by Jan Brueghel.The amazing increase in the commercial and agricultural product range caused a complete restructuring of people's perception - a change which can be seen very clearly in the numerous paintings and series of paintings on the subject of the Five Senses. Jan Brueghel the Elder's famous variations on this motif - now in the Prado, Madrid - show a number of settings, each of which is associated with the five senses. The dramatic 'unity of character' has been divided into components of the senses, thus reflecting an increasing compartmentalization of the world into functional spheres - a world which is defined in terms of luxury goods.In Jan Brueghel's paintings, the part of purely passive reception or physical consumption is played by an allegorical female figure. Interestingly, by depicting her naked or semi-naked breasts and sometimes her entire body, the painter emphasizes an element of eroticism. In this way the consumption of luxury goods and an emotional state of ecstasy are recognized as a syndrome.In the still-life of Hearing we can examine nearly all the instruments of the period. Near the Flemish harpsichord we can see a drum, a trumpet, a trombone, a cornetto, a lysard, several flutes, various sizes of violas and gambas, a lute, and a shawm. On a table to the right are a small horn, a trumpet, a bell and a reed pipe. The title of the musical score reveals that it is a six-part madrigal dedicated to Prince Pietro Philippi Albert and to Princess Isabella. The rifle, leaned against the chair, is rendered as a sound-producing implement, along with the other musical instruments used during a hunt; it does not unequivocally refer to Mars, as it has been proposed. In this painting the clock is not the symbol of transitoriness, rather it is a musical clock, several versions of which are visible in the right background. The talking and singing birds were also included on account of their voices. In the hall opening from the left rear, members of a musical group are entertaining themselves. The pictures on the wall of the room also refer to music: they depict the concert of the gods and Orpheus taming the wild animals with his music. The triptych showing the Annunciation and the announcement to the shepherds depicted on the inside cover of the harpsichord are also episodes which can be associated with sound.The nude female figure is, according to some opinions, Euterpe, the Muse of music, while others see her as Venus. The goddess of love may indeed be looked for in a painting associated with the human senses. Such supposition is supported by the presence of a little cherub (Amor?) in four of the five pictures, although he is only depicted as a winged Amor in the allegories of Touch and Sight.As an animal famous for its keen hearing, the stag became the symbol for this sense.

What did the Utrecht school of painters still round the surfaces of smoothly between light and shade?,"Judith Leyster is one of the very few women to have been accepted as a member of the Haarlem Guild of Painters. Although a contemporary historian described her as a leading light in art (punning on her name Leyster, which means ""lodestar"") she remained unknown for a long time and her works were either believed lost, or were attributed to Frans Hals. She probably worked in his studio around 1630 and was also a friend of his family, for one year later she became godmother to Hals' daughter Maria.Like Hals at the same time, the young Leyster adopted the style of the Utrecht Caravaggisti, with their strong chiaroscuro modelling in the manner of Caravaggio. From the mid-1620, she concentrated more on vividly illuminated genre scenes, generally featuring half figures of merry musicians, gamblers and whores, strongly influenced by the painting of Terbrugghen and Honthorst.While the Utrecht school of painters still rounded the surfaces of their objects smoothly between light and shade, Hals and his school adopted a broad, vibrant and independent brushstroke.

What can Couture see the work as that French painting had striven for between the Neoclassical period and Romanticism?,"The peak in theatrical Romanticism came in the Salon of 1847, Couture, a pupil of Gros, exhibited this painting nearly eight meters long.

Not only does the work cite painterly and compositional devices from old masters like Veronese, Tiepolo, Rubens and Poussin, but to Couture's contemporaries the artist also seemed to have succeeded in combining Antiquity and the present. It is all to be found united here:  the antique columned hall, sculpture competing with living figures, beautiful forms created with line  in the manner of Ingres, and Delaroche's delight in detail.A woman is the central figure, placed so that she will draw all eyes. She is stretched out in the middle of a large crowd of people who are abandoning themselves to all the vices that are supposed to have led to the downfall of Roma.

She is stretched out in the middle of a large crowd of people who are abandoning themselves to all the vices that are supposed to have led to the downfall of Roma. The scene is framed by five larger-than-life-size sculptures representing men from Roman history, their gestures seeming to demand a return to virtue",Couture

What are extremely naturalistic paintings?,"The Villa Chiericati was built in the first half of the sixteenth century for Ludovico Chiericati, a nobleman from Vicenza.

A room on the north side, called Room of Landscapes, was decorated with six frescoes of landscape scenes, each incorporating two zodiac signs, by Lodewijk Toeput. During one of the updatings the frescoes were painted over, and it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century, on the occasion of yet another restoration, that they were finally revealed.The landscapes contain explicit references to the sequence of the seasons and their related zodiac signs, the marking of time that rhythmically measures the work and the days of good guardianship of the land.

What is a small-scale work of the kind that were set upon portable altars in the oratories of wealthy individuals?,"The armorial bearings on the back indicate that this portable triptych was the property of Jehan Braque and his wife Catherine de Brabant, of Tournai, who were married in about 1450-51. Jehan Braque died soon afterwards, in 1452; his young widow, who did not marry again till 1461, must have commissioned this triptych in his memory.The Braque Triptych ranks among Rogier van der Weyden's most celebrated works. It is a small-scale work of the kind that were set upon portable altars in the oratories of wealthy individuals. When closed, it shows the classical vanity theme, a skull and a cross. Open, it displays images of Christ in the centre, and to either side - the Virgin, St John the Evangelist, St John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene. They are represented against a landscape that is rendered down to the finest detail, with its rivers and mountains, grass and leaves so precisely drawn they could almost be counted and tiny figures visible in the distance in the streets of imaginary towns - a favourite motif of the Flemish masters.Pictures showing busts of Christ and the Virgin had existed earlier north of the Alps, but a sequence of several saints shown half length seems to derive from a type of altarpiece found in Italy from the 13th century onward. The innovation is to place them in front of a wide, coherent landscape relating to the figures themselves not realistically, but in context. It stands for the entire world ruled by Christ and to which He descended incarnate as man, as described at the beginning of the Gospel of St John: ""And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."" If the dark exterior was a reminder of the inevitability of death, the wide, radiant interior with its saintly figures allowed the devout viewer to hope for salvation.Artistically, the triptych is very close to the Beaune Altarpiece. The head of the Virgin Mary, and in particular the head of Christ, are so like their counterparts in the picture of the Last Judgment that they must have been executed from the same cartoon (full-size design for a painting). It is not certain whether the work is entirely by Rogier's hand; the underdrawing reveals thin lines not at all typical of him, and perhaps done with a pen instead of Rogier's usual brush. There are also some differences in the artistic execution: the Virgin's face, for instance, looks waxen, and inflexible around the eyes by comparison with the wonderful, tenderly painted, and lifelike Mary Magdalene, which is among Rogier's finest works",this portable triptych

When was the Coronation of the Virgin painted?,"One of the tasks required of Vel·zquez, the court painter, was the painting of altarpieces, though to a lesser extent than painting portraits.

Who is the capable if not particularly innovative or sensitive artist very closely related to Rogier and in particular to?,"Robert Campin, who is generally identified as the Master of FlÈmalle, had a workshop in Tournai from 1406 at the latest, and, as we know from several documents, it received many commissions from the city, various institutions, and private individuals. According to a document (which is a copy of old records of the painters' guild, dating from around 1482, that is to say some 50 years later) a certain Jacques Daret was an ""apprentice"" in the workshop at about the same time as Rogier van der Weyden; he joined it on 12 April 1427 and became a master on 18 October 1432. We do know, however, that Daret had already been working with Campin for over ten years, so he must have learned his trade as a painter long before 1427; the description ""apprenticeship"" cannot therefore be correct for him at this period. We may assume that both Daret and Van der Weyden completed their real apprenticeship earlier and they must have worked together in Campin's workshop around 1430 as trained painters.Four paintings executed by Campin's pupil Jacques Daret in 1434-35 for Jean du Clercq, abbot of St. Vaast in Arras, are extant and are unusually well documented. They originally ornamented the wings of an altar shrine decorated with alabaster sculptures. In these panels Daret shows himself a capable if not particularly innovative or sensitive artist, very closely related to Rogier and in particular to the Master of FlÈmalle. Daret's Visitation of Mary is so similar to Rogier's painting of the same subject (Museum der Bildende K¸nste, Leipzig)), which is certainly later, that we have to assume they had a common model. And Daret follows one picture from the ""FlÈmalle group"" so closely, the Nativity now in Dijon Museum, that it can almost be called a free copy.This kind of painting, which now appears mediocre in comparison with the works of masters such as Rogier van der Weyden, was still so new and unusual in its time that a chronicler tells us how the donor, Jean de Clercq, seen here kneeling on the left with his abbot's insignia, proudly showed this altarpiece wing to the participants in the peace conference negotiating the Treaty of Arras in 1435",to the Master

Stylistic affinities with works done during the decade in the city by Carel Fabritius, Pieter de Hooch, an Vermeer are apparent, and Vermeer's own exceptional masterpieces in this branch of painting can be viewed as part of the new movement.In Saenredam's earlier church interiors the line of vision is always at an angle of about 90&#176; to the centre of the nave or to the wall of the building he depicts. Houckgeest had the new idea  of shifting his position to the side to give an angle of about 45&#176; to the principal axis of the church. The new position creates intriguingly intricate diagonal views across the church. Emanuel de Witte experimented with similar perspectival schemes about 1650. His earliest dated interior that employs the new point of view is the Interior of the Oude Kerk at Delft during a Sermon. It does not focus on a tomb of a hero, but on the minister preaching from a pulpit, which is still in place, to a large congregation.

Whose helmet does a page carry?,"This likeness of the king on horseback takes as its point of departure the archetypal image on the obverse of all the Great Seals of England: the sovereign as warrior. King Charles is wearing Greenwich-made armour and holding a commander's baton. A page carries his helmet. In keeping with the imperial claim of the inscription (in Latin on the tablet tied to the tree in this portrait: CAROLUS REX MAGNAE BRITANIAE - Charles King of Great Britain), the pose and woodland setting echo Titian's equestrian portrait of the Emperor Charles V at Muhlberg. (Titian's painting itself recalled the famous Roman bronze of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius on horseback.) Over his armour Charles wears a gold locket bearing the image of Saint George and the Dragon, the so-called Lesser George. He wore it constantly; it contained a portrait of his wife, and was with him the day he died. Here, however, it identifies him with the Order of the Garter of which Saint George was patron. As Garter Sovereign he is riding, like Charles V, at the head of his chivalrous knights in defence of the faith. In a profound sense the portrait is a visual assertion of Charles's claim to Divine Kingship. Albeit high above our heads - the horizon line ensures that our viewpoint is roughly at the level of his stirrup - his face is undistorted by foreshortening. Van Dyck's three-quarter view refines his features, and he bestrides his horse with a remote air of noble contemplation",King Charles's helmet

Who really are?,"In 1516 Titian made contact with Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara for whom he was to work for a decade on pictures destined for the Alabaster Chamber. In this period he painted a series of magnificent paintings of Dionysian themes: the Worship of Venus in the Prado, The Andrians (Bacchanalia), also in the Prado, and Bacchus and Ariadne, in the National Gallery, London. In these paintings Titian combines a richness of colouristic expression with a great formal elegance. These are the elements which characterize this whole so-called ""classic"" phase of Titian's development and which is dominated by the supreme masterpiece of the Frari Assumption of the Virgin.Titian's sources for the Bacchus and Ariadne were a variety of classical texts (especially Catullus and Ovid), all of them concerning Ariadne, the daughter of the king of Crete. Because of her love for Theseus, she helped him escape her father's labyrinth by means of a ball of thread. However, Theseus deserted her on Naxos while they were returning to Athens. There, she became the lover of the god Bacchus. Above her, already visible, is a crown of stars representing the ""Corona Borealis"", into which she (or, according to a different tradition, her bridal head-dress) is eventually transformed.This painting is among Titian's most Raphaelesque, particularly in the contrapposto of Ariadne and the controlled energy of Bacchus and his train, who seem more numerous than they really are.

Who seem more numerous than Titian really are?,"In 1516 Titian made contact with Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara for whom he was to work for a decade on pictures destined for the Alabaster Chamber. In this period he painted a series of magnificent paintings of Dionysian themes: the Worship of Venus in the Prado, The Andrians (Bacchanalia), also in the Prado, and Bacchus and Ariadne, in the National Gallery, London. In these paintings Titian combines a richness of colouristic expression with a great formal elegance. These are the elements which characterize this whole so-called ""classic"" phase of Titian's development and which is dominated by the supreme masterpiece of the Frari Assumption of the Virgin.Titian's sources for the Bacchus and Ariadne were a variety of classical texts (especially Catullus and Ovid), all of them concerning Ariadne, the daughter of the king of Crete. Because of her love for Theseus, she helped him escape her father's labyrinth by means of a ball of thread. However, Theseus deserted her on Naxos while they were returning to Athens. There, she became the lover of the god Bacchus.

Who is not simply content?,"Market and kitchen scenes originally came from Flemish painting and above all are linked in the sixteenth century with Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer. In sharp contrast to Dutch still-life specialists, the Leiden Feinmalers around Gerard Dou reactivated these subjects for their small-format genre paintings, in which market goods were showed off to their best advantage in small, select groups. Metsu's Poultry Seller depicts just such a group of varied items, arranged along the painting's lower and left-hand margins; the precision with which they have been painted testifies to a supreme virtuosity in the Feinmaler style, and is accentuated in part by the use of light and dark contrasts. But importantly, each surface receives the same amount of attention: from different woods - a bamboo rod, basketwork, a barrel and a bare tree &#151; to the fluffy fur of the rabbit beside the pale flesh of the plucked hen in the basket, or from the bird's skeletal head, a strong contrast with the luminous red head of the turkey, to the trader's thick wool stockings that differ so from his young customer's delicate, filmy gauze apron. Metsu is not simply content, however, to use the Feinmalers' technique of applying flat, narrow brush strokes one beside the next.

What was Head Chancellor of the Papal Court?,"A new fresco occupied Raphael during the period 1511-1512: the Prophet Isaiah painted for Johannes Goritz of Luxemburg, Head Chancellor of the Papal Court. That the work was commissioned by a foreigner is indicative of the extraordinary fame that Raphael had acquired. This powerful but composed prophet and the putti who surround him echo Michelangelo's figures in the Sistine Ceiling. Nonetheless, the putti, whose glances and poses are enlivened by a strong spiritual tension, are transformed by Raphael into tender and formally controlled children. Even the action of the wind that blows Isaiah's mantle is a life-giving device rather than an expression of dramatic feeling. The dedicatory inscription in Greek (which alludes to St Anne, patron of Goritz) and the Hebrew scroll which the Prophet holds, reflect the learned environment in which the work was conceived.According to Vasari, Raphael repainted it after seeing Michelangelo's prophets. The fresco in later centuries was repainted several times and restored in 1960",Luxemburg

Whose assimilation of Drer do elements of the work also show?,"Gr¸newald's earliest datable work is the Mocking of Christ, a colourful, vehemently expressive painting demonstrating his ability to create dazzling light effects. The painting depicts Christ blindfolded and being beaten by a band of grotesque men. The figures are thick-bodied, soft, and fleshy, done in a manner suggestive of the Italian High Renaissance. Elements of the work also show Gr¸newald's assimilation of D¸rer, specifically his Apocalypse series. Different from High Renaissance idealism and humanism, however, are Gr¸newald's uses of figural distortion to portray violence and tragedy, thin fluttering drapery, highly contrasting areas of light and shadow, and unusually stark and iridescent colour. It is these elements, already in evidence in this early work, that Gr¸newald was to develop into the masterful, individualistic style most fully realized in his Isenheim Altarpiece",Grnewald's assimilation of Drer

What is Mary sitting in at the moment of the Annunciation?,"The picture shows the right wing of the Dijon Altarpiece.The most distinctive aspect of the Dijon Altarpiece is the arrangement of the sacred architectural settings which occupy virtually all of two out of the four scenes.

Both died soon afterward, and during Mass their nurse saw how they rose up out of their graves and fled from the church. Benedict promptly administered the host to the errant souls, thereby luring them back into the bosom of the community.The composition of this scene is clearly indebted to Pinturicchio's cycle in the Piccolomini Library in Siena.

What does the monumental figure of the Chancellor kneel in before a lectern?,"This is the portrait of Fouquet's that most strongly reflects the spirit of the Renaissance. The subject of the portrait was a powerful lord, the Chancellor of France of both Charles VII and Louis XI, one of the leading notabilities of France. The background, composed of Renaissance architecture with lavish gilded panellings inlaid with marble fillings displays an Italian influence. Against this background the monumental figure of the Chancellor kneels in prayer before a lectern, on which a great folio lies open on a cushion of red, white and yellow stripes. The red of his robe, trimmed with brown fur at the neck and sleeves, is reflected in the heavy, fleshy face of the Chancellor, on his thin lips, and on the head, which combines an overall impression of strength, intelligence and extraordinary dignity. The decorative harmony of the red and gold in which his head is framed only serves to enhance the imposing effect of the whole figure. With this portrait Fouquet earns his place as a fit contemporary of the great masters of the Italian Quattrocento, Andrea Mantegna, Piero della Francesca and Antonello da Messina",in prayer

What did Inscription in the top leave by?,"Inscription in the top left by someone else (?): OSWOLT KREL 1499.This portrait comes from the collection of the Princes Oettingen-Wallerstein, who had acquired it in 1812; if has been in its present location since 1928. It is presumed that Oswolt Krell, a merchant for the Ravensburg House in Nuremberg from 1495 to 1503, had asked the artist for a true portrait of representation. Its notable size, similar to that adopted by D¸rer for the portrait of his father two years earlier, and its setting, a half-length, suggests this. In this way, it differs from the Tucher portraits, which were intended for private use.The background, as in the Tucher portraits (Schlossmuseum, Weimar), is divided between the curtain and landscape passage, unlike those, however, it is divided rather unevenly. The bright red curtain is wide and occupies most of the space on the right; the landscape, on the left, is reduced to a foreshortening that shows a small part of a river that meanders toward the back, behind a group of tall trees. The windowsill that separated the subject from the landscape in the Tucher paintings is absent. The figure represented, set with obvious grandiosity, is found in front of the curtain, highlighted by intense colour.The large fur-lined cloak is casually placed on the right shoulder only, to show, on the left side, the rich black garment with the puffed sleeve. To the disorderly folds of the cloak correspond the parallel horizontal folds of the sleeve and the vertical ones of the garment. The three-quarter position allows the painter to bring out the quality of the attire: the fur, silk shirt, and gold chain. The careful, fastidious representation of these meaningful details creates a powerful foundation for the setting of the head: vigorous, strong features, the pronounced nose and the strong-willed mouth, the furrowed eyebrows, as if from a sudden start or fright that makes him direct his gaze off to the side behind him. Everything works to make his face threateningly severe, which even the soft, light brown hair framing him does not attenuate. To the energetic expression of the face corresponds the nervous look of his left hand clutching his cloak and that of the contraction of the knotted fingers of the right hand that leans on an invisible window sill.Colour, form, and proportion heighten the expression of supreme resolution, an expression that is the result of a serious psychological study that D¸rer conducted on the merchant, who was the same age as the artist and who was later to become the mayor of Lindau, his native city.The two side panels that represent two ""sylvan men"" are wings to the portrait. They bear the heraldic shields of the subject and his wife, Agathe von Esendorf.

To the energetic expression of the face corresponds the nervous look of his left hand clutching his cloak and that of the contraction of the knotted fingers of the right hand that leans on an invisible window sill.Colour, form, and proportion heighten the expression of supreme resolution, an expression that is the result of a serious psychological study that D¸rer conducted on the merchant, who was the same age as the artist and who was later to become the mayor of Lindau, his native city.The two side panels that represent two ""sylvan men"" are wings to the portrait.

How many side panels that represent two'' ``sylvan men'''' bear the heraldic shields of the subject and the painter's wife?,"Inscription in the top left by someone else (?): OSWOLT KREL 1499.This portrait comes from the collection of the Princes Oettingen-Wallerstein, who had acquired it in 1812; if has been in its present location since 1928. It is presumed that Oswolt Krell, a merchant for the Ravensburg House in Nuremberg from 1495 to 1503, had asked the artist for a true portrait of representation. Its notable size, similar to that adopted by D¸rer for the portrait of his father two years earlier, and its setting, a half-length, suggests this. In this way, it differs from the Tucher portraits, which were intended for private use.The background, as in the Tucher portraits (Schlossmuseum, Weimar), is divided between the curtain and landscape passage, unlike those, however, it is divided rather unevenly. The bright red curtain is wide and occupies most of the space on the right; the landscape, on the left, is reduced to a foreshortening that shows a small part of a river that meanders toward the back, behind a group of tall trees. The windowsill that separated the subject from the landscape in the Tucher paintings is absent. The figure represented, set with obvious grandiosity, is found in front of the curtain, highlighted by intense colour.The large fur-lined cloak is casually placed on the right shoulder only, to show, on the left side, the rich black garment with the puffed sleeve. To the disorderly folds of the cloak correspond the parallel horizontal folds of the sleeve and the vertical ones of the garment. The three-quarter position allows the painter to bring out the quality of the attire: the fur, silk shirt, and gold chain.

Successive art historians have moved the painting to the early 1440's, comparing it to the Annunciation in Munich and recognizing in it the beginnings of Lippi's attachment to the style of Fra Angelico. The participation of Andrea del Castagno has also been suggested, with a date of around 1440. The portraits of the donors, more recently identified as Folco Portinari and Folgonaccio, were probably carried out with the help of an assistant",the painting

What remains an important example of Boschian invention?,"The triptych of the Last Judgment is a fascinating work of art which comes surprisingly close to the unmistakable style of the strange moralist from 's-Hertogenbosch. The emphasis in the development of the theme is on the all-besetting evil and perennial human stupidity that render the world a hell even before the day of divine jjudgment. The extraordinary combination of motifs is often derived from vernacular symbolism and imagery: The inventive use of colours and the sharp, supple brushwork have persuaded many critics that Bosch himself was the author of this painting. In spite of the work's pictorial qualities, several factors seem to undermine this attribution. Nevertheless, the triptych remains an important example of Boschian invention. It dates from the early sixteenth century.At the time of his death, Bosch was internationally celebrated as an eccentric painter of religious visions who dealt in particular with the torments of hell. During his lifetime Bosch's works were in the inventories of noble families of the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and they were imitated in a number of paintings and prints throughout the 16th century, especially in the works of Pieter Bruegel the Elder.",the triptych

When was the outlaw's life and figure a major concern for Munkcsy ever?,"The outlaw's life and figure was a major concern for Munk·csy ever since his childhood. It is known from his ""Memoirs"" that  he suffered much during the years of apprenticeship and that he always  wanted to see a living outlaw as a symbol of free life even  if he had to wait for him under a table in the inn.In the drama of  ""Condemned Cell"", he painted the embarrassed apprentice. Munk·csy had followed the life of his hero in his earliest genre pictures painted in 1867 or illustrations for journals. He needed an immense amount of skill in order to paint a true picture of a man condemned to death who had been given proper food and looked after for three days, and then his family, friends and enemies were to come to say good-bye to him. His wife is sobbing her heart out in a corner, his little daughter is pottering about not knowing what is going on and she is munching something. The outlaw must have resigned to his lot and has nothing more to expect of life: he throws the Bible to the ground. A patch of the blue sky becomes visible behind  the bars",since his childhood

Who were both paintings sold in 1650 by?,"The portrait is inscribed `1497 Albrecht D¸rer the Elder at age 70'. D¸rer's father appears considerably older than in the portrait of seven years earlier. His lips are thinner, his face more heavily lined with wrinkles and his narrow eyes have a wearier appearance. Yet Albrecht the Elder has retained his wisdom and dignity. After his death, D¸rer wrote that his father `passed his life in great toil and stern, hard labour...He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities.' Albrecht the Elder died five years after this portrait was painted, at the age of 75.The condition of this painting is poor, particularly in the background and the cloak, and in the past many scholars believed that it was a copy of a lost original. However, since it was cleaned in 1955, there has been more support for the view that this is indeed the original. Fortunately the face is the part of the picture which remains in the best condition.This portrait may originally have been displayed with D¸rer's self-portrait of the following year, either hung in the same room in the family home or even linked as a diptych. Although D¸rer and his father are wearing very different clothing and the backgrounds do not match, the two portraits are almost the same size and the half length poses are similar. The pictures were apparently kept together as a pair, since they were presented by the city of Nuremberg to the Earl of Arundel in 1636 as a gift for Charles I of England. Both paintings were sold in 1650 by Cromwell. The portrait of Albrecht D¸rer the Elder stayed in Britain and was eventually bought by the National Gallery in 1904",by Cromwell

What are most likely associated with love?,"Metsu's indisputable masterpieces are Man Writing a Letter and Woman Reading a Letter which were painted as companion pieces. In both paintings, the way the silvery daylight flows over the figures set against light walls is not surpassed by Vermeer.

Here letter writing and reading are most likely associated with love. The discreet waiting maid pulls aside a curtain hanging from a rod to reveal a choppy seascape, possibly but not demonstrably a reference to the popular adage that love is as hazardous as a sea voyage. The maid's momentary movement contrasts with the concentration of the young woman who, one senses, will not move until she has finished reading the letter.The curtain over the painting is not an unusual detail.

Who is an extremely valuable work housed in Santa Maria del Giglio: a Virgin and Child with the Infant St John by?,"An extremely valuable work is housed in Santa Maria del Giglio: a Virgin and Child with the Infant St John by Rubens, the only painting by this artist in Venice. The central section on paper is by Rubens, and this is fixed onto canvas and connect- ed to a generic background comprising a tree and curtain hanging on the right, by a late seventeenth-century painter probably from the Veneto.Despite its critical vicissitudes over the centuries, there is no lack of elements substantiating the author of the painting and its very high quality: the brilliant quality of the afresh tones, especially in the children; the emotional intensity of the looks; the material richness and the expert technique evident in the several tones of Titian-style red on which the chromatic distribution of the entire fragment is based. Deep layers of solid and glazed lacquer are superimposed, often tone on tone and finely touched, from the clothes of the Virgin shaded in the grey filaments and earth green of the veil falling on her neck, to the profiles and extremely tender tips of the two children's fingers, heightened in white with the tip of the brush. Then there is the skillful painting of the Virgin's ear and of every other element in the work; the power of invention and of colour evident in the small patch of sky; the effect of shaping on form, seen in the facial features and breast of the Virgin, portrayed to great plastic effect, and partly the entire placement of the figures and overall composition, sensitive to the lessons of Caravaggio",by Rubens

What poses?,"Cornelis Engebrechtsz. headed a large painters' workshop in the first decades of the 16th century, and trained Lucas van Leyden, Aertgen van Leyden and his own three sons, Pieter Cornelisz, Cornelis Cornelisz and Lucas Cornelisz. He and his pupils and assistants produced altarpieces and numerous smaller works for private devotion. One of his chief patrons was the Augustinian nunnery of Mari&#235;npoel just north of Leiden. Among the works he made for the convent church were altarpieces with the Lamentation (c. 1508) and the Crucifixion (c. 1517), which were described by Karel van Mander in 1604 and are now in Leiden's Museum de Lakenhal.The Amsterdam painting undoubtedly comes from an altarpiece illustrating episodes from the life of the Virgin. It was recognised as Engelbrechtsz.'s work in 1904, and shortly afterwards the Rijksmuseum was able to acquire a second, less well-preserved panel from the same altarpiece: Christ in the House of Martha and Mary.The events depicted in the two panels are not found in the Bible but in the popular late-medieval Meditationes vitae Christi. Both scenes precede the Arrest of Christ. In the conversation with his mother and Mary Magdalen, Christ refused to abandon his planned visit to Jerusalem during the Jewish Passover, and foretold his impending death.The second panel shows Christ taking leave of his mother, immediately before he and his disciples set off for Jerusalem. Movingly he embraces the kneeling Virgin amidst the sorrowful Marys and the apostles. Some of the disciples are descending into the valley on the right, with the city gate and walls of Jerusalem in the distance.The attribution of the panels to Engelbrechtsz., based partly on the correspondences in style, colouring and manner of execution with the Crucifixion triptych in Leiden, was recently confirmed by an examination of the two underdrawings using infrared reflectography. This painting is a fine example of the artist's more mature work. The poses and gestures in the figure group highlight the emotional nature of the leave-taking.

The Master of the Female Half-Lengths, a close follower of Patenier, is the likely painter who added the landscape behind the figures",in the Netherlands
What pose?,"This panel was probably the left half of a diptych, the right half with probably a praying donor has not survived. The most interesting feature of the painting is the Virgin's particularly contemplative mood and pose. The gesture of a figure with head in hand goes back to antiquity, and Renaissance examples featured Christ, Job, and St Jerome among others in this pose of contemplation.

What has its finest expression in the Crucifix that Cimabue painted for Santa Croce in around 1287-88?,"The exact identification of the names of the two painters, active in Umbria during the middle of the thirteenth century was discovered in 1948. The painting is signed and dated at the foot of the cross: ""Simone et Machilon pinserunt Hoc opus Anno Domini MCCLVII Domina Maria fieri Fecit"". Because it is one of the very few dated crosses from its period, this panel is an important reference point for the chronological reconstruction of thirteenth century central Italian workshop activity.Stylistically, the design follows the Giunta Pisano Crucifix in the church of San Domenico in Bologna, datable to around 1250 and the known prototype for a number of late thirteenth century crosses. This series has its finest expression in the Crucifix that Cimabue painted for Santa Croce in around 1287-88. Yet though they adhere strictly to the model of Giunta, especially in iconographic aspects, Simone and Machilone show some original characteristics, above all in the attenuation and hardness of line in the figure of Christ, less severe and more human in the National Gallery cross. Likewise, Simone and Machilone render anatomic details less schematically than their prototype. From Giunta, on the other hand, the artists inherit the languid abandon of the dead body of Christ, which they interpret with perfect mastery. Also masterfully rendered is the complex Hebraic drapery wrapped around the body, different from the brown drapery of Giunta's Christ, which provided the prototype for another Cross, attributed to Coppo di Marcovaldo, in the Pinacoteca of San Gimignano.",this series

Van Mander remained vague about the actual significance of the painting. Perhaps it had already been forgotten by his time. We can be certain, however, that Bruegel gave the work a hidden allegorical or religious meaning, albeit one that remains a mystery. A great many experts have devoted their energies to solving the problem, but none has ever succeeded entirely in explaining the painting. Most of them focus on the possible symbolism of the large woman in the foreground, with her suit of armor, sword, cutlery and money-box. She has been variously interpreted as a symbol of heresy or violence, the personification of hum,an evil and an allegory of instability.Recently it was proposed that Meg symbolizes Madness, a vice taken in the 16th century to include insanity, rage, gluttony, lust, avarice and ambition, and that the giant figure in the centre of the painting is an allegory of Folly. The additional scenes surrounding the two figures illustrate the causes and repercussions of these two human failings. It was concluded that Bruegel's allegory was intended as an attack on both human nature and the political and religious situation in 16th-century Antwerp.We could fill a book with suggested interpretations of Mad Meg and it is highly doubtful whether it would bring the viewer any closer to the true meaning of the painting. Nevertheless, the work never fails to fascinate, even without specialist knowledge. No one can fail to appreciate its apocalyptic vision.

"Who worked in Amsterdam Delft, but seldom in Haarlem?","During the second quarter of the 17th century a group of artists began to specialize in painting the life of soldiers. Scenes of plunder and battle were depicted but the ancient battle of sexes, where the field of action was a room in an inn or a barrack, and in which the outcome of the struggle is not much in doubt, was more frequently represented. Other popular subjects were soldiers drinking, smoking and gambling at cards or tric-trac, activities that contemporary predicants and moralists condemned as vices that endanger salvation. But it is doubtful if the painters of these scenes and their clients viewed them as pictorial reminders of the perils of sin and the inexorable need to lead a virtuous life. Pictures of the life of off-duty soldiers were called by the Dutch 'cortegaardjes' a corruption of the French term 'corps de garde'. The better ones show little movement or overt action. Painters of them had a special feeling for tonal values and their pictures take on a certain still-life quality. In their half-dark interiors the light glitters over uniforms, and a fine subdued play of colours, mostly broken and harmonized by delicate half-tones, betrays the Dutch gift for intimate pictorial qualities and a subtle rendering of textures. Some even anticipate the achievement of the high society painters of the following generation, when well-to-do burghers rather than soldiers and their friends became the favoured subject of genre painters. Specialists in this category worked in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Delft, but seldom in Haarlem. The leading ones in Amsterdam were Willem Duyster and Pieter Codde.What sets Duyster's rare pictures apart from those made by his contemporaries is his distinct chiaroscuro and the refinement of his colours. He was also better able than any of them to convey the fascinating visual drama which can take place  when people do little more than confront each other. It is difficult to think of a painter of his time who surpasses his penetrating characterization of the personalities of the men gathered round a fireplace in the modest nocturnal scene in the Soldiers beside a Fireplace in the Philadelphia museum. (Versions are also in the Hermitage, and in D¸sseldorf.)  Duyster's approach is always original.

What is a horse's fiery or faithful natures- few painters?,"Philip IV was a bold and enthusiastic huntsman, it was usual for the king to ride out with a small retinue in the extensive game preserves of the densely wooded Pardo.

This tower was known as the Torre de la Parada, and Philip, who was particularly fond of it, extended it to make a comfortable hunting lodge. He was in haste to see it furnished, and commissioned Rubens to provide a large collection of new pictures on mythological subjects.After 1638, when the building itself was completed, it was the task of Vel·zquez to decide how they should be hung, and to contribute a series of hunting portraits himself, to hang with other appropriate works already in existence and with pictures by Dutch masters. This project cost him a great deal of time and trouble, but it also won him increasing appreciation at court.Vel·zquez's three extant hunting portraits (Philip IV as a Hunter, Prince Baltasar Carlos as a Hunter, and Cardinal Infante Don Fernando as a Hunter) are life-size.

This tower was known as the Torre de la Parada, and Philip, who was particularly fond of it, extended it to make a comfortable hunting lodge. He was in haste to see it furnished, and commissioned Rubens to provide a large collection of new pictures on mythological subjects.After 1638, when the building itself was completed, it was the task of Vel·zquez to decide how they should be hung, and to contribute a series of hunting portraits himself, to hang with other appropriate works already in existence and with pictures by Dutch masters. This project cost him a great deal of time and trouble, but it also won him increasing appreciation at court.Vel·zquez's three extant hunting portraits (Philip IV as a Hunter, Prince Baltasar Carlos as a Hunter, and Cardinal Infante Don Fernando as a Hunter) are life-size. Don Fernando, the king's younger brother, despite his spiritual calling, did not hesitate to indulge his passion for hunting. In this painting, showing him with his gun at the ready, he looks even more of a huntsman than his relations. His expressive outline balances the silhouette of the cinnamon-coloured dog sitting in front of him, a figure once again illustrating the court painter's skill in depicting animals. He pays them as much careful attention as he expends on human beings; while he is of course aware of the differences between animals and humans, he is also conscious of the dignity shared by all living creatures. The natural elegance of a horse's head or the body of a dog, their fiery or faithful natures - few painters have captured the beauty and individuality of animals as unforgettably as Vel·zquez",this tower

What is shown in a flat plane?,"The right panel depicts the Beheading of St John the Baptist.As a lascivious worldly beauty, Salome wears a magnificent dress in the fashion of French princesses, with exotic decorative items including the pointed head-dress. The background shows the scene of the banquet in which Salome's mother, Herodias, stabs the decapitated head of the Baptist in her hatred for him.The shallow zone of the foreground is set off by the strong effects of depth in the side panels, where the rooms are almost like tunnels. This makes the narrative backgrounds of the left and right panels subordinate. In the beheading of the Baptist, the body of the executed man is part of the foreground group, and the executioner can set his sword against John's right shoulder, shown in a flat plane. At the same time, however, two mourners who belong to the background are placed directly above the cellar stairs where the dead man is lying, and a figure diminished to about one-third of the size of the foreground figures appears to be standing only a little farther back from them.The side panels of the St John Altarpiece do not merely show the beginning and end of the Baptist's earthly life. The parallels between the pictorial motifs also express moral conflict. On the right, the unchaste Salome, in magnificent and seductive clothing, holds the Baptist's head. She and the executioner are turning away from each other and from their victim, as if painfully conscious of the crime that has been committed.Interestingly, however, the figure of Salome looks like a variant on the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation scene of the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), where the figure's knees are placed apart in an even more balletic position. Rogier was obviously able to make effective use of this elaborate and artificial pose in various circumstances, and only the worldly magnificence of Salome's dress and the context cause the viewer to assess it differently here. In addition, Salome's grave and melancholy face does not in fact differ much from the face of the Virgin Mary in that Annunciation, although in this later version it is leaning at rather too pronounced an angle to express grace. The artist has not set out simply to make the figure of Salome merely despicable; indeed, in the context of this scene, her noble features give her a touch of complex ambivalence",John's right shoulder

What does the artist take from Correggio's Mary Magdalene reading?,"The image of this famous repentant sinner, prototype of the penitent in Christian art, became one of the favourite subjects of European art in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.In a career that spanned only thirteen years, Fetti's work underwent an astonishing evolution, from objective realism to lyricism, from compact form to the erosion of space, from solid and plastic modeling to a broken and agitated kind of painting, from descriptive to tortuous brush strokes, from dry to oily and liquid tints, from local colour to tonality, and from analytical concreteness to a sweetly sentimental air. Here the artist takes his inspiration from Correggio's Mary Magdalene reading. He represents the sensual and seductive heroine with half-closed eyes, lowered head, and the characteristic gesture of the hand on which she rests her head, with an intensely melancholic significance, equivalent to 'tristitia'. In fact the painter conceived this theme in terms of a Meditation or Melancholy.It is worth remembering that Giovan Battista Andreini's drama Maddalena was published in Mantua in 1617, and may have provided the idea for the painting. In any case, the last possible date for its execution is 1621, the date on which a copy (now at Hampton Court), possibly the work of the painter's sister Lucrina Fetti, was delivered to Ferdinando Gonzaga",his inspiration

What are all three portrayed with Apollonian purity against?,"In this work, originally the altar-screen of the church of St Catherine, Veronesian colour reaches a peak of richness and splendour. Along the diagonal of the composition which terminates in the drapes billowing around the columns, new chromatic notes are struck; the 'fortissimo' of the steps and figures in the foreground harmonizes with the 'pianissimo' of angels and cherubs which emerge from the grey-gold clouds of the celestial kingdom in the background. Linking the two planes of colour are two cherubs holding the martyr's palm and the heavenly crown above the Virgin and St Catherine while the angel below lifts her head and holds out her arms to receive the sign and the reward of martyrdom. All three are portrayed with Apollonian purity against the intense blue of the sky, an unforgettable example of Veronese's exquisite use of colour. Even more appropriate is the 17th century comment by Marco Boschini: 'It is almost as if the painter to create his effects used gold, pearls and rubies, emeralds sapphires and purest, most perfect diamonds'.Here too, as in his pictures of religious feasts, Veronese successfully combines the religious subject with social pomp and ceremony, transforming the sacred event into a luxurious sixteenth-century festival.

St Jerome is kneeling in a humble posture that arouses our sympathy, in front of the sketched cross of Christ on the right, and before him lies the lion, his attribute. In his right hand he is holding a stone with which he is striking his breast. The head section of the unfinished panel was sawn out in the 18th century and not replaced and restored until the 19th century",the lion

What is the fate of the hair-covered members of the Gonzalez family noted for?,"Three small paintings in the collection of Archduke Ferdinand II of Tirol portray Pedro Gonzalez and his two oldest children. The ""hairy man from Munich"", as he is called, is considered the first documented case of the so-called ""Ambras Syndrome"", a congenital illness, which results in the growth of hair on the face as well as the entire body after birth. The fate of the hair-covered members of the Gonzalez family is noted for its reputation as a natural wonder. They were considered animals, who were both marvelled at and presented as gifts.

What is full of erudite symbolism?,"Johannes Spiessheimer (Cuspinian) was a scholar in the court of the Emperor Maximilian I, himself a writer, who made Vienna, through its chancellery and university, the leading humanist city in Germany. Cranach painted the double portrait of the Viennese humanist Dr. Cuspinian and his wife Anna, daughter of an official of the Emperor on the occasion of their marriage. Cranach composed these portraits as a pair. This is apparent in the continuity of the landscape behind the elegantly dressed couple. The trees at the edges of the painting, on the left and right of the figures, are placed so that their branches form an arch, imparting an air of grandeur to the sitters.The background was evidently composed with a distinct purpose in mind: nothing here is arbitrary. The landscape is full of erudite symbolism, probably devised by Cuspinian himself. The various images disguise hieroglyphic allusions to the cabbala. However, it would be quite unsatisfactory merely to decipher the landscape background symbol by symbol without seeing its significance as a whole. Beyond a system of occult signs, the landscape allows a generous framework for the couple's understanding of themselves, providing a medium for the new cult of sensitivity and awareness of nature which some humanists were propagating in literary form through the Classical topos of the pleasance, or pleasure-park",the landscape

Whose marriage took place in 1746?,"This charming picture belongs to Gainsborough's early period, when he was working in London and Suffolk.

Between 1860 and 1865 he painted five historical paintings, for which there are several sketches and versions: Young Spartans Exercising, Semiramis Founding a City, Alexander and Bucephalus, Jephthah's Daughter, and The Sufferings of the City of New Orleans, the latter being his first entry at the Salon.These paintings are very original and unlike any historical painting in the nineteenth century. They conformed to the rules of classicist composition, but they were also  innovative because of the freshness of his figures and the warm colours of his landscapes.The Young Spartans Exercising was reworked several times, and numerous related drawings and studies survive",they

Whose own son did the celebrated sculptor suggest?,"The Palazzo Grassi, overlooking the Grand Canal opposite the Ca' Rezzonico in Venice. was built for the Grassi family by Giorgio Massari between 1749 and 1766. The architect adopted an innovative solution on the ground floor, with its two-story high main hall, large colonnaded courtyard, and ""imperial style' main staircase, which proceed with grand theatrical effect from the Grand Canal faÁade through to the back of the building.For the decoration of the first staircase landing, Massari turned to his trusted sculptor, Giovan Maria Morlaiter, who is responsible for the large bas-relief that depicts Concord. It was the celebrated sculptor, who suggested his own son, Michelangelo, to execute the frescoes on the second landing. The architecture was painted by Francesco Zanchi (active 1734-1772).Morlaiter's decoration develops along the walls of the staircase space, at the level of the second landing. Inside seven large arches delimited by Ionic pilasters, he painted a large faux loggia, closed off at the back by a marble wall, against which statues of goddesses stand inside aedicules surmounted by rectangular tympanums. A carnival-like reception is under way on the loggia, and the participants include a number of elegant ladies and noblemen, some in wigs, some in three-cornered hats, as well as a prelate and an Eastern figure, all busy conversing amiably, or sipping coffee and liquors served by efficient waiters in livery.In spite of the fact that Morlaiter's authorship is well documented, in the nineteenth century the frescoes were attributed to several painters, among them Pietro Longhi",Giorgio Massari's own son

What was re-attributed to a much later artist in the 1970s?,"The fresco of Guidoriccio da Fogliano, depicting the conquest of the castles of Montemassi and Sassoforte in 1328, formed part of a fresco cycle ""Castelli"" which occupied the upper part of the wall opposite to the Maest&#224; in the Sala del Mappamondo. The cycle, commemorating the castles conquered by the Sienese, was initiated in 1314 by the representation of the Castle of Giuncarico, it was continued by the Guidoriccio and in 1331 by the Castles of Arcidosso and Piano. The latter were destroyed in 1361 when Lippo Vanni painted the Battles of Valdichiana and Poggio Imperiale. In the 1970s, the famous fresco, which had always been, considered the greatest example of Martini's artistic excellence, was re-attributed to a much later artist.

What do only four seem to be definitely from at present?,"Catalogue number: Bredius 615.In 1661, Rembrandt painted a small group of half-length figures of apostles, each with a strongly individualized character. At present only four seem to be definitely from his hand, though others have been attributed to him. One of the four is this St Bartholomew and another, slightly distinct from the rest because Rembrandt used himself as the model, is St Paul.St Bartholomew holds his traditional attribute, the knife with which he was flayed to death. It is, of course, no more than a formal means of identifying him and as such was a common device in art. Apart from the knife, there is nothing in Rembrandt's painting to indicate that the figure is a saint; not even his clothes are obviously antique, and he grasps the knife as if he were about to cut something with it.

What does the triptych with the Baptism of Christ still breathe?,"The work of Gerard David, another foreigner drawn to the wealthy city of Bruges, offers a final summary of the technical and spiritual tradition of the fifteenth century.

In both works, Memling's flawless precision and cool smoothness are combined with the anatomical realism and seriousness of Van der Goes.The triptych with the Baptism of Christ, even though it was probably done after the Judgment of Cambyses, still breathes the quiet, ethereal atmosphere so characteristic of the Flemish Primitives.

David was born in Oudewater in Holland, but worked mostly in Bruges between 1484 and 1523, where, in a manner of speaking, he became Memling's successor. Two of his masterpieces, The Judgment of Cambyses (1498) and the Triptych of Jan des Trompes, belong to the Groeninge Museum in Bruges. In both works, Memling's flawless precision and cool smoothness are combined with the anatomical realism and seriousness of Van der Goes.The triptych with the Baptism of Christ, even though it was probably done after the Judgment of Cambyses, still breathes the quiet, ethereal atmosphere so characteristic of the Flemish Primitives. It is also one of the period's most remarkable artistic evocations of landscape and flora. It was commissioned by Jan des Trompes, a leading civil servant in Bruges, who appears in the painting with his first and second wives (front and rear of the right wing). His third wife donated it to the Chapel of the Vierschaar tribunal in Saint Basil's Church after his death",the leading civil servant in Bruges
Whose style was astonishingly innovative?,"In his period in Vienna, Cranach's style was astonishingly innovative, as seen in the Crucifixion of 1503, with its slanting perspective. The sparkling colour range he used at the time reveals unmistakable parallels with the Danube school, but it is not clear whether he came into contact with Albrecht Altdorfer, Wolf Huber and others",Cranach's style

What dominates the predella from Rome's central position?,"Three compositions, executed in a delicate monochrome and showing the Theological Virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity), combine to form the predella of an altarpiece that Atalanta Baglioni commissioned from Raphael, possibly toward the middle of the year 1506, for the family chapel in the church of S. Francesco al Prato in Perugia. The noblewoman intended the work to commemorate her son, Grifonetto, who had been assassinated in July 1500 during the struggles between rival branches of her family to establish control over Perugia.The altarpiece was originally composed of a large central panel showing the Deposition of Christ (now in the Borghese Gallery, Rome), a pinnacle with God the Father, Blessing between Angels (painted by a pupil, now in the National Gallery of Umbria, Perugia), and the predella. Both the main panel and the predella were carried from Perugia to Rome by Pope Paul V. They were replaced by copies in 1608.Charity, which dominates the predella from its central position, is the most complex of the three predella figures. The tondo with the personification of the virtue has clearly been influenced by Michelangelo's Pitti Madonna; on one side a putto holds a flaming torch on its shoulders, while on the other a putto tips coins out of a bowl. Hope, forming the right-hand section of the predella, has at its centre the allegorical figure. On either side are putti in confident attitudes. Faith, traditionally identified by the chalice and host, is flanked by two small angels holding plaques with the Greek inscriptions ""CPX"" and ""IHS,"" alluding to the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.",Charity

What are children?,"The painting is referred to as the ""encyclopaedia of Flemish children's games"". It represents about 84 games some of them are practiced until present days. There is also an assumption that the painting is part of a four-piece cycle representing either the Four Seasons or the Ages of Man.

They are playing with pieces of wood, with bones, with hoops and barrels - specially crafted toys were rare in the 16th century. Their faces often appear ageless: perhaps the painter wished to warn the observer against frittering away his life as if it were a childlike game. The children, who range in age from toddlers to adolescents, roll hoops, walk on stilts, spin tops, ride hobby-horses, stage mock tournaments, play leap-frog and blind man's buff, perform handstands, inflate pigs' bladders and play with dolls and other toys. They have also taken over the large building that dominates the square: it may be a town hall or some other important civic building, in this way emphasizing the moral that the adults who direct civic affairs are as children in the sight of God.

What is to some extent relieved by the landscape in the top left-hand corner?,"The painting is referred to as the ""encyclopaedia of Flemish children's games"". It represents about 84 games some of them are practiced until present days. There is also an assumption that the painting is part of a four-piece cycle representing either the Four Seasons or the Ages of Man. If that was Bruegel's intention, it is unlikely that the series progressed beyond this painting, for there are no contemporary or subsequent mentions of related pictures.Bruegel has portrayed over 250 children on this panel. They are playing with pieces of wood, with bones, with hoops and barrels - specially crafted toys were rare in the 16th century. Their faces often appear ageless: perhaps the painter wished to warn the observer against frittering away his life as if it were a childlike game.

What is the twisted body of Christ reminiscent of?,"The Deposition can perhaps justly be described as the artist's masterpiece. The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and drapes that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background. This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Piet&#224; or Lamentation over the Dead Christ. The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap. The Virgin, visibly distraught, and perhaps on the point of fainting, still glazes longingly towards her Son, and gestures with her right arm in the same direction. In the centre of the painting, the moment of the separation is underlined by the subtle contact of Mary's legs with those of Christ, now freed from his Mother's last pathetic embrace. The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Piet&#224; (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin. Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father. The general direction of the movement is, in fact, a rising one, and is created by the ethereal quality of the weightless figures, and their slow, almost dance-like rhythm. The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens. The transparent shadows do not annul the colours, but actually become them, in the flesh tones invested with subtle shades of pink and green.The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself.

Staring at something beyond the confines of the painting and looking as though he were about to leave the pictorial space, he presents us with this complex and refined decoration of colours, forms",from the cross

Who is a temple whose columns are wound with garlands?,"Of all the Medici villas in the environs of Florence, Poggio Imperiale has the most imposing site and is also closest to the Palazzo Pitti, which became the official residence of the grand dukes in 1561.

From 1618 Maria Magdalena of Austria, the wife of Cosimo II de' Medici invested  a great sum on improvements made under the direction of Giulio Parigi. In 1624 the property was officially named Poggio Imperiale with reference to the grand duchess's imperial lineage. The lineage was also featured in the ambitious pictorial program of the public rooms and bedrooms which lay on the ground floor. However, the villa was stripped of its precious furnishings and art treasures from the seventeenth century under the Habsburg-Lorraine regency (1737-65).The decoration of Poggio Imperiale started again under the reign of Peter Leopold (1747-1792) who succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Tuscany when his eldest brother became emperor as Joseph II in 1765. This decoration was intended to set a new artistic direction and propagate new standards of taste: Neoclassicism.Three rooms in the south wing were frescoed in 1768-72 by Tommaso Gherardini and Giuliano Traballesi with the collaboration of Giuseppe del Moro, one of the best Tuscan perspective painters of the time. It was followed by the decoration of five rooms in the west wing in 1773-78. Here the frescoes were executed by Giuseppe Maria Terreni, Giuseppe Gricci, Giuseppe del Moro, Giuseppe Antonio Fabbrini, and Tommaso Gherardini.The picture shows the ceiling painting in one of the rooms in the south suite of the Villa Poggio Imperiale.

What was painted clearly left its mark behind on Ghirlandaio's work?,"""He painted in tempera, as a companion to this work, a Nativity of Christ which must excite the wonder of every thinking man, introducing his own portrait and some heads of shepherds, which are considered divine"" (Vasari).The Sassetti Chapel is consecrated to the birth of Christ, and as a result much in the chapel is conceived with that event in mind. The altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds is the chapel 's key work  not only in subject, but also in artistic merit. This composition was so successful that other artists frequently repeated it. Ghirlandaio himself appears in the scene, dressed as a shepherd. He is even allowed to come closer to the Christ Child than the donors, who appear in frescoes to the right and left, praying outside the confines of the panel. The artist, who is leading the shepherds, is kneeling and bringing the miracle of the birth of Christ to the attention of both the shepherds and the observers of the picture. His left hand, with which he is pointing to the Christ Child, is finely drawn and is superbly modelled in three dimensions. With his right hand, his painting hand, he is pointing to his chest, as he does in a later fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel. As Ghirlandaio is pointing both at the child and the garlands on the Roman marble sarcophagus, it is possible that the gesture is saying: ""This holy child was painted for you by me, the garland-maker Ghirlandaio.""The classical sarcophagus in the picture is not just a manger for the ox and ass. It also has an iconographical significance indicated by the Latin inscription along its front: Ense cadens. Solymo. Pompei Pului[us] Augur Numen. Ait. Quae me conteg[it] Urna Dabit. [While Fulvi(us), augur of Pompey, was falling by the sword in Jerusalem he said: the urn that covers (conceals) me shall bring forth a god]. This is an ancient prophecy by Fulvius. The animals' manger will serve as a crib for the Christ Child. In his Adoration of the Shepherds, Ghirlandaio combines this reference to the Roman classical age with knowledge of Flemish art and turns them into an integrated whole.An historic event that took place a few years before this work was painted clearly left its mark behind on Ghirlandaio's work. An altarpiece ordered by Tommaso Portinari from Hugo van der Goes in Bruges reached Florence in May 1483. Florentine artists saw van der Goes' Adoration of the Shepherds as a shining comet showing new ways of painting. In Ghirlandaio's altarpiece, the shepherds pushing their way into the picture from the right, with their harsh, life-like features, are drawn directly from this Flemish model.

What is not just a manger for the ox and ass?,"""He painted in tempera, as a companion to this work, a Nativity of Christ which must excite the wonder of every thinking man, introducing his own portrait and some heads of shepherds, which are considered divine"" (Vasari).The Sassetti Chapel is consecrated to the birth of Christ, and as a result much in the chapel is conceived with that event in mind. The altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds is the chapel 's key work  not only in subject, but also in artistic merit. This composition was so successful that other artists frequently repeated it. Ghirlandaio himself appears in the scene, dressed as a shepherd. He is even allowed to come closer to the Christ Child than the donors, who appear in frescoes to the right and left, praying outside the confines of the panel. The artist, who is leading the shepherds, is kneeling and bringing the miracle of the birth of Christ to the attention of both the shepherds and the observers of the picture. His left hand, with which he is pointing to the Christ Child, is finely drawn and is superbly modelled in three dimensions. With his right hand, his painting hand, he is pointing to his chest, as he does in a later fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel. As Ghirlandaio is pointing both at the child and the garlands on the Roman marble sarcophagus, it is possible that the gesture is saying: ""This holy child was painted for you by me, the garland-maker Ghirlandaio.""The classical sarcophagus in the picture is not just a manger for the ox and ass. It also has an iconographical significance indicated by the Latin inscription along its front: Ense cadens. Solymo. Pompei Pului[us] Augur Numen. Ait. Quae me conteg[it] Urna Dabit.

Who was afraid?,"In 1377 Pope Gregory XI returned to Rome and the magnificent palace of Avignon became only the residence of antipopes. The popes' ""captivity in Babylon"" had terminated, but Avignon continued to act as a channel through which Italian Gothic art gradually penetrated further and further into the rest of Europe. It was in Avignon that Luis Borrass· first came into contact with 'court' Gothic, in the period around 1400, when this style was widely adopted in numbers of countries; it became in fact an international style founded upon all that Borrass· has learned from the brothers Serra.The painting in the church of Santa Maria in Terrasa illustrates the text from St. Matthew: 'And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. And he saith unto them: Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him' (4, 19-20). This scene is connected with another one from the Gospel: 'Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship... the ship was now in the midst of the sea... Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled... And Peter said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?' (Matthew 15, 22-31). Christ's face and his gesture are very beautiful, but the figures of both Christ and the two disciples are still stereotyped, differing in size in the traditional manner of early religious paintings: on the other hand, his treatment of the fishermen, particularly the one who is rowing, testifies to his own acute observation and his ability to make use of it.This altarpiece manifests a mixture of archaic technique and new characteristics of the International Gothic.

What does Joachim Beuckelaer assemble the domestic scene in his studio in like Aertsen?,"Joachim Beuckelaer, the nephew and pupil of Pieter Aertsen, specialised in market scenes and genre paintings. Following the path opened up by his uncle, he responded to the growing demand of a prosperous bourgeoisie that wished to decorate their houses with works that reflected the lay character of their surroundings, whilst retaining a moral and religious significance.Jesus' visit to the house of Martha and Mary, taken from St Luke's Gospel, formed the basis of several representations from the mid-16th century onwards. In the religious context of the time, this scene illustrated one of the fundamental differences opposing Catholics and Protestants. The latter sought salvation in action whilst the former placed greater value on the contemplative life. Here the artist relegates the teaching of the divine word to the back of the painting, devoting the entire foreground to active life, incarnated by Martha, and in so doing juxtaposing a genre scene and a still-life. Like Aertsen, he assembles the domestic scene in his studio, drawing from a repertory of standard objects and utensils that he was to constantly reproduce elsewhere in various combinations. Again like Aertsen, he has borrowed from Serlio's treatise the Renaissance architecture in which he places his composition.However, it would be unfair to dismiss Beuckelaer as a mere follower. Rather the artist stands out by his extraordinary ability to reproduce textures in their full sensuousness, using a light and subtle stroke and a delicately gradated palette. With considerable virtuosity and delight he precisely depicts the varnished terracotta of the crocks, the flaccid skin of the plucked fowl, the starched but still supple serviettes, and the fragility of the hair drawn back over the kitchen-maid's temples. The soft greasiness of the meat or the velvety softness of the mallard duck are set against the flat glint of the tin pot and the glazed transparency of the cabochon glasses or berkemeier. A search for harmony guides him in the distribution of objects, colours, light and shade, in a careful composition that leaves nothing to chance.Multiplying the different levels of interpretation, the image moves beyond a simple illustration of the Gospel story to become a philosophical exegesis of visible reality.

"What does any man realize was a married woman, and would thus have brought dishonor on himself and his people?","Catalogue number: Bredius 416.Rembrandt's colouristic power increases tremendously during his last period, although not all of his mature works display it; some of the single portraits remain largely monochromatic. The so-called Jewish Bride of c. 1665, which may be a commissioned portrait of a couple in the guise of a biblical pair (such as Isaac and Rebecca), belongs to his most brilliant colouristic creations. Even in reproductions it is possible to see something of the fluctuating quality of his late paint, the vibrations of the tones, and the harmonious fusion of the whole; but they can hardly suggest the warmth of the fiery scarlets, the golden yellows, the delicate blues and olives, the powerful whites, and deep blacks of his late palette. The broad, calm, relief-like arrangement of the life-size half-figures recalls a certain type of Venetian Renaissance painting. This reveals a touch of classical taste, but the use of colour in the portrait is quite unclassical.Like The Night Watch, this is another misnamed masterpiece by Rembrandt which it would be insensitive to re-title. To be sure, the painting does not represent a Jewish bridal couple in the sense which the nineteenth century, which invented the title, would have had in mind. The picture would then have been regarded as a romantic costume-piece, its very strangeness and aura of secretiveness suggesting that it showed some exotic rite, which was outside the experience of a predominantly Christian society.There can be no doubt, however, that an intimate relationship between the two figures was intended by the artist. The man places his hand on the woman's breast, while she moves instinctively to protect her modesty, in the classic pose of the Venus pudica which Rembrandt would have known from engravings or casts of classical statues. Yet the couple show every sign of tenderness towards each other, so this is not a common seduction scene (a frequent enough subject in Dutch painting). The theme most widely favoured by modern scholars is Isaac embracing his wife Rebecca while they were being spied on by Abimelech (Genesis, Chapter XXVI), which Rembrandt had previously represented in a drawing. To summarize the Bible narrative, Isaac, staying in the land of the Philistines, passes off Rebecca as his sister, because, if the Philistines had wanted to seduce her and had known she was Isaac's wife, they would have felt obliged to kill him first. One day, Abimelech, the Philistine King, observes the couple from a window making love in secret and guesses the truth, namely that they are man and wife. He reproves Isaac for the deception, pointing out that any man might have lain with Rebecca in all innocence, not realizing she was a married woman, and would thus have brought dishonour on himself and his people",the theme most widely favored by modern scholars

Moreover, the sitter stands out by virtue of the signet ring on his left hand, the chain around his neck bearing several rings and a small cross, and above all the rich embroidery on his shirt collar and the precious fur trim on his gown. The garland of carnations in his hair, traditionally worn at weddings, indicates that the portrait might have been painted on the occasion of the betrothal of the sitter's son, John Frederick the Magnanimous, to Sibylle of Cloves in 1526, and that the Elector is depicted here as the father of the groom",at the age of 58
Who does the present half-length portrait show at the age of 58?,"John the Steadfast (1468&#151;1532) was a member of the Ernestine line of the House of Wettin. During the lifetime of his brother, Elector Frederick the Wise, he became involved in the business of government. After his brother's death in 1525, John the Steadfast inherited the position of Elector and became Cranach's new master, in which role he proved no less benevolent than Frederick the Wise.One of Cranach's main duties as court painter consisted in portraying the Saxon princes as well as their families and allies. The portraits were not only intended as documentation of the line of descent for royal ancestral galleries, but also as gifts.

What is San Domenico?,"The earliest of Fra Angelico's mural paintings is the Crucified Christ in the Chapter House of San Domenico, the room where the friars, sometimes joined by the laity, assembled for meetings. To enhance its poignant realism, the artist foreshortened Christ's lowered head and torso from the perspective of the kneeling worshipper. The slender, idealized body is anatomically detailed and luminously modelled. The inscriptions - in Hebrew, Greek and Latin - on the titulus of the cross identify Christ as 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.",the room

"What did Van Gogh paint Summer in blue and orange, represented by on the plain of La Crau in June?","Catalogue numbers: F 412 JH 1440.Van Gogh's production in Arles fell into a number of series, one of which comprised landscape paintings on the theme of the seasons. The original idea for a seasonal series, in which each season would be represented by a pair of complementary colours, had been put forward in Nuenen in 1884. On arrival in Arles in March 1888 van Gogh began to paint a series of canvases of blossoming orchards in pinks and greens entitled Spring. In June he painted Summer in blue and orange, represented by the harvest on the plain of La Crau, which lay between Arles and the ruined monastery of Montmajour. The painting is a pendant of the Haystacks in Provence (F 425). It was an important work for van Gogh; he made two preliminary drawings of the motif and when the painting was finished he made two further drawings after it.In the painting, the viewpoint is high and thus the great plain is laid out beneath us, receding more gradually to the distant towers of Montmajour and the hills beyond. Van Gogh often described the plain of La Crau in his letters, saying that apart from differences of colour it reminded him constantly of Holland, but not of modern Holland. In this landscape he saw the landscape paintings of the seventeenth-century artists Ruisdael and De Koninck, who were both famous for their panoramic landscapes",by the harvest

Who adopted the pyramidal composition at the top?,"In 1487, Ghirlandaio painted another Adoration of the Magi, a large circular painting for the Tornabuoni family. The date is confirmed by Roman numerals: MCCCCLXXXVII.Such tondos were particularly popular as decorative items in private rooms, and their circular form required a particularly skillful composition. In the centre the childlike Mary is enthroned with her child. In the background, behind the ruined arcades of a classical building, is a simple hut that provides the ox and ass with a stable and the holy family with shelter. The kings' large retinues are lined up right to the ruin, and only behind the Madonna is there a circle of empty space. In other words the composition is influenced by the form of the panel.On the left is a lovely group of four soldiers with helmets and lances, looking in various directions. The soldiers have four horses that are also looking in different directions. Their pendant on the right, further back, is a group of four other soldiers in magnificent contemporary armor. The horses in front of the ruin are also very successful, and in them Ghirlandaio showed that he was also capable of depicting animals with strong foreshortening and from various angles. The contrast between the magnificent gray stallion and the darker gray ass is surely intentional. Above these animals the observer's gaze wanders through the open arched architecture of the classical ruin out into the far distance. There, painted in an atmospheric paleness, is a city surrounded by water and reminiscent of Venice.The composition of this Adoration contains allusions to the unique panel created in 1481 by Leonardo da Vinci, now in the Galleria degli Uffizi. Though Leonardo never completed this work, it had an enormous influence on the artists of his age. Ghirlandaio adopted the pyramidal composition of the main figures, with Mary at the top. The circular empty space behind Mary in the tondo might also have been inspired by Leonardo's picture.A replica of this tondo, in smaller dimensions and entirely the work of Domenico's shop, is to be found in the Galleria Palatina at Palazzo Pitti in Florence",Ghirlandaio

Who became Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria following the death of his father?,"Rudolph II (1552-1612) was the son of the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II.

Instead he was familiar with a number of languages and was devoted to art and science, the latter including alchemy and astrology, a highly fashionable preoccupation at that time. He was also fascinated by magic and the occult. At the end of the 1590s mental illness rendered him incapable of governing his empire, which by that time was torn by disputes between Reformation and Counter-Reformation movements.
