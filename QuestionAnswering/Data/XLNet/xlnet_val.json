Christ among the Doctors is not only a smaller panel, but the brushwork is much more spontaneous and the paint is applied with broad and fluid strokes.

Just as Abraham is about to slit Isaac's throat an angel miraculously appears and points to a ram, tangled in a thicket, that can be sacrificed instead. Cigoli shows the moment at which the angel intervenes, pulling back Abraham's arm as he points to the ram. According to Cigoli's nephew, Giovanni Battista Cardi, the picture was painted while his uncle was working for Cardinal Pompeo Arrigoni in Frascati just outside Rome. Cigoli, a Florentine, is documented in Rome between 1606-07, a date which accords well with the style of The Sacrifice of Isaac. There are several preparatory studies for the painting, one of which is on the verso of a drawing for Massimo Massimi's Ecce Homo of 1607, making it safe to assume that Cigoli was working on both pictures at the same time.Although The Sacrifice of Isaac was painted in Rome, the composition clearly recalls the Florentine tradition of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Andrea del Sarto. Isaac's sensuous nude body, however, reflects the artist's first-hand experience of classical sculpture. Despite the inherent suspense of the narrative, the picture itself lacks dramatic tension. Abraham's massive red tunic serves as a foil for Isaac's unblemished adolescent body, shifting the emphasis to the work's more lascivious characteristics. When the picture was criticised for its sexually evocative content by a visitor to Arrigoni's villa, the cardinal made an eloquent defence of the artist and the painting.

The allegorical content of these works was always obvious, and the pieces of the series did not become separated. The still-life details enumerating many traditional symbols were painted by Jan Brueghel.The amazing increase in the commercial and agricultural product range caused a complete restructuring of people's perception - a change which can be seen very clearly in the numerous paintings and series of paintings on the subject of the Five Senses. Jan Brueghel the Elder's famous variations on this motif - now in the Prado, Madrid - show a number of settings, each of which is associated with the five senses. The dramatic 'unity of character' has been divided into components of the senses, thus reflecting an increasing compartmentalization of the world into functional spheres - a world which is defined in terms of luxury goods.In Jan Brueghel's paintings, the part of purely passive reception or physical consumption is played by an allegorical female figure. Interestingly, by depicting her naked or semi-naked breasts and sometimes her entire body, the painter emphasizes an element of eroticism. In this way the consumption of luxury goods and an emotional state of ecstasy are recognized as a syndrome.In the still-life of Hearing we can examine nearly all the instruments of the period. Near the Flemish harpsichord we can see a drum, a trumpet, a trombone, a cornetto, a lysard, several flutes, various sizes of violas and gambas, a lute, and a shawm. On a table to the right are a small horn, a trumpet, a bell and a reed pipe. The title of the musical score reveals that it is a six-part madrigal dedicated to Prince Pietro Philippi Albert and to Princess Isabella. The rifle, leaned against the chair, is rendered as a sound-producing implement, along with the other musical instruments used during a hunt; it does not unequivocally refer to Mars, as it has been proposed. In this painting the clock is not the symbol of transitoriness, rather it is a musical clock, several versions of which are visible in the right background. The talking and singing birds were also included on account of their voices. In the hall opening from the left rear, members of a musical group are entertaining themselves. The pictures on the wall of the room also refer to music: they depict the concert of the gods and Orpheus taming the wild animals with his music. The triptych showing the Annunciation and the announcement to the shepherds depicted on the inside cover of the harpsichord are also episodes which can be associated with sound.The nude female figure is, according to some opinions, Euterpe, the Muse of music, while others see her as Venus. The goddess of love may indeed be looked for in a painting associated with the human senses. Such supposition is supported by the presence of a little cherub (Amor?) in four of the five pictures, although he is only depicted as a winged Amor in the allegories of Touch and Sight.As an animal famous for its keen hearing, the stag became the symbol for this sense.

Several alternative suggestions were proposed, the authorship being connected to the Antwerp Mannerists or to the artists contributing to the Grimani Breviary. Presently the right wing is attributed to Jan Gossart.The left panel is attributed to Gerard David. This attribution is supported by recent technical examination. More than any other Bruges painter, David inherited Jan van Eyck's legacy. The left panel of the diptych is an adaptation of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church.

Jehan Braque died soon afterwards, in 1452; his young widow, who did not marry again till 1461, must have commissioned this triptych in his memory.The Braque Triptych ranks among Rogier van der Weyden's most celebrated works. It is a small-scale work of the kind that were set upon portable altars in the oratories of wealthy individuals. When closed, it shows the classical vanity theme, a skull and a cross. Open, it displays images of Christ in the centre, and to either side - the Virgin, St John the Evangelist, St John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene. They are represented against a landscape that is rendered down to the finest detail, with its rivers and mountains, grass and leaves so precisely drawn they could almost be counted and tiny figures visible in the distance in the streets of imaginary towns - a favourite motif of the Flemish masters.Pictures showing busts of Christ and the Virgin had existed earlier north of the Alps, but a sequence of several saints shown half length seems to derive from a type of altarpiece found in Italy from the 13th century onward. The innovation is to place them in front of a wide, coherent landscape relating to the figures themselves not realistically, but in context. It stands for the entire world ruled by Christ and to which He descended incarnate as man, as described at the beginning of the Gospel of St John: \"\"And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.\"\" If the dark exterior was a reminder of the inevitability of death, the wide, radiant interior with its saintly figures allowed the devout viewer to hope for salvation.Artistically, the triptych is very close to the Beaune Altarpiece. The head of the Virgin Mary, and in particular the head of Christ, are so like their counterparts in the picture of the Last Judgment that they must have been executed from the same cartoon (full-size design for a painting). It is not certain whether the work is entirely by Rogier's hand; the underdrawing reveals thin lines not at all typical of him, and perhaps done with a pen instead of Rogier's usual brush.

According to a document (which is a copy of old records of the painters' guild, dating from around 1482, that is to say some 50 years later) a certain Jacques Daret was an \"\"apprentice\"\" in the workshop at about the same time as Rogier van der Weyden; he joined it on 12 April 1427 and became a master on 18 October 1432. We do know, however, that Daret had already been working with Campin for over ten years, so he must have learned his trade as a painter long before 1427; the description \"\"apprenticeship\"\" cannot therefore be correct for him at this period. We may assume that both Daret and Van der Weyden completed their real apprenticeship earlier and they must have worked together in Campin's workshop around 1430 as trained painters.Four paintings executed by Campin's pupil Jacques Daret in 1434-35 for Jean du Clercq, abbot of St. Vaast in Arras, are extant and are unusually well documented. They originally ornamented the wings of an altar shrine decorated with alabaster sculptures.

One reason for this diversity was Rome's prominence as a place of artistic and educational pilgrimage for young artists and travellers from other European nations undertaking the 'Grand Tour'.The painting probably depicts a foreign visitor to Rome proudly holding a book, a prop suggestive of both learning and the implicit educational function of travel in the mid-eighteenth century.The portrait is illustrative of both the distinctive Roman style and mode of 'Grand Tour' portraiture", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 499, "text": "a foreign visitor to Rome"}], "question": "Who does the painting probably depict proudly holding a book?", "id": "56676"}]}, {"context": "The scenes on the east wall are the following: St Benedict Departs the Monastery of Vicovaro (top left, scene 7 of the cycle), St Benedict Accepts Maurus and Placidus as Disciples (top right, scene 8), St Benedict's Prayer Enables the Monks to Lift the Stone on Which the Devil Is Sitting (bottom left, scene 12), St Benedict Recognizes the Sword Bearer Riggo Disguised as King Totila (bottom right, scene 14)", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"Inscription in the top left by someone else (?): OSWOLT KREL 1499.This portrait comes from the collection of the Princes Oettingen-Wallerstein, who had acquired it in 1812; if has been in its present location since 1928. It is presumed that Oswolt Krell, a merchant for the Ravensburg House in Nuremberg from 1495 to 1503, had asked the artist for a true portrait of representation. Its notable size, similar to that adopted by D\ufffdrer for the portrait of his father two years earlier, and its setting, a half-length, suggests this. In this way, it differs from the Tucher portraits, which were intended for private use.The background, as in the Tucher portraits (Schlossmuseum, Weimar), is divided between the curtain and landscape passage, unlike those, however, it is divided rather unevenly. The bright red curtain is wide and occupies most of the space on the right; the landscape, on the left, is reduced to a foreshortening that shows a small part of a river that meanders toward the back, behind a group of tall trees. The windowsill that separated the subject from the landscape in the Tucher paintings is absent. The figure represented, set with obvious grandiosity, is found in front of the curtain, highlighted by intense colour.The large fur-lined cloak is casually placed on the right shoulder only, to show, on the left side, the rich black garment with the puffed sleeve. To the disorderly folds of the cloak correspond the parallel horizontal folds of the sleeve and the vertical ones of the garment. The three-quarter position allows the painter to bring out the quality of the attire: the fur, silk shirt, and gold chain. The careful, fastidious representation of these meaningful details creates a powerful foundation for the setting of the head: vigorous, strong features, the pronounced nose and the strong-willed mouth, the furrowed eyebrows, as if from a sudden start or fright that makes him direct his gaze off to the side behind him. Everything works to make his face threateningly severe, which even the soft, light brown hair framing him does not attenuate. To the energetic expression of the face corresponds the nervous look of his left hand clutching his cloak and that of the contraction of the knotted fingers of the right hand that leans on an invisible window sill.Colour, form, and proportion heighten the expression of supreme resolution, an expression that is the result of a serious psychological study that D\ufffdrer conducted on the merchant, who was the same age as the artist and who was later to become the mayor of Lindau, his native city.The two side panels that represent two \"\"sylvan men\"\" are wings to the portrait.

He and his pupils and assistants produced altarpieces and numerous smaller works for private devotion. One of his chief patrons was the Augustinian nunnery of Mari&#235;npoel just north of Leiden. Among the works he made for the convent church were altarpieces with the Lamentation (c. 1508) and the Crucifixion (c. 1517), which were described by Karel van Mander in 1604 and are now in Leiden's Museum de Lakenhal.The Amsterdam painting undoubtedly comes from an altarpiece illustrating episodes from the life of the Virgin. It was recognised as Engelbrechtsz.'s work in 1904, and shortly afterwards the Rijksmuseum was able to acquire a second, less well-preserved panel from the same altarpiece: Christ in the House of Martha and Mary.The events depicted in the two panels are not found in the Bible but in the popular late-medieval Meditationes vitae Christi. Both scenes precede the Arrest of Christ. In the conversation with his mother and Mary Magdalen, Christ refused to abandon his planned visit to Jerusalem during the Jewish Passover, and foretold his impending death.The second panel shows Christ taking leave of his mother, immediately before he and his disciples set off for Jerusalem. Movingly he embraces the kneeling Virgin amidst the sorrowful Marys and the apostles. Some of the disciples are descending into the valley on the right, with the city gate and walls of Jerusalem in the distance.The attribution of the panels to Engelbrechtsz., based partly on the correspondences in style, colouring and manner of execution with the Crucifixion triptych in Leiden, was recently confirmed by an examination of the two underdrawings using infrared reflectography. This painting is a fine example of the artist's more mature work. The poses and gestures in the figure group highlight the emotional nature of the leave-taking. The landscape and city in the background are painted in a surprisingly lively way. The steely, blue-white shapes of the mountains and rock formations contrast with the warm, bright colouring of the figures in the foreground.

This series has its finest expression in the Crucifix that Cimabue painted for Santa Croce in around 1287-88.

Likewise, Simone and Machilone render anatomic details less schematically than their prototype. From Giunta, on the other hand, the artists inherit the languid abandon of the dead body of Christ, which they interpret with perfect mastery.

He described the principal character of the painting as 'a Mad Meg pillaging at the mouth of Hell / seemingly perplexed / and cruelly and strangely attired', an evil and fearsome woman or witch. Van Mander remained vague about the actual significance of the painting. Perhaps it had already been forgotten by his time. We can be certain, however, that Bruegel gave the work a hidden allegorical or religious meaning, albeit one that remains a mystery. A great many experts have devoted their energies to solving the problem, but none has ever succeeded entirely in explaining the painting. Most of them focus on the possible symbolism of the large woman in the foreground, with her suit of armor, sword, cutlery and money-box. She has been variously interpreted as a symbol of heresy or violence, the personification of hum,an evil and an allegory of instability.Recently it was proposed that Meg symbolizes Madness, a vice taken in the 16th century to include insanity, rage, gluttony, lust, avarice and ambition, and that the giant figure in the centre of the painting is an allegory of Folly. The additional scenes surrounding the two figures illustrate the causes and repercussions of these two human failings. It was concluded that Bruegel's allegory was intended as an attack on both human nature and the political and religious situation in 16th-century Antwerp.We could fill a book with suggested interpretations of Mad Meg and it is highly doubtful whether it would bring the viewer any closer to the true meaning of the painting. Nevertheless, the work never fails to fascinate, even without specialist knowledge. No one can fail to appreciate its apocalyptic vision. For that reason, it has also been plausibly interpreted as the Breaking of the Seventh Seal, as recounted in the Book of Revelations.

Scenes of plunder and battle were depicted but the ancient battle of sexes, where the field of action was a room in an inn or a barrack, and in which the outcome of the struggle is not much in doubt, was more frequently represented. Other popular subjects were soldiers drinking, smoking and gambling at cards or tric-trac, activities that contemporary predicants and moralists condemned as vices that endanger salvation. But it is doubtful if the painters of these scenes and their clients viewed them as pictorial reminders of the perils of sin and the inexorable need to lead a virtuous life. Pictures of the life of off-duty soldiers were called by the Dutch 'cortegaardjes' a corruption of the French term 'corps de garde'. The better ones show little movement or overt action. Painters of them had a special feeling for tonal values and their pictures take on a certain still-life quality. In their half-dark interiors the light glitters over uniforms, and a fine subdued play of colours, mostly broken and harmonized by delicate half-tones, betrays the Dutch gift for intimate pictorial qualities and a subtle rendering of textures. Some even anticipate the achievement of the high society painters of the following generation, when well-to-do burghers rather than soldiers and their friends became the favoured subject of genre painters. Specialists in this category worked in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Delft, but seldom in Haarlem. The leading ones in Amsterdam were Willem Duyster and Pieter Codde.What sets Duyster's rare pictures apart from those made by his contemporaries is his distinct chiaroscuro and the refinement of his colours. He was also better able than any of them to convey the fascinating visual drama which can take place  when people do little more than confront each other. It is difficult to think of a painter of his time who surpasses his penetrating characterization of the personalities of the men gathered round a fireplace in the modest nocturnal scene in the Soldiers beside a Fireplace in the Philadelphia museum. (Versions are also in the Hermitage, and in D\ufffdsseldorf.)  Duyster's approach is always original.

This tower was known as the Torre de la Parada, and Philip, who was particularly fond of it, extended it to make a comfortable hunting lodge. He was in haste to see it furnished, and commissioned Rubens to provide a large collection of new pictures on mythological subjects.After 1638, when the building itself was completed, it was the task of Vel\ufffdzquez to decide how they should be hung, and to contribute a series of hunting portraits himself, to hang with other appropriate works already in existence and with pictures by Dutch masters.

Don Fernando, the king's younger brother, despite his spiritual calling, did not hesitate to indulge his passion for hunting. In this painting, showing him with his gun at the ready, he looks even more of a huntsman than his relations. His expressive outline balances the silhouette of the cinnamon-coloured dog sitting in front of him, a figure once again illustrating the court painter's skill in depicting animals.

The background shows the scene of the banquet in which Salome's mother, Herodias, stabs the decapitated head of the Baptist in her hatred for him.The shallow zone of the foreground is set off by the strong effects of depth in the side panels, where the rooms are almost like tunnels. This makes the narrative backgrounds of the left and right panels subordinate. In the beheading of the Baptist, the body of the executed man is part of the foreground group, and the executioner can set his sword against John's right shoulder, shown in a flat plane.

She and the executioner are turning away from each other and from their victim, as if painfully conscious of the crime that has been committed.Interestingly, however, the figure of Salome looks like a variant on the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation scene of the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), where the figure's knees are placed apart in an even more balletic position. Rogier was obviously able to make effective use of this elaborate and artificial pose in various circumstances, and only the worldly magnificence of Salome's dress and the context cause the viewer to assess it differently here. In addition, Salome's grave and melancholy face does not in fact differ much from the face of the Virgin Mary in that Annunciation, although in this later version it is leaning at rather too pronounced an angle to express grace.

The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and drapes that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background. This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Piet&#224; or Lamentation over the Dead Christ. The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap. The Virgin, visibly distraught, and perhaps on the point of fainting, still glazes longingly towards her Son, and gestures with her right arm in the same direction. In the centre of the painting, the moment of the separation is underlined by the subtle contact of Mary's legs with those of Christ, now freed from his Mother's last pathetic embrace. The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Piet&#224; (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin. Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father. The general direction of the movement is, in fact, a rising one, and is created by the ethereal quality of the weightless figures, and their slow, almost dance-like rhythm. The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens. The transparent shadows do not annul the colours, but actually become them, in the flesh tones invested with subtle shades of pink and green.The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself.

The altarpiece the Adoration of the Shepherds is the chapel 's key work  not only in subject, but also in artistic merit. This composition was so successful that other artists frequently repeated it. Ghirlandaio himself appears in the scene, dressed as a shepherd. He is even allowed to come closer to the Christ Child than the donors, who appear in frescoes to the right and left, praying outside the confines of the panel. The artist, who is leading the shepherds, is kneeling and bringing the miracle of the birth of Christ to the attention of both the shepherds and the observers of the picture. His left hand, with which he is pointing to the Christ Child, is finely drawn and is superbly modelled in three dimensions. With his right hand, his painting hand, he is pointing to his chest, as he does in a later fresco in the Tornabuoni Chapel. As Ghirlandaio is pointing both at the child and the garlands on the Roman marble sarcophagus, it is possible that the gesture is saying: \"\"This holy child was painted for you by me, the garland-maker Ghirlandaio.\"\"The classical sarcophagus in the picture is not just a manger for the ox and ass. It also has an iconographical significance indicated by the Latin inscription along its front: Ense cadens. Solymo. Pompei Pului[us] Augur Numen. Ait. Quae me conteg[it] Urna Dabit. [While Fulvi(us), augur of Pompey, was falling by the sword in Jerusalem he said: the urn that covers (conceals) me shall bring forth a god]. This is an ancient prophecy by Fulvius. The animals' manger will serve as a crib for the Christ Child. In his Adoration of the Shepherds, Ghirlandaio combines this reference to the Roman classical age with knowledge of Flemish art and turns them into an integrated whole.An historic event that took place a few years before this work was painted clearly left its mark behind on Ghirlandaio's work. An altarpiece ordered by Tommaso Portinari from Hugo van der Goes in Bruges reached Florence in May 1483. Florentine artists saw van der Goes' Adoration of the Shepherds as a shining comet showing new ways of painting.

The popes' \"\"captivity in Babylon\"\" had terminated, but Avignon continued to act as a channel through which Italian Gothic art gradually penetrated further and further into the rest of Europe. It was in Avignon that Luis Borrass\ufffd first came into contact with 'court' Gothic, in the period around 1400, when this style was widely adopted in numbers of countries; it became in fact an international style founded upon all that Borrass\ufffd has learned from the brothers Serra.The painting in the church of Santa Maria in Terrasa illustrates the text from St. Matthew: 'And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. And he saith unto them: Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. And they straightway left their nets, and followed him' (4, 19-20). This scene is connected with another one from the Gospel: 'Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship... the ship was now in the midst of the sea... Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled... And Peter said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?' (Matthew 15, 22-31). Christ's face and his gesture are very beautiful, but the figures of both Christ and the two disciples are still stereotyped, differing in size in the traditional manner of early religious paintings: on the other hand, his treatment of the fishermen, particularly the one who is rowing, testifies to his own acute observation and his ability to make use of it.This altarpiece manifests a mixture of archaic technique and new characteristics of the International Gothic.

Following the path opened up by his uncle, he responded to the growing demand of a prosperous bourgeoisie that wished to decorate their houses with works that reflected the lay character of their surroundings, whilst retaining a moral and religious significance.Jesus' visit to the house of Martha and Mary, taken from St Luke's Gospel, formed the basis of several representations from the mid-16th century onwards. In the religious context of the time, this scene illustrated one of the fundamental differences opposing Catholics and Protestants. The latter sought salvation in action whilst the former placed greater value on the contemplative life. Here the artist relegates the teaching of the divine word to the back of the painting, devoting the entire foreground to active life, incarnated by Martha, and in so doing juxtaposing a genre scene and a still-life. Like Aertsen, he assembles the domestic scene in his studio, drawing from a repertory of standard objects and utensils that he was to constantly reproduce elsewhere in various combinations. Again like Aertsen, he has borrowed from Serlio's treatise the Renaissance architecture in which he places his composition.However, it would be unfair to dismiss Beuckelaer as a mere follower. Rather the artist stands out by his extraordinary ability to reproduce textures in their full sensuousness, using a light and subtle stroke and a delicately gradated palette. With considerable virtuosity and delight he precisely depicts the varnished terracotta of the crocks, the flaccid skin of the plucked fowl, the starched but still supple serviettes, and the fragility of the hair drawn back over the kitchen-maid's temples. The soft greasiness of the meat or the velvety softness of the mallard duck are set against the flat glint of the tin pot and the glazed transparency of the cabochon glasses or berkemeier. A search for harmony guides him in the distribution of objects, colours, light and shade, in a careful composition that leaves nothing to chance.Multiplying the different levels of interpretation, the image moves beyond a simple illustration of the Gospel story to become a philosophical exegesis of visible reality.

The so-called Jewish Bride of c. 1665, which may be a commissioned portrait of a couple in the guise of a biblical pair (such as Isaac and Rebecca), belongs to his most brilliant colouristic creations. Even in reproductions it is possible to see something of the fluctuating quality of his late paint, the vibrations of the tones, and the harmonious fusion of the whole; but they can hardly suggest the warmth of the fiery scarlets, the golden yellows, the delicate blues and olives, the powerful whites, and deep blacks of his late palette. The broad, calm, relief-like arrangement of the life-size half-figures recalls a certain type of Venetian Renaissance painting. This reveals a touch of classical taste, but the use of colour in the portrait is quite unclassical.Like The Night Watch, this is another misnamed masterpiece by Rembrandt which it would be insensitive to re-title. To be sure, the painting does not represent a Jewish bridal couple in the sense which the nineteenth century, which invented the title, would have had in mind. The picture would then have been regarded as a romantic costume-piece, its very strangeness and aura of secretiveness suggesting that it showed some exotic rite, which was outside the experience of a predominantly Christian society.There can be no doubt, however, that an intimate relationship between the two figures was intended by the artist. The man places his hand on the woman's breast, while she moves instinctively to protect her modesty, in the classic pose of the Venus pudica which Rembrandt would have known from engravings or casts of classical statues. Yet the couple show every sign of tenderness towards each other, so this is not a common seduction scene (a frequent enough subject in Dutch painting). The theme most widely favoured by modern scholars is Isaac embracing his wife Rebecca while they were being spied on by Abimelech (Genesis, Chapter XXVI), which Rembrandt had previously represented in a drawing. To summarize the Bible narrative, Isaac, staying in the land of the Philistines, passes off Rebecca as his sister, because, if the Philistines had wanted to seduce her and had known she was Isaac's wife, they would have felt obliged to kill him first. One day, Abimelech, the Philistine King, observes the couple from a window making love in secret and guesses the truth, namely that they are man and wife. He reproves Isaac for the deception, pointing out that any man might have lain with Rebecca in all innocence, not realizing she was a married woman, and would thus have brought dishonour on himself and his people", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 291, "text": "of a couple in the guise of a biblical pair"}], "question": "What may c. 1665 be a commissioned portrait of?", "id": "57375"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2096, "text": "by Abimelech"}], "question": "Who were modern scholars being spied on by?", "id": "57376"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 267, "text": "a commissioned portrait of a couple in the guise of a biblical pair"}], "question": "What may c. 1665 be?", "id": "57377"}]}, {"context": "The artist painted in Toledo and Madrid.

Together with the leaders of public, charitable and professional associations, the civic guard societies were the main patrons to commission group portraits. This patronage took on considerable proportions in the course of the century. These group portraits are also of value as historical documents, for which lists were drawn up giving the names of the figures portrayed. The paintings themselves were displayed prominently on the premises of the respective association.These civic guard portraits were an expression of the Baroque will to representation, whose tradition is rooted in the medieval era. There had been civic guards in the Netherlands since the 13th century. They had played an important role in the emancipation of the cities and towns from feudal rule and had gained considerable political and military significance in the Netherlands' struggle for independence.Cornelis van Haarlem had already painted the officers of the St George Civic Guard in 1599. Hals, however, revolutionizes this type of painting. Instead of merely painting a row of individual portraits, he places them within a specific context by creating a banquet scene. This is not simply a moment captured at a table, but an extremely witty and calculated composition in which a scenic context is created between all the figures involved, and, on the other hand, each of the figures poses and acts independently and individually. Hals has found a new and persuasive solution to the problem of portraying a large group without difference of rank.Hals seems to have arranged the officers casually around the festive board. But this is not the case. The places they occupy are in strict accord with military protocol. The colonel, the company's highest ranking officer, is seated at the head of the table; at his right is the provost, the second ranking officer.

His renown extended well beyond the frontiers of his country, and in 1621 Marie de M\ufffddicis, widow of Henri IV of France and mother of the reigning king Louis XIII, invited him to Paris. She wished him to decorate one of the galleries of the newly built Palais de Luxembourg with 24 monumental paintings commemorating episodes in the lives of herself and her renowned husband. The creation of a cycle of tapestries had, in a sense, been Rubens' technical apprenticeship for this demanding task, the composition of a cycle of vast narrative paintings dedicated to a living queen who had already entered history.Giving epic treatment to this biographical subject, Rubens was also able to give free rein to his fertile invention. He prepared two series of oil sketches, with detailed figures drawn in, which it then fell to his assistants to scale up to the dimensions of the canvases commissioned. These were then meticulously retouched by the master so that they might be ultimately be described, at least in the final layers of paint, as his own works. The entire commission was completed in only three years.All of his prodigious culture was drawn on for these works: his encyclopaedic knowledge of classical mythology was exploited to the full in transforming the queen's entire career - Henri slipped rather into the background - into a kind of operatic sequence largely of Rubens' own invention. Metamorphosing life into myth, he freely mingled historical personages with the gods of Olympus, who came to represent them. The scheme of this apparatus was invented as he went along, the - often gratuitous - interpolations of the divine gracefully leavening the uneventful royal life. It had required all of Rubens' imaginative resources and natural verve to ennoble and illustrate the relatively colourless circumstances of the Queen Mother's life. These qualities were essential; Rubens' international renown depended on his success in this formidable commission. His solution was to populate his compositions with nude goddesses, pagan gods, curvaceous undines, mischievous tritons, and genii unspecified. His customary contrasts are at work in the playful opposition of gleaming cuirasses and lusty bodies, fragile silks and the rugged hulls of dreadnoughts. The poverty of his subject was utterly transcended; this is pure painting, nothing but painting.Certainly, it was not the rather heavy features of the Medici family, particularly evident in the queen, that had attracted Henri IV, but the scale of her dowry. Rubens nevertheless contrived to render her portrait agreeable. He disguised her now as an attractive Bellona, now as a proud horsewoman in The Capture of Juliers.

Ruisdael's rare ability to create a compelling and tragic mood in nature is best seen in his famous Jewish Cemetery at Dresden. A larger, more elaborate autograph version is at the Detroit Institute of Arts. These works are moralizing landscapes that were painted with a deliberate allegorical programme. The combination of their conspicuous tombs, ruins, large dead beech trees, broken trunks, and rushing streams alludes to the familiar themes of transience and the vanity of life and the ultimate futility of human endeavour, while the burst of light that breaks through the ravening clouds in each painting, their rainbows and the luxuriant growth that contrasts with the dead trees offer a promise of hope and renewed life.The masterliness of the Dresden painting lies in the artist's clear and concentrated presentation of these ideas. The eye focuses on the three tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized. They present a truthful picture of the actual, identifiable sarcophagi as they can still be seen in the Portuguese-Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk on the Amstel River near Amsterdam. Ruisdael made carefully worked-up drawings of the tombs, one of which he used as a preparatory drawing for the paintings. But the landscape settings of the Dresden and Detroit paintings bear no resemblance whatsoever to the site at Ouderkerk. They are Ruisdael's inventions. The cemetery never had monumental ruins. Those seen in the Dresden version were transplants from the shattered remains of Egmond Castle near Alkmaar, a site about forty kilometres from Ouderkerk; they also are based on a preparatory drawing. The ruins seen in the Detroit painting are probably derived from the ruins of Egmond's old Abbey Church. A rushing stream does not bisect the actual burial ground. (Would anyone in his right mind place tombs near a vigorous stream which would wreak havoc with the tombstones and coffins beneath them when it flooded?) The stream was included as a traditional allusion to the passage of time. Most remarkable is the barren beech tree in the Dresden picture that gestures toward the three tombs and heavenwards. If ever a tree was capable of seducing a viewer to accept the pathetic fallacy of endowing natural forms with human feelings and emotions it is this dead beech.The iconographical programme of Ruisdael's two versions of the Jewish Cemetery leaves no doubt that they were intended as moralizing landscapes. He made no others that can be given a similar unmistakable reading. None of his other existing paintings include tombs; those done by his contemporaries are rare, and some of them are based on his depictions of the sarcophagi at Ouderkerk. However, Ruisdael made numerous pictures that include identifiable or imaginary ruins, dead and broken trees, rushing streams, rivers, and waterfalls. Were these motifs invariably intended by the artist as symbols of transience and the vanity of life, and does the handful of them that include rainbows allude to hope? It has been argued that this is indeed the case, and that these motifs not only offer the iconographical essence of Ruisdael's landscapes but offer the key to the meaning to seventeenth-century landscape painting.

The subject is taken from the Apocryphal Book of Tobit (Chapter II, vv, 11-14). Tobit was a wealthy, God-fearing Jew, strict in his observance of the Mosaic law, who had lost all his money and been blinded in an accident. To keep them from starving, his wife Anna took in sewing and washing. One day, hearing the bleating of a kid which Anna had been given to supplement her earnings, Tobit falsely accuses her of having stolen it. In return, she upbraids him for his self-righteousness which has brought them to their present plight (this is the scene represented in the picture). Later, however, the couple's fortunes are restored by their son, Tobias, who goes to find the money his father has lost and to marry a rich wife. On the way he meets the Angel Raphael, who instructs him when they come to a river to catch a large fish, the entrails of which are afterwards applied to Tobit's eyes to cure his blindness.In this work Rembrandt depicts the psychological tension between the two protagonists. The mood of the blind old Tobit suddenly becomes one of suspicion and despair when he wonders how his wife, Anna, has managed to lay hands on a kid. She in turn is baffled by his mistrust.The space depicted is confined but packed with domestic detail: onions hanging up by the window, a basket on the wall, cooking utensils on the shelves, part of Anna's sewing apparatus glimpsed between the two figures, and, in the foreground, Tobit's stick, his dog and a modest fire.Such meticulously painted still-life detail had been a characteristic of Netherlandish art since the fifteenth century.

The group of fourteen paintings, broken up at the end of the 16th century, was contained within a wooden decoration made by Baccio d'Agnolo.In this panel the thesis proposed by Mannerism is fully elaborated: the painter is no longer to be bound by perspective, or by the necessity of presenting his subject in a rational, objective manner. He may use light and colour, chiaroscuro and proportion as he pleases; he may borrow from any source he chooses; the only obligation upon him is to create an interesting design, expressive of the ideas inherent in the subject, and the various parts need bear no relationship to each other. The colour must be evocative and beautiful in itself.This work, traditionally entitled Joseph in Egypt, depicts the most significant episodes of Joseph reuniting with his family of origin. The painting is divided into four distinct zones. In the left foreground Joseph presents his family, who he invited to move to Egypt, to the pharaoh; according to Vasari, the boy with dark cloak and brown tunic sitting on the first step of the stairs on which the figures are arranged, is a portrait of the young Bronzino. On the right, Joseph is seen sitting on a triumphal cart pulled by three putti; hoisting himself up with his left arm and clutching firmly onto a putto with the other, he bends toward a kneeling figure who is presenting him a petition or reading him a message; a fifth putto, wrapped in a piece of cloth blown by the wind, dominates the scene from the top of a column, appearing to mime the gesture of one of the two half-living statues represented in the top left and centre of the painting. A restless crowd, curious to see what is going on, throngs the adjacent space between the two buildings in the background. Other mysterious figures, resting against one of the large boulders that dominate the landscape, turn their attention toward the action in the foreground.The clothes, expressions and features of all these figures are inspired by northern European painting, as is the large castle and surrounding trees depicted in the background. On the unrailed staircase of the imposing cylindrical building to the right, Joseph takes one of his children by the hand; higher up, the other is greeted affectionately by his mother.

It may perhaps be identifiable with the Magdalene cited with an attribution to Sacchi in the 1648-49 inventory of the Palazzo Barberini at Monterotondo.The painting, which shows some stylistic and typological connections with the Vouet's David in Palazzo Bianco in Genoa, could date from the years (c. 1623-27) in which the French artist was in close contact with the Barberini, ending with his departure for France. Though the canvas is certainly rich in Caravaggesque qualities, Vouet is already showing himself as a full participant in the new classicism that was on the rise in the Roman art scene. At the same time he also shows signs of sympathy with the first fully baroque works that were being created in Rome.This painting poses interesting problems on account of its close compositional connections to the Magdalene by Guido Reni, dated to 1631-32 (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome). The cut of the scene anticipates the composition that Vouet adopted for his Portrait of Gaucher de Chatillon (Louvre, Paris), carried out for the Palace of Cardinal Richelieu between 1633 and 1634. Dominated by the monumental figure of the Magdalene, the picture opens out to a luxuriant perspectival landscape view in the left background. Another highly interesting element is the close stylistic analogy between the Magdalene and Vouet's Allegory of Peace, that was also in the Barberini collection (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome).

They were intended for a room in his ch&#226;teau in Poitou which would also house mythological pictures by Mantegna, Perugino and Costa. Poussin must have been advised about the scale not only of the canvases but also of the figures, for although he never saw the Renaissance paintings his personages are much the same size as theirs. He must also have been told that the pictures were to be set above a high dado, divided by gilt caryatids, gold fleur-de-lys against a blue ground, and marine battles, all under a gilt ceiling.The Cabinet de la Chambre du Roy in Richelieu's ch&#226;teau celebrated the cardinal's 'gift' to Louis XIII of mastery of the seas. The room, with its 'Combat of Wealth and Art', as a contemporary panegyric puts it, and furnished in addition to paintings and panelling with porphyry vases and ancient busts, must have presented a formidable challenge to Poussin. Not only would he be competing with some of the foremost Italian Renaissance artists, his pictures also had to contend with the glittering d\ufffdcor - hence the colours here are among the most brilliant he ever lavished on a painting. Sadly, the room was dismantled long ago and the pictures dispersed, so we can judge the full effect only in our mind's eye.Poussin carefully allowed for the spectator's point of view. Nimble visitors to the Gallery can sit on the floor to look at this picture in order better to appreciate its spatial construction, and thus its full significance. The revellers occupy a raised stage extending back to where rocks and vine-hung trees screen off the backdrop of sky and distant mountains. Propped up vertically against this earthen stage are a timbrel and two masks - an ancient satyr mask and a modern Italian Columbine. Behind them a Punchinello mask joins a still life drawn from the imagery of ancient bacchanals: thyrsoi - staffs wreathed with ivy and surmounted by pine cones - the crooked stick and pipes of Pan, wine in a metal bowl or crater, and a Greek wine jar showing the god Dionysus, the Roman Bacchus.The composition is indebted to an engraving after Giulio Romano, a pupil of Raphael, but Poussin also demonstrates his first-hand access to antiquarian lore. The mixture of modern and ancient masks, and the stage-like construction, allude to the origins of theatre in bacchic rites. The main scene represents the 'triumph' or worship of the armless bust of a horned deity mounted on a pillar, his face smeared red with the juice of boiled ivy stems. This is the 'term' of Pan, Arcadian god of shepherds and herdsmen, and Priapus, a phallic god of fertility, protector of gardens, whose cult was imported into Greece from the Near East. Confused with each other, both were associated with Dionysus/Bacchus: Dionysus, god of the grape-vine, who died, descended into Hades then rose again was himself identified with seasonal decay and rebirth. All the participants are members of his entourage (as we find them in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne): nymphs and their lewd playmates the satyrs; maenads who rend deer limb from limb or strew flowers from the winnowing basket sacred to Dionysus.

The human eye can hardly appreciate the infinitely delicate precision of the tender, thread-like stems and little twigs winding around the jumble of the painstakingly detailed fruits.

It is said to have been begun by Jan's elder brother Hubert, of whom little is known, and was completed by Jan in 1432. On the frame a quatrain is inscribed which states that the polyptych was begun by Pictor Hubertus Eyck, and finished by his brother Jan, at the request of Jodocus Vijd, deputy burgomaster of Ghent, warden of the church of St John, and of his wife, Elisabeth Borluut, who commissioned it. The verse was placed there when the altarpiece was installed on 6 May 1432.The stylistic analysis reveals that in the painting the work of two different hands can be clearly discerned. The overall conception of the altarpiece is the work of Hubert, along with the execution of certain parts, such as the panels in the lower tier. Here, the manner is archaic, and reflects the continuing dominance of the international style that was practised by Broederlam. The composition is typically unoriginal: the landscape is still conceived as a distant background, with which the figures at the front have no organic relation, an effect that is reinforced by the bird's eye point of view.This polyptych is mystical, not to say esoteric, in intention, and is imbued throughout with both spiritual and intellectual signification. When opened, it represents the communion of saints, which is \"\"the new heaven and the new earth\"\", in the words of the Revelation of St John. Thus the central panel of the lower tier portrays the saints symbolizing the eight Beatitudes gathered round the altar where the sacrifice of the Lamb is taking place, at the centre of the heavenly garden which has sprung from His blood.To left and right, in the foreground, are two processions facing one another. One of these is made up of the Old Testament patriarchs and prophets, and the other of figures from the New Testament. Some of them are kneeling, barefoot. Behind them is assembled the hierarchy of the Church - popes, deacons and bishops, wearing sumptuous jewelry and clothes in the bright red of martyrdom. In the background are two further groups, facing each other as if they had just emerged from the surrounding shrubbery. These are, on one side, the Confessors of the Faith, tightly packed together and almost all dressed in blue; and on the other side, the Virgin Martyrs, holding out palm fronds and wearing in their hair crowns of flowers of a kind traditionally worn by young girls at certain holy ceremonies. In the middle of the panel, around the altar where the Lamb spills forth his blood, angels kneel, holding the emblems of His Passion. Grace is symbolized by a radiant dove hovering in the sky, and eternal life is represented by a fountain in the foreground. A paradisiacal landscape runs across all five lower panels, uniting them in a single composition. It is strewn with plants from different countries and flowers of different seasons. The central panel is vibrant with green, while those to the sides are more arid and rocky. The horizon sits high in the frame and is closed off by groves of trees, behind which clusters of fairy-tale buildings can be made out, representing the heavenly Jerusalem.The community of saints also extends onto the side panels. Magnificently arrayed horsemen, representing the Soldiers of Christ, are followed by the Just Judges. Opposite them are the Holy Hermits who have renounced the world, and the Pilgrim Saints, who were favourite figures of identification throughout the Middle Ages. They are led by a giant of a man, St Christopher. Many later commentators have suggested that his great height would have reminded the contemporary viewer of Jodocus Vijd's brother, also called Christopher. In the middle of the upper tier is God Almighty, the Word, essence and origin of the universe. He is dressed in red and is crowned with a magnificent tiara. On his left is Mary and on his right, St John the Baptist. These central figures are surrounded by angels who are singing or playing instruments. At the far right and left of the composition respectively are the figures of Adam and Eve. They were painted by Jan Van Eyck, and are set into trompe-l'oeil niches.

As the old Joachim does not yet have any descendants, he is not allowed to take part in the sacrificial rite, and is sent away. Symmetrical groups of Florentine citizens frame this biblical scene, and in the group on the right, the artist has depicted himself and some members of his family.This episode follows the traditional lines of composition. Of significance here is the architecture, which the artist obviously felt was more important than the events. In the upper half of the painting it takes up more space than the figures, who occupy only the bottom part of the picture. The most important figures - and not only the biblical ones - are standing at the front edge of the picture. All the other scenes follow this basic principle.In the background, Ghirlandaio's depiction of the widely spaced loggia and its medallions is a direct quotation of the Spedale degli Innocenti, the foundling hospital in Florence designed by Brunelleschi.

Comparable buildings, with rusticated lower stories and open upper stories, largely characterize the appearance of Florence to this day. This was one way in which Ghirlandaio repeatedly brought the city into his paintings.Contemporaries of the artist and clients are present as spectators and witnesses of the expulsion of Joachim, and because of their fashionable clothing and shoes and their vain hairstyles they differ conspicuously from the biblical participants. It is thought that the noblemen on the left include the client's son, Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and his friend Piero, the son of Lorenzo de' Medici.

The new type of the hall church evolved following the prototype of the Il Ges&#249; in Rome, and offered fresco painters an ideal space to work in. The vaulted, single-aisle nave flanked by chapels, transepts flooded by light from the centre cupola, and a spacious choir made possible a sophisticated structuring of the pictorial program in conformity with the architecture.The painterly redecoration of the church of Santissima Annunziata del Vastato in Genoa following its modernization in the style of the Counter-Reformation began around 1625 with the vaults of the aisles.

The quay, which is provided with steps and jetties for mooring boats, creates a striking line in the composition running almost at a right angle to the lower edge of the image and leads the eye toward a vanishing point just below the middle of the painting. Depicted at the right is the column of Todaro beyond which the buildings along the Molo continue with the Library, the Zecca and the State Grain Storage Houses all the way to the Fonteghetto della Farina near the entrance of the Grand Canal. A market with simple stalls and awnings occupies the Fondaco del Grano. To the left of the entrance of the Grand Canal can be seen the Punta della Dogana and Santa Maria della Salute and in the distance, to the extreme left, the Redentore. The composition is closed off at this end by a fishing boat which counterbalances the column of Todaro. As several corrections by the painter, visible to the naked eye reveal, Guardi modified the strong perspective of the buildings at the right and moved the Salute closer to the centre of the composition.The view of the Molo in the direction of the entrance to the Grand Canal was a subject frequently depicted in Venetian vedute painting. Initially the view functioned primarily as a setting for festive entries in the Doges' Palace, such as in Luca Carlevaris's Reception of Cardinal Cesar d'Estrees (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Later the view of the Molo was usually shown without the Doges' Palace and without any kind of festivity.For this painting, Guardi undoubtedly drew inspiration from a work by Canaletto (c. 1740, private collection) which he may have known through a print by Antonio Visentini from 1742. Not only did Guardi rely on this for his composition, he also borrowed several details from Canaletto such as the little stalls on the Molo and the gondolas floating on the water. However, a comparison with this source makes it clear that Guardi, despite the strong perspectival arrangement of this composition, neither subjected the cityscape to a strict perspectival system nor strove for an exact, detailed rendering of the architecture. For the loosely, vigorously painted figures on the Molo, Guardi more likely found an example in the work of the Genoese painter, Alessandro Magnasco. Furthermore, Guardi's painting is not even half the size of the one by Canaletto.Guardi's small painting and its pendant, a view of the Piazzetta in the direction of San Giorgio Maggiore (also in the Galleria Franchetti, Venice), no longer satisfied the presumably more representative function of Canaletto's painting, but were purchased instead by an individual client who was as interested in the well-known Venetian cityscapes as in Guardi's painterly rendering of them.As with many of Francesco Guardi's paintings, the dating of this work is problematic. It no longer displays the strong stylistic dependence on Canaletto which is characteristic of his earliest cityscapes, nor the brown tonality of his work from the 1760s. The shimmering effects of light and colour, especially in the wall surfaces of the buildings, and the nervous treatment of the sky and the figures on the Molo are characteristic of Guardi's extremely individualistic, transparent style in the last two decades of his career.

It is a rather exceptional combination of the biblical theme with that of the Virgo inter Virgines.

Nevertheless, it is clearly dedicated to the Virgin and the two St Johns. Together with the Gdansk Last Judgment and the L\ufffdbeck Passion, this is one of the three biggest triptychs that Memling ever painted. The three altarpieces are also distributed evenly throughout his career, and hence serve as crucial milestones in the development of his oeuvre. The St John altarpiece is dated 1479, and is thus located precisely half-way between the Gdansk (1467) and L\ufffdbeck (1491) triptychs.The central panel focuses upon a Sacra Conversazione, a gathering of saints around the Virgin. However, the narrow vertical openings between the columns reveal a continuous landscape with ruins and buildings in which small episodes from the lives of the two male saints are enacted. The two wings each depict episodes from the lives of the standing figures of the two St Johns on either side of the Virgin. The left wing features the Beheading of St John the Baptist and the right wing St John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos. In addition to these realistic portrayals, the carved groups on the two capitals above each saint also depict key moments from their lives.The composition of the triptych as a whole is not only ingenious in narrative terms, with the different components interlocking spatially and thematically; it is also new in many respects as far as the portrayal of the Virgin Mary in heaven and the Apocalypse are concerned. The iconographical forebears of such a grouping of saints sitting and standing around an enthroned Virgin are few and far between. The only extant examples are, in fact, the Virgo inter Virgines from the circle of the Master of Fl\ufffdmalle in Washington and a similar composition, this time set in a room, by Rogier van der Weyden, several fragments of which have survive. They are not, however, comparable in formal terms. This clear monumental composition, with two symmetrical standing male saints and two sitting female saints, forming a tetramorph around the Virgin, must have seemed very new. As is the case with the architecture, Memling appears to have developed here upon Jan van Eyck's Virgin with Canon van der Paele. The Apocalypse is new too. There is no sign of any other representation prior to Memling in which the Book of Revelation is played out before St John's eyes in its entirety in a single, undivided painting. Only in the Beheading of StJohn the Baptist did Memling prefer to paraphrase a Van der Weyden composition (St John altarpiece, Berlin, Staatliche Museen). However, the stylised terseness and enclosed character of the latter give way here to dramatic action in the open air, with a high degree of realism.In view of the historical circumstances and iconography, there can be no doubt whatsoever that this triptych was painted for the High Altar of the chapel of St John's Hospital. An old inscription on the bottom member of the frame gives the date 1479 and the name of the artist Johannes Memling. With the exception of the Floreins triptych in the same hospital, this is the only work by Memling to be authenticated by an original (in this case subsequently overpainted) inscription. The donors were also identified. Jacob de Ceuninc was initially recorded as a monk at the hospital in 1469-70, and later as bursar from 1488 until his death in 1490. Antheunis Seghers was first mentioned in 1455-56 and appears to have been master from 1461 to 1465, bursar from 1466 to 1468, and then master again from 1469 until his death in 1475. Agnes Casembrood was first recorded in 1445-46, and subsequently appears as prioress from 1459 to 1463, and again from 1469 until her death in 1489. Clara van Hulsen makes her initial appearance in the records in 1427-1428, and died in 1479. Given that these are evidently intended as portraits, the altarpiece must have been ordered before the death of Antheunis Seghers in 1475, which means that its production may logically be linked with the expansion of the chapel's apse in 1473- 74 though we lack details of Jacob de Ceuninc and Clara van Hulsen in those years.The altarpiece is, of course, dedicated to the patron saints of St John's Hospital. The central portrayal of the Virgin might relate to the hospital chapel's long-standing and close links with the chapter of the almost adjacent Church of Our Lady. The two female saints, Catherine and Barbara, were frequently invoked in adversity. Their presence in the hospital context has frequently been explained in terms of their symbolising respectively the contemplative and active life of the hospital's monastic community", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 2723, "text": "the stylised terseness and enclosed character of the latter"}], "question": "What give way here to dramatic action in the open air?", "id": "58311"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 4580, "text": "in adversity"}], "question": "What were the two female saints frequently invoked in?", "id": "58312"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2300, "text": "upon Jan van Eyck's Virgin"}], "question": "Who does Memling appear to have developed here upon with Canon van der Paele?", "id": "58313"}]}, {"context": "Mercier is credited with bringing the French style of genre and conversation painting to England.

An almost infinite number of interpretations have now been proposed for the scene it shows. At first sight, however, Las Meninas seems to present no problems at all, and indeed appears perfectly straightforward in its sober geometry and good-humoured clarity.It is set in a room in the Alc\ufffdzar, equipped by Vel\ufffdzquez as a studio, and shows the heiress to the throne, the Infanta Margarita, with her court. Palomino names all those present. The queen's maid of honour, Dona Maria Agustina Sarmiento, one of the meninas, is kneeling at the Infanta's feet, handing her a jug of water. The other maid of honour, Dona Isabel de Velasco stands behind the princess, and beside her we see the grotesquely misshapen female dwarf Mari-B\ufffdrbola and the male dwarf Nicolasico Pertusato; the latter, as Palomino points out, is placing his foot on the mastiff lying in front of the group to demonstrate the lethargic animal's good temper. Further back, almost swallowed up in the shadows, are a man described only as guardadamas - a guard or escort to the ladies - and the lady in waiting Do&#241;a Marcela de Ulloa.Vel\ufffdzquez is standing with brush and palette in front of a tall canvas; we can see only the back of it. There are some large pictures hanging on the back wall of the room. Two of them were painted by Vel\ufffdzquez's son-in-law, Mazo, from models by Rubens, and show scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses, one of them another version of the punishment of Arachne. The princess's parents, the king and queen, appear in a dark frame below these pictures, probably the glass of a mirror. To the right of the mirror, on a flight of steps leading up to a doorway and a brightly lit adjoining room, stands Jose Nieto, the queen's palace marshal.There are several basic questions that have been asked again and again about this picture. What is Vel\ufffdzquez painting on the front of the canvas that is hidden from us? Where did he stand in order to paint the scene and himself in it? What is the source of the image in the mirror - that is, just where in the room must the royal couple have been standing for their reflection to appear? And finally, is there any significance in the fact that the red cross of the Order of Santiago is prominently applied to the artist's clothing?It was long thought that Vel\ufffdzquez was creating a picture without any metaphysical or speculative reference, and was merely recording a fleeting moment in permanent form, as if in a snapshot. According to this theory the subject was no more than an ordinary scene of palace life.A different hypothesis is put forward by art historians, who believe that intellect and keen perspicacity, as well as the artist's eye and hand, were involved in the painting of Las Meninas. The largest number of interpretations have been put forward for the mirror on the back wall, sometimes also thought to be a painted canvas. Much learned industry has also been applied to the question of location: in which room in the palace is this scene taking place? Despite the riddles hidden in the painting of Las Meninas we must not overlook its artistic mastery, particularly as expressed in the figure of the Infanta Margarita surrounded by people of lesser birth.

For the purposes of travel the wings would have closed inwards covering the centre panels and lying flush with the raised spandrel above the inner moulding. The backs of the wings were most probably painted with imitation marble or porphyry, perhaps with decorative motifs, as opposed to narrative scenes. The creation of a work of art of this kind was due to a combination of craftsmanship and painterly skills. Some of the finest surviving examples are Florentine or Sienese in origin. The triptych in the Royal Collection is comparable with examples in the National Gallery in London, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Pinacoteca in Siena, and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all of which, according to varying degrees of attribution, are associated with Duccio or his workshop.The exact attribution of the present triptych is unsettled owing to the multiplicity of hands at work not only in Duccio's workshop as a whole, but even on the surface of individual paintings. The centre panel in particular is of a quality worthy of Duccio himself. The same might almost be said of the lower scenes in each of the wings, certainly in their design even if the actual execution reveals evidence of assistants (for example, the gold decoration on the cloth of honour behind Christ and the Virgin Enthroned, lower right). The inconsistencies apparent in the architecture of Annunciation (top left) or the design of the two thrones are not unknown in Duccio's own work, as revealed in the Maest&#224; of 1308-11 (Siena, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo) with which this triptych is comparable in date or possibly slightly earlier.The iconography of the panels is also significant. Paradoxically, the inner religious consistency is derived from the unusual combination of scenes, especially the pairing of enthroned figures in the lower sections of the wings. The enthronement of the Virgin twice (lower left and lower right), for instance, suggests a temporal sequence before and after Christ's death as represented in the centre. The Annunciation (top left) is comparable with the relevant scene (now in the National Gallery, London) from the Maest&#224;, whereas both Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata (top right) and Christ and the Virgin Enthroned (lower right) recall frescoes in the Upper Church of St Francis, Assisi (the former in the nave from the Life of Saint Francis and the latter, earlier in date and by Cimabue, in the transept). These connotations and the treatment of the crucifixion in a devotional, as opposed to a narrative sense, imply a Franciscan origin for this triptych. The quantity of blood depicted in the central scene (some of it removed in an earlier restoration) is an unusual feature in a work on this scale.Probably before it became part of the Royal Collection the triptych had been dismantled and put in a heavy gothic frame, which was removed when it was cleaned in 1930. After this the triptych was displayed in a shadow box with a simpler frame. This, too, was considered to be inappropriate and the present reconstruction of the triptych was devised in 1988, although further thought has since been given to the angle at which the two wings should be positioned in order to make proper visual sense of the architecture.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1968, "text": "of enthroned figures in the lower sections of the wings"}], "question": "What are scenes the pairing of?", "id": "58537"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 212, "text": "inwards"}], "question": "Who would the wings have closed covering the center panels for the purposes of travel?", "id": "58538"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2115, "text": "a temporal sequence"}], "question": "What does the enthronement of the Virgin twice suggest before and after Christ's death as represented in the center?", "id": "58539"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 212, "text": "inwards"}], "question": "Who would the wings have closed lying flush with the raised spandrel above the inner moulding for the purposes of travel?", "id": "58540"}]}, {"context": "This panel was inspired by the Madonna and Child with Saint Anne by Masaccio and Masolino", "qas": []}, {"context": "This panel formed part of a predella, which included a Visitation (Courtauld Galleries, London), a Nativity (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), an Adoration of the Magi (Courtauld Galleries, London), and a Flight into Egypt (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg).The oblong frame, with a semicircle on every corner and angular projections between them, divides the picture into three parts and Lorenzo Monaco made good use of the possibilities offered by the unusual shape of the frame. He placed the Virgin and her Child-isolated from the other figures-into the central, widest part. The Virgin is riding the ass side-saddle, as though she were sitting on a throne, and she is turned towards us. To indicate the direction of her course, her body is a little bent backwards. The oblique line of her body suggests a straight line between the upper point of the frame and the bottom inward angle on the right, and this diagonal axis is further stressed by the ass's foreleg, stepping forwards, which, continuing the same line, eventually ends in the semicircle. A similar connection between the composition and the frame can be observed in the hindmost leg of the ass and the bottom left semicircle. The oblique line of the leg is a reflected image of the axis which was mentioned previously. The horizontal line of the animal's body links the figures of the Virgin and Joseph, and, at the same time, it separates the Holy Family from the women accompanying them. The palm branches in the hands of the woman in a green cloak, and the drapery falling downwards from her arm, practically creates a line between the top and the bottom angular indentations of the frame. (According to some apocryphal gospels the fleeing Holy Family was nourished by the fruits of a palm-tree bending towards them.) The background, too, separates the left-hand side of the picture from the rest: the escorts proceed among bare, grey rocks, while the Holy Family move through woods: the foliage magically illuminates the semi-darkness.Whilst the two female figures are moving forwards, Joseph, at the head of the small group, has stopped and looks back. By this the painting representing progress in one direction becomes enclosed and symmetrical. This geometrically constructed composition with its strict rhythm by Lorenzo Monaco shows, as do all his works, that even while pursuing the best trecento traditions of Florentine art, an artist could adjust himself to the International Gothic style. Counterparts of the two women, with the long, even and soft folds of their draperies, or of the Virgin's graceful, aristocratic figure, could be found anywhere in the art of the period. On the other hand, the vigorous and definite personality of Joseph can be imagined only in Florentine art, which had old, democratic traditions.

Traditionally David was shown either as an uncompromised biblical hero slaying Goliath or as a triumphant youth displaying the giant's decapitated head. In Caravaggio's David with the Head of Goliath (Galleria Borghese, Rome), which was likely to have been sent from Naples around 1609 as a gift for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the adolescent hero gazes tenderly at his victim's head, creating a strong, almost erotic, bond. Orazio's David does not interact with Goliath's head, rather he stands beside it lost in a moment of deep introspection, evoking a pensive atmosphere similar to the mood generated in Caravaggio's St John the Baptist. Like the St John, David's body is pushed towards the picture plane and set off against a background of dense, dark foliage. This verdant background is strikingly different from the one in Orazio's small copper version (Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Berlin), in which David is framed by a rocky cliff. The difference has led some critics to suggest that Agostino Tassi was responsible for the landscape in the Spada picture, but there is no conclusive proof to substantiate this.Unlike the Berlin copper, where David is seen full-length, in the Spada version his body is cropped just below the knee and Goliath's head is turned upwards towards the viewer. It has been suggested that the Spada canvas was cut down at the bottom. However, technical evidence shows that instead it was extended on all four sides. Thus the picture would have focused more directly on the contemplative and melancholic David and the head of Goliath would have appeared to rest on the edge of the frame.

When he first arrived in Rome, he worked as a pastrycook, then as assistant to the landscape painter Agostino Tassi, whom he helped with decorative work. Not much is known about his early career. It was only in his thirties that he began to acquire stature and reputation as an artist in his own right. The German painter-biographer Joachim von Sandrart, reporting on his visit to Rome (1629-35), writes that Claude was determined 'to become familiar with nature in all its forms, and would spend whole days and late into the night in the fields, so that he learned how to convey most naturally the flush of day, the rising and setting of the sun . . .'.Characteristic features of Claude's art are the subtle moods of the landscape and the variation in the seascape with the changing seasons. People are unimportant in his pictures; the painter regarded them only as a means of lending animation to his landscapes and as a rule he did not even paint them himself. In the 1630s he started a book which he gradually filled with pen-and-ink drawings of almost 200 of his own pictures; although it does not comprise his entire oeuvre, it is nevertheless a unique documentary record of his artistic creations.

Their escutcheons are mounted on the polygonal base of the niches. These were identified as belonging to the Florentines Angelo di Jacopo Tani (1415-1492) and Caterina di Francesco Tanagli (1446-1492). Tani was an agent of the Medici bank in Bruges in 1450, before becoming its manager in 1455. He was ousted by Tommaso Portinari in 1465. Tani married in Florence in 1466, and his wife bore a daughter (one of several) on 8 June 1471. He drew up his will on 12 December 1467, the same month as he was sent back north to save the London branch from bankruptcy. The holy figures represented here evidently relate first and foremost to the devotion of the donors. The coats-of-arms were originally reversed - in other words, the man's arms appeared in the woman's panel, and vice versa.Before departing for London in December 1467, Tani founded a chapel dedicated to St Michael at his employer's church in Fiesole and drew up his will. He probably also made funeral arrangements in the customary manner. He will then have required an altarpiece, which he ordered from Memling some time after the end of 1467 during his stay in the north. The painting was, therefore, largely executed during his stay in London between 1467 and 1469, from where he could monitor its progress. The iconography of the altarpiece is clarified by its destination. St Michael has been selected here first and foremost as the saint to whom the chapel was dedicated, and only in the second place as Tani's patron.

The large number of Romanesque churches in and around the town bear testimony to the fact that it flourished in the Middle ages. It was never an area noted for painting activity, and the return of Guy Fran\ufffdois from Rome to his native region was therefore to be of great significance in local terms, much more so than similar events in other centres where there was more than one painter active. Guy Fran\ufffdois was to work in isolation for more than thirty years, gradually diluting his art as memories of what he had learned in Rome faded. The pictures that he painted in France nearly all remain in and around Le Puy.It is only in recent years that the Italian period of Guy Fran\ufffdois has been reconstructed and his Italian pictures disentangled from the work of Carlo Saraceni. Saraceni, a difficult artist to define, was essentially eclectic, with an unusual skill in brushwork almost akin to that of a northerner. He assimilated many influences, ranging from Caravaggio to the German ERlsheimer.The picture by Fran\ufffdois that most shows the influence of Saraceni is the Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth, now in the Mus\ufffde de l'Ain at Bourg-en-Bresse. Like much of Fran\ufffdois's work, it was intended as a large altarpiece. His altarpieces that survived in the Le Puy area, in the churches for which they were painted, are often surrounded by a provincial version of a sculptured and stuccoed framework in the Italian Baroque style. Although commonplace in Italy, such pictures in situ are rare in France; most seventeenth century altarpieces by the major painters are now in museums. The Holy Family altarpiece has the simplified forms sometimes found in works by Saraceni and also the strong lighting suitable for a prominent position in a church, where the picture would normally be seen from a distance.The strength of some of Guy Fran\ufffdois' compositions has led some authorities to suggest that he was influenced by Nicolas Tournier, but the most likely explanations for their superficial similarity are that both artists brought back from Italy similar Caravaggesque influences, and that both of them were forced to rely on what they had experienced and learned without renewed contact with their sources. Both painter had a predilection for monumental scale, although Fran\ufffdois never achieved Tournier's dramatic intensity.

Liss portrays one of the apostle's visions, `how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter'. Above the seated apostle, who is surrounded by books, an angel draws aside a curtain; terrified, Paul shrinks back from the expanse of heaven revealed to him. Angels playing musical instruments gambol in the clouds, and in the distance the Trinity appears. The colours range from the deep violet of Paul's cloak through the green of the curtain to the most delicate yellow, blue and pink of the clouds. This painting with its extraordinary wealth of brilliant colour is one of the artist's finest works and seems to anticipate the Venetian painting of the eighteenth century.With the exception of Adam Elsheimer, Johann Liss was the most outstanding German painter of the seventeenth century. He was born in Schleswig-Holstein c. 1597, spent several years studying in the Netherlands, where he came into contact with the Haarlem painters, principally Goltzius and Buytewech, and with the Flemish followers of Caravaggio in Antwerp (Janssens, Jordaens). Liss then made his way to Italy via Paris. To begin with, he worked in Rome, where he was a member of the Netherlandish artists' colony, and exactly when he settled in Venice is not known. Until his early death, supposedly a victim of the plague which broke out in 1629, he continued to work in Venice and it was in these last years that he produced his best-known works, among them The Ecstasy of St Paul. Together with Domenico Feti, Liss played an important part in reviving the use of rich colours, a Venetian tradition which had ended with Tintoretto.In the seventeenth century this painting was in the famous collection of the Amsterdam merchant Gerrit Reynst (died 1658), which consisted mainly of works by Venetian masters and included a companion-piece, The Vision of St Peter, which was subsequently lost. Both pictures were engraved by Jeremias Falck and attributed to Johann Liss, but it seems certain that the St Peter picture was not the work of Liss but of Domenico Feti, who was a close friend of the German painter. It may be that after Feti's death (1623), his patron decided to commission Johann Liss to paint the companion-picture to the St Peter. The Ecstasy of St Paul came up for sale in Amsterdam in 1722 with the Van de Amory Collection and found its way through a Florentine art-dealer into the Berlin collection of A. von Frey, from which it passed in 1919 to the Picture Gallery", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 312, "text": "an angel"}], "question": "Who draws aside a curtain above the seated apostle?", "id": "58631"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1226, "text": "his way to Italy via Paris"}], "question": "What did liss then make?", "id": "58632"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1376, "text": "in Venice"}], "question": "Where did Liss settle?", "id": "58633"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2340, "text": "the companion-picture"}], "question": "Who may an important part be that after Feti's death, Liss's patron decided to commission Johann Liss to paint to the St Peter?", "id": "58634"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1647, "text": "Liss"}], "question": "Who played an important part in reviving the use of rich colors?", "id": "58635"}]}, {"context": "The space of the room with a square plan (8,1 x 8,1 m) is essentially a cube, and in it Mantegna has created a monumental architectural reality by means of ribs on the ceiling connecting with pilasters on the walls, which are in turn supported by a marble socle.

Only the corbels are actually stone, the highly worked ribs, the garlands that encircle the eight busts of emperors supported by putti, and the ensembles in decorative lozenges are painted to simulate marble so convincingly that even the modern viewer is sometimes fooled.

Cecilia had taken a vow of chastity and had persuaded her husband to do likewise. Valerianus had suspected her of secretly being in love with his f riend Tiburtius but the angelic apparition allays his doubts while also heralding their approaching martyrdom.The composition - showing the three sumptuously dressed saints as they express with dignity their astonishment over the apparition of the angel - incorporates the main elements of Gentileschi's art. It represents a high point of his maturity, ranking with the Madonna of the Rosei family and the Annunciation in Turin. The disciplined, orderly construction has a Neoclassical stamp that derives from the artist's Tuscan background. The handling of the light shows the fundamental influence of Caravaggio, while the refinement of the surfaces in the gleaming satin and damask draperies and the soft warmth of the velvets are inspired by Bronzino.Typical of Gentileschi are the arrested gestures standing out against the opaque shadow of the austere interior; the figure of Tibertius, silhouetted against the light as he cautiously peers at the angel; the system of curves formed by the wings, the body and the long palm branch of the angel in flight; and the outstretched arms of St. Cecilia and St. Valerianus. The structural elements of the composition are striking: the link between Tibertius' hand and the angel's foot; the alignment of the palm branch and the organ pipes, and the wreath of flowers, St. Cecilia's hand and St. Valerianus' knee; and the parallels formed by the figures of St. Valerianus and St. Cecilia, the organ pipes and the door frame, the keyboard and the dais.

His work was much sought after internationally during his own lifetime and his reputation reached its apogee during the eighteenth century, particularly in England. The meticulous finish, careful elaboration of detail and concentration of expression, especially in those compositions with single figures, are the hallmarks of a style that proved to be influential even in the late eighteenth century in the work, for example, of Jean-Baptiste Greuze.The biblical source for the painting is Matthew 14:6-11 or Mark 6:21-8, where the daughter of Herodias danced for her stepfather, Herod, on his birthday. As a reward he promised her anything she wanted and, prompted by her mother, she chose the head of Saint John the Baptist, which she then carried to Herodias on a silver charger. The daughter subsequently became known in literature as Salome, and the theme was memorably treated in the nineteenth century by Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde amongst others.Dolci painted several versions of Salome. According to Baldinucci, the original version was painted, probably during the 1660s, for the Marchese Rinuccini in Florence and it proved to be the artists most popular work, known through two other variants of good quality (Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen and Glasgow, City Museum and Art Gallery), which in turn spawned numerous copies. Of the three versions recorded by Baldinucci, the present painting is the second, which was acquired by Sir John Finch (1626&#151;82) who gave it to Charles II.

John supports the dead Christ's head, while Mary Magdalene, her long hair flowing, lifts one of His hands to her cheek. Behind John stands Joseph of Arimathaea with an anointing-vessel, and behind the Virgin rises the upright of the bare cross, stained with the blood of the crucified Saviour; on the tree next to it can be seen the bound foot of one of the thieves. Beyond is a rocky landscape with a castle on the edge of a lake.Apart from the Berlin panel, the theme of the Lamentation occurs in only one other painting by Baldung. The picture in the Landesmuseum at Innsbruck, which bears the date 1513 and is clearly an earlier work, is much more constricted, more angular and restless in its composition. In the Berlin painting the dramatic outburst of grief on the part of John and Mary Magdalene has given way to silent resignation. This simplification of the forms and softening of the outline is also apparent in two drawings on the same theme, a sketch in Basel for the Innsbruck painting, which bears the date 1513, and a drawing in a private collection, which is dated 1515. By studying as well two woodcuts on the same subject, the consistent development of Baldung's style from early apprenticeship to the full maturity of the Berlin Lamentation shows up in a telling manner.The artist, whose family came from Swabia, was born at Weyersheim near Strasbourg. At the age of 18 he began his apprenticeship in D\ufffdrer's workshop in Nuremberg. It may have been the patricians of the imperial city who later obtained for him the commission for two altarpieces which he completed around 1507 for Halle Cathedral. One, representing the Adoration of the Magi, eventually found its way to the Berlin Gallery. While in Strasbourg, of which town he had become a burgher in 1509, he received the important commission for the high altar in Freiburg Cathedral, whereupon he moved to Freiburg and spent several years there, roughly between 1512 and 1517. It was only towards the end of the second decade, when he had completed this major work, that Baldung seems to have painted the Lamentation, in which one can detect traces of the imposing Freiburg style, a distinct departure from the late-Gothic resonances of the Innsbruck panel.Hardly anything is known about the origins of this picture.

The costume of the donor and the findings from dendrochronological investigation allow us to date the picture to the middle of the 1440s.

The figure of the red-robed St. John to the left of the Cross shows how he reworked the master's figural types to suit his own ideas. The model is St John in Rogier's Deposition (Prado, Madrid), and it is followed faithfully in such details as the right foot. The folds of the robe, however, are more strongly modeled.The cloak in particular, very dynamically draped and with a large fold flung backward over the shoulder, gives the figure a sense of agitation that is in tune with the character of this painting as a whole, but not with its model. Similarly, Mary Magdalene's cloak slipping down from her hips picks up a motif from the Deposition, but combines it with an extrovert gesture foreign to that picture, with the saint suddenly flinging up her arms.The series of the three panels follows a chronological sequence: the sculptural Annunciation group in the donor's loggia refers to Christ's becoming man; in the central panel Christ has just died, and the sun and moon turn dark as His companions break into loud lamentations; on the right Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, and a servant are approaching with a ladder to take the dead body down from the Cross", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1082, "text": "in Rogier's Deposition"}], "question": "What is the model St John in?", "id": "58796"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 597, "text": "to the middle of the 1440s"}], "question": "What do the costume of the donor and the findings from dendrochronological investigation allow us to date the picture to?", "id": "58797"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 152, "text": "in the Netherlands"}], "question": "Where were Piedmont active in banking?", "id": "58798"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 889, "text": "by an assistant in Rogier's workshop"}], "question": "Who must the design of the triptych have been by?", "id": "58799"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1082, "text": "in Rogier's Deposition"}], "question": "Where is the model St John?", "id": "58800"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 141, "text": "in banking"}], "question": "What were Piedmont active in in the Netherlands?", "id": "58801"}]}, {"context": "This painting shows a view of an imaginary port with ruins, a galley at anchor, fishermen and members of nobility", "qas": []}, {"context": "Catalogue numbers: F 356, JH 1248", "qas": []}, {"context": "\"In the fertile years that followed his D\ufffdjeuner and Olympia, Manet experimented very widely.

Their clothes have been creased into countless shifting folds which cut across one another at right angles. Van der Goes is revealed as a penetrating analyst of religious feeling, of grief and devotion, and of the agitation they can cause.

Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space. Later, in 1514 Boccaccino received the commission to begin a fresco cycle of the life of Mary and Christ on the walls of the nave. They begin on the left wall, running from the fa\ufffdade to the apse and then on the right wall from the apse back to the fa\ufffdade. The left wall is dedicated to Mary and Christ's childhood; the right to the Passion.Boccaccino divided the rectangular sections above the arcades of the nave into two fields by painted pilasters. The scenes of the fresco cycle were placed into these sections. In 1514-15 Boccaccino began with the first four scenes of the story of Mary above the first and second arches of the arcade: Annunciation to Joachim; Meeting at the Golden Gate; Birth of Mary; Betrothal of Mary. Boccaccino painted the next four scenes of the cycle in 1515-17 above the third and fourth arches: Annunciation to Mary; Visitation; Adoration of the Shepherds; Circumcision of Christ.In designing the cycle Boccaccino followed a famous model, Albrecht D\ufffdrer's woodcut series Life of the Virgin. Boccaccino did not copy D\ufffdrer's inventions, but found inspiration in just a few crucial constellations of figures. For the individual motifs, the formal language of the details, and the shaping of the whole, Boccaccino followed Italian traditions.In the Meeting at the Golden Gate, the tender embrace of Joachim and Anna is united by the arch of the gate over their heads.

These were strongly influenced by those that Peter Paul Rubens had produced for the same families almost two decades earlier. From these Van Dyck borrowed the structures and the chromatic oppositions between the dark, court clothing and the bright ruffs, embroideries and jewels. The painting in the Brussels museum is a good example of this type of official representation.Porzia Imperiale and her daughter Maria Francesca belonged to a family of Genoese bankers. On 5 August 1610 the mother married Bartolomeo Imperiale, probably a distant cousin. Born in around 1586, she must have been between 35 and 40 when Anthony van Dyck stayed in Genoa. Maria Francesca's date of birth is not known, but the inscription Virtute gaudet (she rejoices in virtue) on the virginal, exalting the young girl's honour, shows that she was of marriageable age. Women occupied a special place in the Republic of Genoa. It is therefore not surprising to see them associated with Virtue, a quality with heroic connotations that is more generally ascribed to men.Porzia Imperiale, seated here, is dressed in a black gown, its severity softened by an imposing ruff, a double chain, engraved buttons and lace-edged cuffs. In her left hand she carries a closed fan, whilst her right hand rests on the arm of the chair. Her daughter wears a light-coloured gown with silvery reflections, decorated with gilded braid and a ruff, its moir\ufffd reflections very finely balancing the dark mass of her mother's gown. Porzia Imperiale's determined face contrasts with Maria Francesca's gentle and innocent looks. The background architectural details and the heavy red drapery confer a monumental aspect to the painting, further accentuated by the way in which the figures literally dominate the spectator, who views them from a low-angle position.
